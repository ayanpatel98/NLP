2,"Well, I don't like the newer Gillette razors, and this one is included. Shaving my face is like shaving a gorilla's. The razor is comfortable due to only gliding over my face. The ones with off-set blades are the worst. I find no improvement over dual blades with this one, good thing I still have an Atra.",1
2,"I didn't see any improvements, I recommend almond oil, cleared up my eczema in about one use and only have to use it once a week or less, great for scalp and skin in general, also the oil's too large to fill in pores so no zits, it's the perfect cure",1
1,"I'm sure this is great for peachfuzz, but real men don't have time for toys like this.  Stick to your Mach3 or whatever real blades you already use.  It's really a shame that these things don't really work effectively.  Oh, and there's really nothing like constantly rubbing the same area of your face over and over again with harsh metal that doesn't really cut it.  Stick to razors, men.",1
2,I got this product about 3 weeks ago and i still do not see a difference . My blackheads are still there. I used it with water the first 2-3 times but found with water was a bit hard to apply so i switch to raw apple cider vinegar and it went on smoothly . Im going to continue using this product and hopefully i see a change.  Btw i have a few pimples and a tons of red marks .,1
1.0,"This was a great product. Now it is mediocre because it causes breakouts. When the product was sold, iman had to change the formulation. More comedogenic components are now included, sadly.",1
2,"I was very disappointed in this product.  I ordered it to bleach my daughter's hair.  She has very short hair and there was not even enough product to cover her hair completely.  The product seemed to lift the color well but there was just not enough.  I should have purchased two kits for her short hair and can't imagine how many you would need to do medium or long hair.  The product description stated that for long hair, two kits may be needed but my daughters hair is maybe 3&#34; long all over so I thought the one would be sufficient.",1
1,I've been using it since I bought it (more than a month ago) and I don't see any difference on my lashes.. it doesn't work at all.. I wish I can return it!,1
2,"I have recently been on the hunt for a good quality, relatively inexpensive lighted mirror for my room so that I can apply makeup in the morning before work. I've never owned a lighted mirror before, and always just used a regular table-top vanity mirror with a goose-neck clip-on light. It worked fine for me, but I wanted something more practical due to limited bedroom space. After browsing Amazon for several mirrors, I liked the look of this Jerdon LED mirror the best, and bought it based on the high star rating.<br /><br />When I received it, the lights did not work at all. I tried two different sets of new batteries... and nothing. It was a small annoyance, but Amazon sent out another one immediately and the new one worked just fine.<br /><br />It's a nice quality mirror itself, and I really like the mini magnified mirror, but the lighting is just odd to me. It is EXTREMELY bright and distracting but is okay as long as you don't focus on them. But the reason it is odd to me is that despite how bright the LED lights are, it still doesn't produce a whole lot of light in the mirror reflection. It seems like a contradiction, but nevertheless that is what I experienced. The lighting is just not good enough for me to feel comfortable applying makeup.<br /><br />I did not experience some other issues people were having, such as the mirror not staying in place when tilting it, or the screw not fitting. I assembled it just fine and it seemed pretty sturdy to me, and had no problems keeping the mirror in place where I wanted it to be. This could have been a great mirror, but I ended up returning it to Amazon and kept searching for my perfect mirror.<br /><br />On a final note, I just want to say that I ended up purchasing about 4 different mirrors here on Amazon, until I realized that if I wanted a really good-quality makeup mirror I was going to have to pay for it. I just couldn't find one bright enough for my needs, and ended up purchasing the SimpleHuman sensor mirror. It is very expensive, and I had certainly NOT intended to pay such a price for a mirror, but it really is perfect and I consider it an investment.It is very expensive, and I had certainly NOT intended to pay such a price for a mirror, but it really is perfect and I consider it an investment.",1
1,Just as beautiful as the photo but it broke when I tried to put it in my hair.,1
1,"Barely any color except the dark brown. Waste of money, I replaced it with physicians formula which I love. This went in the bin after a number of tries and wanting to like it. Disappointing.",1
1,"these are so weak you can hardly smell them, and the good news is these are so weak you can hardly smell them. I say good news, because they don't smell very nice. The vanilla to me smells the best, but it's also the weakest. I have it in a very small bathroom, and you can hardly smell it walking in. The Morning Dew smells unpleasant and harsh, and the Sea Petal doesn't smell much better. The scents are one dimensional, and not very pleasant. I got so many of these for me and gifts, and all the unopened ones are going back. I guess there was a reason these were so marked down! I'm very disappointed as the initial reviews were good, and I and many people bought these based on those reviews which were misleading, and false.",1
2,The original photo showed shampoo AND conditioner that is the ONLY reason I ordered the product. The shampoo is decent but not worth the cost without the conditioner.,1
1,Sure it's cheap but the hat is awful. Not baggy at all. It's stiff and it sheds. I would rate it lower if I could.,1
1,"I have bought other oils from this company and loved them. This has got to be the worst smelling oil I have ever smelled, it smells nothing like peppermint! do not waste your money.The smell makes me sick to my stomach.",1
1,"This was false advertising , the case is not full of makeup it has a large empty box in it that takes up most of the space , SUPREMELY DISAPPOINTED AND WILL NOT BE PURCHASING OR RECOMMENDING AGAIN",1
1,Hate it. Not worth your money!!!,1
1,I've purchased this hair dryer twice. I like the dryer so when the first one burned out after very little use I thought it was a fluke and purchased another one. The second one also quit working after very little use. I'll never buy another Andis product again.,1
2,Ehhhh who knows if this really works?,1
2.0,Just ok. Too much glitter.,1
1,I thought the mouth piece was detachable- it was not which made it hard to use. You are supposed to clean from the bottom of the tooth up and this is very difficult with this unit.,1
1,"I decided to try for the first time, so I ordered 3 different flavors. That was the 2nd mistake! The shisha dried so quickly, within a few minutes of putting the charcoal on. A burnt, smoky smell overwhelmed the flavor. The final mistake was to doubt the first box, and trying the 2nd flavor. It was just as bad. I was so unhappy with myself that I trashed all and did not even bother to attempt to try the unused ones.<br />I do not recommend this to any friend of mine. Maybe they are meant to use in other hookas. If so, I do not know which.",1
1,Product was dried out.  Not smooth or creamy.,1
1,It was broken and melted. Completely useless,1
1,"as the others say the hots fall off always. i bought mine at a tobacco shop and thought it was great,till i burnt a hole in my new jacket!!!!!!! dont bother with this machine. this is the only product that i have not bought on here but had to post my thoughts on it i think if they made the spring drive a little longer loops it would work better as it is it makes the tobacco way too fine like the box says chops the tobacco well it powderizes it!!!!!",1
1,"I bought this product to help even out some redness and solve mild acne. NOTHING...it burned a little after being on for 15 minutes, but once I rinsed I couldn't tell any difference in my skin, nor could I after 2 weeks of using this product every other day! What a scam!",1
1,"I have extremely sensitive teeth and I do use the regular Sensodyne and really like it, it helps greatly. But, I bought this new Sensodyne and as soon as I started to brush my teeth I could not get this stuff off of my teeth fast enough. It felt as if I was brushing my teeth with acid. Horrible, horrible pain!  I thought maybe I ate something to make my teeth more sensitive and it was just a fluke, but I tried again the next day and the pain immediately came back.  I will keep using the old Sensodyne, but this new stuff is heading for the trash can.",1
1,Hard to fill and it leaks.,1
1,Either this is a bad product or it's counterfeit.,1
1,Threw it away. Burned so bad,1
2,"The battery barely lasts and if it runs out, then you're out of luck. Not only will it not work because the charge is gone, but even if you try to plug it in, it still won't work until the battery recharges. Also, you cannot replace the battery.<br /><br />The stand doesn't even seem like it's made for the unit and everything falls out of it.",1
2,"Price was right, shipping was timely, but item looked like it had been sitting on a shelf for a bit (smudgy, dusty, etc.)",1
2,This brand of socks have been a great help to me to relieve vein pressure in my legs.  The first pair I purchased lasted over 2 months with daily use.  This pair that I purchased recently from Amazon proved to be very disappointing.  Within less than 2 weeks they ran and I had to already stitch a hole that formed on the bottom of the sock.,1
2,"I had discovered this scent at a Perfumania and loved the idea of trying it out before I committed to a large bottle.  It smelled great going on, but the scent disappears as soon as it dries!",1
1,did not operate at all,1
1,I tried many times but this didn't stay up in the tile wall of my bathtub :( very disappointed,1
2,"This product may work for those with a mild case of hyperhydrosis, or just someone who sweats a little and would rather they didn't, but for a sufferer of extreme hyperhydrosis, this product did basically nothing for me.<br /><br />Drysol works great but irritates my skin to the point where I had to stop using it. Driclor works wonders though without the irritation, but the price here on amazon has skyrocketed from the $13 I paid a few months ago to North of $60. I'm actively seeking another source.",1
1,smells bad on my skin,1
1,I have used Lovely for several bottles. This is the first one that the perfume does not stay on. There are not many reasons why the perfume does not stay.,1
1,I bought this item in November 2013.  I used it on a semi-regular basis for ~ 6 weeks and then it just stopped working altogether.  I would not purchase it again.  For the money I paid I would expect it to last a few years.  Especially considering that I didi not use it everyday or on high settings.,1
1,It arrived with a crease in one of the screens.  So..I really bought one replacement set for the twice of two.,1
1,I am very disappointed.  The scent does not last long at all and doesn't quite smell like Chanel No. 5.,1
2,"I bought 5 and I don't think I'm going to use them, they seem harsh on my hair and they are not very flexible.",1
1,very heavy and artificial,1
1,New formula is terrible. Leaks everywhere especially when exposed to low pressure on airplanes. Drips down body after application. Mitchum pls bring the original formula back!! Used for 15+ yrs now have to switch.,1
1,"AWFUL Does not Work, Sloppy Function, AND non-returnable. SCREWED ON THIS PURCHASE... BUYER BEWARE",1
1.0,"I have used MANY different lotions, butters, and creams over the years. Based on the reviews of this cream I was sure that I would love it, unfortunately, I was wrong, I dont like it. In my opinion, it is very watery, much more like a lotion than a cream. I was looking for something very moisturizing and thick like a typical cream, but this was very disappointing. I have to massage it into my skin for much longer than usual just to get it to absorb a bit because its so watery and thin. Then it still doesnt feel like its doing anything for my skin, theres no real benefit to using it, no long term moisturizing effects. I understand what another review meant saying it kind of sits on top of the skin, as soon as I shower or wash my hands, that's it, it doesn't absorb in and moisturized my skin like other lotions & creams do. I wish I had tried a smaller container from walmart before I just jumped into buying 6 containers. Also, I recieved the package with one of the containers broken and leaking cream all over the other ones. I wish I could return them but I think its been too long. I tried to use it for a while to give a fair review, the price is very attractive but I would much rather spend a little more money on a CREAM that I actually really like and will benefit my skin long term. Obviously, many other people feel differently about this cream, so I would just suggest that you try it before you buy 6 of them or only buy one so you know if you really like this stuff, its not for everybody. I prefer a cream like Cetaphil by a landslide, I love that stuff & now I see a justification for the higher price tag but I don't mind paying it all all  Cetaphil is great. I don't like giving bad reviews & I'm not trying to bad mouth this company just want others to be sure before you go and buy 6, like I said, its just not for everybody.",1
2,I ordered this in november and just now got it in February. the only time it changes color is if you put it under almost burning hot water. i've tried to put it on numerous ways but it still only works with very hot water. You're basically just getting a red gel nail polish.,1
1,Was not thrilled with this.  In fact I am returning it.,1
2,As a Mary Kay consultant you can get this cheaper.,1
2,not at all what product claimed it would be,1
1,"Usually the price of the replacement brushes are much more expensive at the store. This deal (on-line) was too good to be true.  I'm already on my second brush head within one week.  The small hole below the brush head pinches my lip everytime it makes contact with it and the attachement doesn't stay connected to the toothbrush.  Furthermore, the first brush head that I used only last around 4 days.  It literally broke up into little pieces in my mouth. Buy them at the store...",1
1,"Not usable due to length and diameter. Painful and irritating to start using, surface is too grippy, no matter what you put on it to smooth it out",1
1,very poor quality,1
2,"I used this product for several years in my twenties. Now I'm in my thirties and had not bought it in a while, so I decided to order a bottle. The product still smelled the same when I opened the bottle and smelled the same on me. However, I'm thinking I either got a bad/contaminated bottle or they've changed some of the ingredients. My friend ordered some the same day I did and had the same reaction, so it really could just be a bad batch, but we were so upset. This has the sweetest fruity and enticing smell on both of us, but now we smell like cortisone.....since we both had to go to the dermatologist and get a shot and some cream for our face, neck and hands!<br />I hate giving this a bad review, because I used to love it so much. I know our bodies change with age, so that could have something to do with it, but the doctor said that if it really was my body, the product wouldn't smell the same, so again, either a bad batch, or they've added an ingredient.",1
2,"I've tried several other eye creams that all claim to reduce bags/puffiness, and dark circles. None have done anything whatsoever. I even spent a boatload of money to try Chamonix's Genucel -- their marketing says you will see a difference &#34;within 12 hours.&#34; All lies. Genucel is vastly overpriced and it doesn't work AT ALL. I didn't have much hopes for this Hydrolyze, and it didn't live up to its promise, either, but seemed maybe a tiny bit better than most of these worthless products that claim to be able to reduce under-eye puffiness but don't really do anything. When you first put it on, you feel a gentle bit of warmth, a very pleasant feeling, actually. That made me think it might be doing something, then again, maybe they put whatever ingredients they did to give it a warming feeling just to MAKE you feel like it was doing something. At first I thought it was doing something and wrote a positive review, but now after finishing the bottle, I see that this product is nearly as worthless as all the others. I was also disappointed that as I got near the bottom the jar, the product got thick and cakey. The product also often flakes off, making it look like you're peeling after a bad sunburn. Not worth the money; will not be buying again.",1
2,This is the 3rd. time I had to replace the Panasonic shaver foil as it gets damaged and cause injury in no time. It might be acceptable if the price of the foil is not exajurated.<br />Needless to say my next shaver won't be Panasonic!!!!,1
1.0,I couldn't feel any menthol in this lotion.  I couldn't even smell anything.  I was disappointed.  They bottles are little bigger than a deck of cards!,1
1,"I have only used it three times, no change so far.  Seems as though drops would be easier, sure would on fingernails.",1
2,"Chrysin is a naturally occurring flavone, a type of flavonoid. It is found in the passion flowers Passiflora caerulea[1] and Passiflora incarnata,[2] and in Oroxylum indicum.

The results showed that chrysin had no effect on estrogen levels. Further, the mice treated with chrysin became considerably fatter, possibly due to chrysin's ability to disrupt thyroid function.[18][full citation needed][unreliable source?] Another study on rats administered 50 mg of chrysin per kg body weight, considerably more than found in dietary supplements.

1,This does not work. I used it diligently for a month and there was absolutely no difference.,1
1,"I think it made me breakout even worse. Also, the cleaner dries your face to the point it hurts. This product does not work at all!",1
1.0,"did not like how it made my face feel,does smell nice but not what I expexted",1
1,"I have been using these Braun Oral B electric brushes for over 20 years.  I have never encountered a brush head so stiff, and unusable in all those years.  I used to by OEM products in bulk at BJ's.  Not finding them there I decided to try these.  They are in my opinion misrepresented as they are definitely hard and not listed that way.    There are some reviews that address this issue, but many \\""peculiar\\"" positive reviews that either have a different brush head, or are clueless as to how a toothbrush should be made.    As a health care professional, selling these type of products for over 30 years, I am perplexed by the seemingly uselessness of the reviews of this product.  They steered me wrong for sure, and I'll buy OEM next time.    I found 1 remaining OEM and switched back to it and it is night and day softer than this \\""generic\\"" brush.  I could have sought out a refund, but it's not worth my time.  I'd rather spend the time on a review to save others the aggravation of a poorly executed product in my opinion.",1
1,Poor quality,1
1,Great product but terrible price. This is doubled the retail price including tax and shipping.,1
1,"Maybe I got a bad batch, but the bars of this soap that I received have absolutely NO lemon smell. They barely have any aroma whatsoever. I might as well use the odorless Neutrogena soap. Very disappointing.",1
1,You've got to be out of your mind to want to sell this for the price listed. Just because it's a retired scent does NOT mean the price should as high as it is. Still on the search for a reasonable price for this lovely scent but just thought I'd comment on the ridiculous price this is going for. Props to whoever would fork out the money for it.,1
2,"When it comes right down to it, this is actually just a fancy box with baby pictures on it, with a box of regular Q-tips.  It's not even the special safety ones for babies.  Total waste.  If you're looking for just a regular Q-tip with a pretty box, this is your thing.  Otherwise, if it's the safety Q-tips, I would stay away since it's definitely not what you think it is.",1
1,"rips my hair out, hurts, i was hoping it would be good but i can't handle it, it hurts too much to use",1
1,"This wax does remove the hair but OH MY GOSH, it is such a pain in the butt to remove off your skin! The \\""Wax Off\\"" solution doesn't even work. It just makes the wax creamy-sticky instead of just sticky! Getting this crap off my nails is another issue for sure! If you want really GOOD wax, then It's all about the Persian Wax.. That product comes off with water! Seriously, I'm throwing out my Gigi wax after I post this!",1
2,"well,these do NOT look natural to me at all. i understand this is not for everyday look and it is probably for more of a dramatic look, but even when i do smokey eye type of makeup when i go out at night, they still dont look that nice on me. they just look sooo fake.lol.<br />I have been wearing fake eyelashes for a  while and i definitely dont think these are for asian girls.<br />Also, they are very hard to bent, so they are kinda hard to put on.",1
2,It did add a tint to my skin but the product does rub off onto clothing!,1
2,too slimy,1
2,"Maybe I just don't know how to use a flat iron, but this just doesn't seem to do what I need.",1
1,Worst hair dryer ever! After reading reviews that said this dryer was good for long thick curly hair I purchased it. I've given it a chance over and over but it does not dry my hair.  Stay away if you have thick hair!,1
1,I ordered 6 bottles and I have used all the 6 bottles and I do not see a difference yet.,1
2,"If you have oily eyelids, this is not for you. It works fine but only if you use it everday consistently for more than two month's . other than that it can be pretty toublesome to use if you have never used tape before.",1
2,Very pretty but space between the comb is too close which makes it had for the hair to go through without hurting the baby.  if your infant has lots of hair at birth he or she can't use the comb for more than a few weeks after birth. The lines between the comb are just too close.,1
2,"This is a very nice little ten dollar trimmer. Pity that I paid Amazon.com almost TWENTY-TWO DOLLARS for it. Yes, it IS CORDLESS...it requires a \\""AA\\"" battery! (Yes, had I read the fine print, I would have known this but for TWENTY-TWO DOLLARS, you would kind of expect a RECHARGEABLE, model, especially considering that there are numerous rechargeable trimmers starting at around fifteen dollars.)

1,"I bought this product a walgreens actually and it was the one with the handle not just the regular ped egg. Well at first I was pretty happy with the product till after 3-4 applications I noticed my calluses worsened. They were coming back with a vengeance. Not fun at all. The first time in my life I now have cracked feet. I would not recommend this product as it shaves your heels and it should be a surgical tool. I didn't even think about it, but I heard before if you shave or cut it it'll just get worst. So please don't buy this product.",1

1,very very poor quality,1
2,"My hair naturally is a dark blonde. In the summertime it still gets super blonde. However I go to a salon every 5 weeks to get blonde highlights. It's expensive, and the week or two before I get my highlights done my roots need a boost.

Be careful when using this product - it contains peroxide which can result in orange locks. I am not sure how it works for non-treated hair, could be helpful.",1
1,I love this product but this price is high. I buy it at my local Food Lion for $5 a bottle.,1
1,I feel like I have wasted my money on this product. This is total non sense product please dont waste your money on this.,1
1,"Everyone is right.  The old lotion for me was the best lotion out there.  the new one that says \\""smoothing\\"" is terrible.  Horrible new floral smell & doesn't work as well.",1

2,"I don't know how people rate this product.<br />I mean, how do they know if it really is inhibiting hair grow or not? Compared with other products?

It seriously could use some fragrance to mask the bad smell.",1

1.0,Extremely sparkly do not recommend putting on unless makeup goes over the top,1
1,3 out of 4 diffusers don't work! I.think it's just a cheaply made product. Save your money and spend a little more to get a better diffuser. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone!,1
1,"Terrible, fibers get all over everything, hardly sticks to the hair. I found the xfusion hair fibers much better, not perfect, but better. However, the xfusion applicator was a waste of money. I was offered an improved applicator, but it would have cost me more to mail the old one back, so never bothered.",1
1,"There was no way for me to hide the adhesive tape unless I put it directly in my hair, which would not work because it doesn't stick well to hair. Anywhere on my face that I tried to place it stuck out like a sore thumb.",1
2,"Mediocre and overpriced.  These are at best average blades or worse.  They are neither exceptionally sharp nor especially smooth.  If you care about sharpness above all else, get a Feather from Japan.  If you want something that's a good combination of sharpness and smoothness that is cheap buy the Astras which rarely exceed $11 per hundred.  If you want the very best combination of smoothness and sharpness, I'd recommend the Gillette Silver Blues, Polsilver, Gillette Platinum or Gillette 7 O'Clock Black.  All of those cost at most $25 to $35 per hundred delivered to your door.  Don't be fooled by the &#34;Made in Germany&#34; tag.  For safety razor blades, the best from Japan, Russia, and India are much better and cheaper.",1
2,"My upper dentures have never fit well, and were made too big for my mouth. My dentist told me to just &#34;get another set&#34; when I hadn't even paid off the first. But anyway, I could not get these to fit and sit correctly. Glad others had more success.",1
1,"This candle doesn't even smell pleasant. It doesn't smell at all like strawberries, it just stinks. The wax seems very rough and burns quickly. I burned this for a few hours and half was gone. I threw it out because I couldn't even stand to walk by it when it wasn't lit. I can't even describe the smell, but I do not recommend these candles. Soy Inspiration makes great soy candles, but they seem to be unavailable. Don't waste your money on these candles.",1
2,"meh , these last maybe a shave or two. Much more durable and smooth options out there.",1
2.0,The colors were o.k.; nothing exceptional but when I opened the lipstick tube everyone of the lipsticks fell out. I was very surprised.  I will not buy this product again.  I opened them at work in front of some other employees and they will not be buying these either.,1
2,When I got this nail polish it looked very good and pretty but when I opened the bottle it was goopy and thick inside and it was very gross.,1
1,"I wish I had seen the previous review. This is not the pro-argin toothpaste advertised.

1.0,Don't buy.. Looks nice tho,1
1.0,Handle get burning hot after a few minutes of use!  Scary! I have to turn it off and let the handle cool down so I can finish drying my medium length hair.,1
2,This doesn't stay on.. I tried another brand that  stays A LOT BETTER.....I won't buy this again  :(,1
1,"It was priced at a sale saying it was only $2 per nail package...wasn't even worth that! They're actually so cheap it's tacky! They stick for five minutes, and I KNOW how to apply these, push the cuticle back, use acetone on the nail so it will stick better, and take your time to apply the sticker.  I have literally bought some at the dollar store before that have much more quality.  Never buying this rip off again!  Save your money and click on another product.  They say you get what you pay for, I didn't even get that!",1
2,The design doesn't come out well. You would need bright colors but also have to paint in the details to make out what the design is. I would much rather just paint an image.,1
1,"These scissors actually spring open sideways and clamp your hair instead of cutting it. I've never seen anything so bad.  OK to cut one or two hairs at a time but if you're used to holding hair between your fingers and lopping off a clump, forget these.  I went to R***A*** and bought their house brand scissors for half the price and got better results.",1
1,I purchased this from Sephora before and this was SO not the same quality I couldn't even use it. I had to throw it away. Cheap imitation. You get what you pay for as they say.,1
1,"my hair would put Raggedy Anne to shame. This is a bright, in your face obviously fake red. I just wanted to boost my colour back because it got bleached by chemicals in the water while I was underway. I am horrified, embarrassed and now I have to work like this.<br /><br />Stay far away from this henna product.",1
1,"Worked absolutely wonderfully until I lost the recharge base unit.  Now the darn thing has been discontinued!!!  Partly my fault for losing it, but what a waste of money for only having it a few months.  Will not buy from them again because who knows what else will be discontinued...",1
2,"First off, shame on me for buying a $15 hair dryer, however, I previously always bought my hair dryers (99% of the time Revlon brand) from Kohl's with those coupons they always give out and those dryers lasted for years! This one lasted for 8 months and then this morning just stopped working out of nowhere. The back is not clogged with dust, it's actually very clean still. It didn't overheat because I had just turned it on. The wires are fine and still intact. No idea why it stopped working but I can only assume it was because it was a cheapo $15 one.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy again or recommend.",1
1,"The picture of the grind guard depicts 2 grind guards, and is the extremely similar to the image used by Discount Infomercial Products for this product; in which they are selling 2 of these guards. This constitutes false advertising; in which the seller is showing 2 guards but only selling one; and should be considered unacceptable by all of Amazon's customers. The seller either needs to be explicit that the picture does not represent the product accurately, or use a picture that only includes what's being sold. I have left a seller review and also filed an investigation with Amazon's rule-violation team, as well as returned my used product for a refund. This is completely unacceptable.",1
1.0,Not that great.,1
1,"It does not hold a charge now.  I think it needs a new battery, but my old one did not need a  battery this soon.",1
1,"The product seems to be a beauty aid.  However, the ad describes my novel, The Mask of Freya, whose title by coincidence sounds like the beauty product.  I have nothing against the beauty product, but I had to give it one star so I could enter this correction.  The problem of mistaken identity has been on this page forever and nothing I do seems to get it off!  Karl Larew",1
1,"I'm using it over 2 months, and the cellulite still the same :(<br />I don't this it works at all, save your $$$!",1
1,"I have been wearing d'Hadrien for YEARS.  I ordered 2 bottles (different sizes) so I would have the 1 oz to travel with.  The 3 oz bottle was fine, however, the 1 oz. bottle was rancid. I did not put it on until I was away at a wedding and had to re-shower because it was so bad.  To make matters worse, when I went in to my account to return it I was told it could not be returned because it was a flammable liquid.",1
1,It was a waste of money it smells really bad,1
1,The product it's self is fine. However I wasn't aware it would take almost 2 mths to get. I didn't want to wait that long so I ended up buying a set from Sally's. Now I have 2.,1
1,"So, admittedly, I bought this thinking that it was A*Men.  User error.  Fair enough.  What I got tho was appalling.  It smells like crappy fake jean paul gautier.  The bottle came with the plastic in separate pieces.  overall terrible experience.<br /><br />Its even worse than I thought.  After I snapped the shoddy plastic casing back together, it fell apart again.  Why?  because the GLUE GUN GLUE which is there as filler (the bottle doesnt even fill the plastic case) shifted around.  This is some creepy prop style reproduction of an excellent product.<br /><br />Look at the front of the box -- the angel wings are actually roach antennae.  No joke.",1
1,"Bought 2, both stopped working. One was within the 90 day warranty and was replaced however that one is not working properly either. One diffuser only works for about 2 minutes then turns off. The other diffusers is really loud and will run for days, unit gets hot as well. The mechanics need work. None of them worked more than 4 months.",1
1,"There's a reason pocket combs are mostly hard plastic. Plastic is cheap and is hard to break.<br />Bought this on a whim. Much bigger then you need a pocket comb to be. Finish is pretty rough.<br />The one I received was black, not the tortise shell brown in the picture.<br />Worse, two of the comb's teeth broke the second time I had it in my pocket.<br />A complete waste of money.",1
1,"It does NOT work for me.  Really disappointed as it came highly recommended by a friend who raved about it.<br /><br />I showered at 8am, applied Primal Pit Paste per the instructions on the tube, & went to work (desk job in freezing cold office).  Around 2:15pm, I took a whiff to see how things were going...Hello, FUNKY TOWN!  It was as if I forgot to put on deodorant entirely.  Not the end of the world as I'm not an especially odor-rific person, but still, very disappointing.  I've tried 8 or 10 natural deodorants over the past months and have found 2 or 3 that do a much better job.<br /><br />I also purchased the Primal Pit Paste that comes in a little jar.  Trying it tomorrow, but not feeling very optimistic...",1
1,"I tried to use this product for several days, but each day I had underarm odor by mid-morning.... With only minor activity.  I threw the rest away.  (Just a note, this product was made in France.)",1
2,"Initial impression was very positive. Unfortunately, like most of We Vibe's products, this one suffers nearly fatal flaws that makes it a terrible product.<br /><br />The primary problem with this device is nearly insurmountable. It is, essentially, designed wrong. The charging cord connects to the vibrator with two metal pins and problematically weak magnets. Unfortunately, the plastic housing is designed so that the contacts barely touch and the magnets are so weak that the connector cannot actually hold onto the vibrator to recharge it properly.<br /><br />I've played with two of these now and both of them suffer from the same problem. I can very carefully and firmly hold the pieces together to get the vibrator to charge, but this is impractical for actual use.<br /><br />We have purchased and tried several other we vibe products and each has had some design flaw that has, over time, made the toy useless or hated for the problems. They are very nearly amazing and perfect products. It's unfortunate and disappointing.<br /><br />I think it may be possible to make this unit usable with some kind of custom built multiple rubberized vice setup, but obviously that's a stupid requirement.<br /><br />The vibrations from the device are quite good. The interface button is OK, not great. It's difficult to grab ahold of when slippery and can slip inside and be a bit clumsy to remove.",1
2,"I Had the original Trouble, this product just doesnt quite wear the same. Initially it smells the same, but then it changes. This came from canada and the information was sparse. Too bad Boucheron stopped making it, Trouble was my favorite perfume ever.",1
1,The bottle was broken The bottle was broken the bottle was broken and most of the spilled perfumeee that was so bad,1
2,"I was able to try the Secret outlast clear gel deodorant because I am a bzz agent and I get products to review and give my feed back, back to the company. I received it free to review the product sample from Secret and bzzagent. I was excited to get it and I had to spread the word about what I was doing and why. But once I received the item I took it out of the box and it has a nice package and the scent is great. I though do not think that it is for me. I didn't like how it felt sticky after I applied it. It left that sticky feeling all day. Then I also don't feel that it held up to the protection that it was to do. I was telling my friends about it and they want to try it too. So I asked them what do you think? Some liked it and others did not. the scent was the winning thing about the deodorant overall. It has nice a nice appearance. Some of my pals liked that it did give them that protection and was fresh all day. But then there was me and a few others that thought it was sticky and left that sticky feeling and the unprotected feeling. I would recommend this to others just because it didn't work for me doesn't mean it didn't work for a few of my friends.",1
2,IT DIDNT LOOK LIKE COLOR IN THE PICTURE. MY HUSBAND MADE ME GIVE IT AWAY HE JUST DIDNT LIKE IT ON ME. BUT IT DID COME ON TIME AND IN GOOD SHAPE,1
1,"I was hoping for a miracle. Instead I got a product that my dog is allergic to. Listing the ingredients would be nice as my dog has been tested and Eucalyptus one the many things she is allergic to. If I had know the ingredents, I never would have wasted my money. How is a product that is made from plants, flowers, leaves, and herbs, good for dogs that are allergic to most everything list in the ingredients. I feel bad cuz as soon as I put in on my dog, she started scratching so bad she broke open her skin. Smells bad, doesnt work, ingredients are HYPER allergenic. Use with caution or avoid all together.",1
1,I still didn't get my stuff yet<br />It been really long time<br /><br />Can u tell me what I have to do to get that<br />I mad a payment for it<br />N it takeing so long,1
1,"The reviews are posted every few days, probably by the same person.  Someone in marketing or sales for this product trying to pad the reviews.<br />I have never tried the product, so I can't comment on if it does reduce dark circles.  But most products don't work, so it is not realistic that so many people had so much success.",1
2,They are rather smaller compared to other tear drop sponges I have used.,1
1,"It does not work....I've used 1 full tube and have another and will use it, but so far nothing has changed....How do I know this?  Because I took a picture of my hands when I first started and there's nothing different,,,,,,,,I'm so darn sorry that it didn't work because my hands realy need to be the help.",1
2,Nowhere did the product description state that this was the Verbena DKNY.  I thought I was buying the original Pure DKNY.  Very unhappy.,1
2,will stay inside instead of spraying this on me to deter bugs...please make these fragrance free folks!! I have allergies to certain perfumes and fragrances...thx!,1
1,"I had high expectations for this product between the Fekkai name and the favorable reviews.  It performed poorly.  Like dumping talcum powder on my head.  I tried very little.  I tried a lot.  I tried to brush it through a little, tried to brush it through a lot.  Whichever way I tried, this product just didn't work.",1
1,"After reading these reviews I was really hoping for a nice, sharp clipper.  However, these are one of the worst I've ever used.  Does not provide a clean cut, cuts similar to cheap Trim clippers.  I will stick to Tweezerman and even Revlon.",1
1,"I purchased this product because of the positive reviews I read. I therefore feel I should include a review of my own. The hair dryer was extremely hot. I could only withstand use on the cool-down setting. Even “low” was too hot. In addition, the dryer was very loud. Also, I was unable to get the hose to go back into the carrying case. I was finally able to get the drying cap back in the case, but it was extremely difficult.  After a couple of months of use, the carrying case melted on the bottom (probably from the high heat), the motor began to make a horrible racket, and there was no longer any air coming through the hose. I contacted Revlon and was told that the licensing company is Helen of Troy. I was sorry to hear that since I intentionally did not purchase a Helen of Troy product. However, I was given very good service by the Helen of Troy Consumer Service Dept. I received a full refund of the purchase price as well as reimbursement of the shipping cost to return the product.",1
1,"I bought this product as I read it can be good for acne.  I have never had more acne in my life after using this product for a week!  Not sure if it works on wrinkles, but not good for acne.",1
1.0,DOES NOT WORK AT ALL!!,1
1,I will never buy a sally hansen product. Polish strips were dry and looked like white paper on the back of them. 5 boxes of this product in the trash.,1
2,We have used others and this is just not as good it clumps and does not fill as well as XFusion or Topix,1
1,I do love some of the Real Techniques brushes...this is just not one of them.  It is too round and large for my liking when applying blush or even powder.  I have a rather large face but I still prefer a smaller more dense brush.  I use the RT contour brush for cream blush and it works perfectly.  The smaller size keeps the blush high and on the apple of my cheek.  You can then buff it in by using a circular motion and blend it perfectly.  I have used the blush brush for powder as well but find the same problem.  It puts product all over and I prefer to place it it more precisely.  If it were more tapered it would be great but after washing it is too round.,1
2,After the first wash they began to unravel. They are so nice & soft but just started falling apart. Need to work on durability.,1
1,I believe the lip glosses I received were very old the coloring was faded.  I have been using this gloss forvyears ! Poor quality,1
1,Terrible. Unless the unit is full charged it jam's all the time. I oiled it and the same thing occurs. Maybe mine is defective because the corded one is amazing,1
2,"I had high hopes for this device but it broke upon second use.  I read a lot of reviews and watched videos on Youtube before purchasing and I wanted so badly to have and use and keep this tool but alas the glass wands are delicate.  In my case, the mushroom wand separated from it's metal base.  I was very careful in handling the wands and nontheless it broke.  I returned this item and won't buy another.<br /><br />Also the instruction booklet is highly non-informational. It was likely written in a foreign language and translated using an automated translation program which rendered this booklet as crazy incomprehensible. Don't rely on this instruction booklet for any help in knowing how to use the device.<br /><br />Go to youtube before you buy this and if you buy it watch the youtube videos before you use the device.",1
2.0,not what I had expected,1
1.0,"This lotion is really nice. I actually returned today to buy another bottle, but apparently the price has doubled (from $11 in mid April to around $24 in mid May). I would have been a repeat customer, but there's no way I'm paying that kind of increase. There are other great products out there.",1
1,"I bought the entire line of products from the Lisa's Hair Regimen on the Carol's daughter website. I took all the products back to Sephora yesterday. I used this Hair oil on my scalp and the next day my scalp started itching. I washed it that night and woke up the next morning in serious pain. I wear my hair natural and I had what felt like chemical burns all over my scalp. When I took the product back to Sephora the lady who sold it to me told me my scalp was RED w/ white spots all throughout it. I had to take OTC pain medication twice a day for three days just to help me sleep at night due to the pain. The only thing I can attribute it to is an allergic reaction. The product contain extracts from different types of plant and flowers. If you have allergies to these items I would suggest not using this product. I contacted Carol's Daughter and have not heard back from them yet. I would have expected more from the company who's product states 'Made with Love, Peace'.  <br />",1
1,"was poorly packaged product which caused it to break and bounced all content, pro please i need to know if you will be sent another or do I get my money back thanks",1
1,"There is no plumeria scent to this soap at all.  It actually smells fragrance-free.  Not that I care about the colour of soap, but the soap I received is more brown/brick red than pink as in picture.  Since scent and colour don't match description and photo I can't help but wonder if I was sent the wrong soap.  This soap has no plumeria scent, dry or wet.  :/",1
1,not good- no different than any other shaving product and the razor is also lousy. Very misleading expecially on the picture advertisements,1
2,"I have worn D&G's Light Blue for several years (always having bought it in a department store), so I'm very familiar with its scent and staying power on me.<br /><br />Amazon has clearly been supplied with a bad batch of this perfume, because my experience (twice!) was exactly like others who found that the Amazon product absolutely *does not* have the true scent or staying power of D&G Light Blue: it's a much lighter, far less complex scent, and it disappears almost immediately.<br /><br />I thought that the first bottle might have been a fluke, so I contacted Amazon by phone and they very kindly offered to send a replacement, with the assurance that if the replacement also was unacceptable, they would refund my purchase entirely.  (The perfume can't be returned due to postal regulations.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, the second bottle was just as bad as the first.  As promised, Amazon issued me a refund.  But the lesson here (for me at least) is that there's not a good way to bypass having to pay full price for this at the dept. store.<br /><br />So the product is terrible, but Amazon's customer service was fine, hence the 2 stars.",1
2,the color was not as expected.,1
2,The size was perfect but it doesn't do what is supposed to to instead it blows the dust all over the place is like I'm not even using it...,1
1,I didn't like the shadows at all ... I wouldn't recommend this to a friend ... The picture is different then in Person,1
1,"Do not use Splat hair dye! Just wrote this review on their Facebook wall...<br /><br />I will NEVER buy Splat hair color again! I usually color my hair a darker red but wanted to go a bit brighter so I bought the bright red box dye from Splat. I know how to dye my own hair; have been for years. Now my scalp, neck, and parts of my ears have splotches of bright red! Today I bought Color Oops to try and fix this mess and not even that could get all of this crap out! Everyone do yourself a favor and don't buy Splat! Better yet, go to the salon! I've learned my lesson! Now I have to walk around at work and in public with this mess on my head. Thanks for nothing Splat!",1
1,I bought this thinking it would work and did not notice any change what so ever. The only thing positive I can say is that it smelled nice.,1
2.0,"Very easy to apply, but last for only a couple to a few days.  It peels nail polish probable faster than just applying the nail polish itself.  I've tried it on different polishes - same results.<br /><br />Sally Hansen Xtreme Wear seems smaller, but the best for long wear so far.",1
1,"I had high hopes of liking this perfume, especially since Oprah raved about it and it is represented by SJP.  If you like a strong flowery smell (old lady) then you'll love this.  Definitely not for me.",1
1.0,"Love the product but the distributor i do NOT recommend. The bottle had a slice in it and had a faulty seal where the lid met the bottle, so conditioner came out from everywhere except the spout!",1
1.0,"This is a nice for a moisturizer but you can find that much cheaper in other products. I was hoping it would make a difference in wrinkles & crows feet but there is no difference what so ever after 2 weeks.  Update: The cream is gone, my wrinkles and crows feet are not! Very dissappointed, don't waste your $$$$$",1
1,"This used to be my number one beauty secret (the one in the gold can.) Now it is as hard and sticky as my great grandmother's setting spray -- designed to last a week without moving.  If you get stuck in the rain, Lord help you.  You have a 1980's hair gel mess.  I suppose I could use a smaller amount as a simple shiny hair spray, after all the nice shine is still there.  But that is not what my hair needs.  The old spray was excellent as a dry curl enhancer/refresher.  It worked well as a shine mist, and as a hair spray.  It was great on second-day hair too.  After my hair was dry I would turn it upside down, spray, scrunch, and bam!  Ready for Saturday night in 2 minutes flat.  I never needed another styling product.  Now I need 3 or 4.  FYI: I have Fine wavy (not curly) hair with damage from highlights.  Please bring it back, John Frieda.  I beg you!",1
2,It didn't really add much cushion.  It felt hard.  Gave it away,1
1,"I take reviews very seriously, and they have helped me make decisions on many products.  I ignored the 1 star for this product because it was just a commentary on the wax not fitting, not on the product itself.  Plus, the double version of this product had a 5 start review, so even though each had only 1 review I decided to buy this, in spite of the little voice in the back of my head telling me to wait for more reviews.<br /><br />Dumb move on my part.  I hope Amazon will refund my money.  In the meantime maybe I can save you some money and irritation.<br /><br />Here are the BAD things about this product: 1/ it says it comes with a wax cartridge, but it does not.  Good thing I bought extra wax refills.  2/It does not tell you that you have to purchase the paper separately- if you don't have the paper strips you cannot use this product.  3/The \\""instructions\\"" are written by someone who does not speak English- so they are garbled and confusing.  4/the wax is so sticky that the roller DOES NOT ROLL unless you press down really hard - no, I mean REALLY hard- to the extent that you are pulling your skin (painful if you are waxing your face) you are basically smearing wax, not rolling it.  5/there is nothing included to remove wax residue.  Good thing I had some of the oil from a Sally Hansen wax strip kit in my bathroom, otherwise I'd have wax all over my face and neck. Now I just have it all over the roller.  6/the roller is too wide for small spaces, you could not use it for brows or upper lip, it's more meant for arms and legs.<br /><br />What's good about this product?  Well the wax does work, I think it could strip chrome off a bumper.  But messy, painful, and useless if you have not purchased all the other components necessary to use this product.<br /><br />As I said, hope I can get a refund.",1
1,This does not fit my andis big detachable blades. They are too short.  Also they do. OT Fil my andis masters. I am very angry as I type this on my iPad. Total waste off time,1
2,There was nothing wrong with the shipment or the person I bought it from. It just sucks on the nails. It doesn't last for more than a couple of hours. Worst purchase,1
1.0,I had high hopes for this product but first of all right after I applied it I had a slight but definite burning sensation on my palate I don't get with poligrip or fixodent. That passed but it makes me wonder if the ingredients are safe. Secondly it started to loosen after an hour and I hadn't eaten anything too hard I may have only been drinking. Now I suspect my upper isn't fitting that well but nevertheless it loosened faster than the other denture creams do and by the time I got home it fell out completely. This was less than three hours after applying the paste.  I am NOT pleased.,1
1,This soap doesn't lather very difficult to use. I wouldn't recommend it. It's a very hard shape as well with sharp pointed corners etc.. It obvious that the manufacturer didn't do any homework before releasing this product just mixed up a batch dumped it in a mold and &#34; here you go&#34;.,1
1,I ordered this from  and had a strong burning sensation in my mouth  when using it.  I called nicorette who told me it was a counterfeit product. I am disgusted at this happening.,1

1,I am on day 29 using the entire ProX line and the only difference is that now I have breakouts and black heads.,1
2,Does not keep the curl tight. Not good for ringlets. When pulling out of curler it breaks the curl's stiffness.,1
1.0,This is WAY WAY WAY overpriced! Taking advantage of people who really love LOVE this wonderful fragrance. SHAME on you!,1
2,"oily residue just like basic rogaine, hate that oily feeling. went back to spectral dnc",1
2.0,"It is IMPERATIVE that you DON'T leave the trays in the cup of hot water longer than instructed--not one second more. This is to make them flexible enough to mold them to your teeth prior to first-time use. Unfortunately, I held mine in the hot water too long because its shape completely collapsed and it stuck to itself rendering it unusable. I tried to put the gel on my teeth and holding my lips apart but you don't want to know about that.<br /><br />I'm sure this is a fine product. And mostly due to my own errors, this product did not work for me and was money down the drain. Also does the company HAVE to use syringes to apply the gel? That's kind of intimidating. Wouldn't a tube work just as well?",1
1,"I liked the scent. It's what I remember from the 1960's. But it only lasts about 30 minutes (the original lasted all day). This is NOT the original cologne we thought we were buying. This is a watered-down version labeled as &#34;after shave' (which explains why it doesn't last on the skin). ALL these 'Canoe by Dana' products are now labeled as  'aftershaves', 'toilet splash', &#34;EDT' or &#34;Eau de Canoe...&#34; (which means 'water of Canoe' in French). You have to read the box's small print!! So, they all smell like the original. But, the original can't be purchased ANYWHERE. It doesn't exit. Just these watered-down versions.",1

So, went out and bought the same product again from a department store and tried the Discounts Jungle product and the department store one side-by-side. Nothing compare.",1

2,"Not too crazy about this.  It's not as universal as it seems - the hoodie would be a STRETCH as a style... literally.

1,"At first, I was impressed by this hair. However, after I put it in, it got tangled and no matter how much you comb it, it still gets tangled. It is such a pain wearing this hair because of the tangles and the bottom of the hair gets frizzy. I am very disappointed!",1

1,"Product was ok for the first few nights. But it does not last. The material stretches and loses elasticity very quickly. I found that after just a few uses, I had to tighten it more and more.

1,"I purchased it and didn't get a chance to open it until after the return policy window expired. It will not charge whatsoever. I was able to utilize it for a few days on the initial charge, but now it will not retain any charge. Not sure if its a bad cord, or trimmer.",1

1,"I have been using the REAL chandrika soap for a long time. The ingredients are coconut oil, wild ginger, lime peel oil, hydnocarpus oil, orange oil, and sandalwood oil.<br /><br />The soap Amazon sold me is NOT the REAL chandrika. The box is NOT the one pictured. On further investigation the OFFICIAL chandrika website shows the box I am familiar with, the one pictured. There is no reference to the \\""new style\\"". Furthermore both of the boxes list the manufacturers being in different states. The authentic manufacturer is in Kerala. This \\""new\\"" soap comes from Mysore. The manufacturer of the knock off is WIPRO, they have their own website. I suspect that Chandrika is a common scent such as nag champa is in incense. Perhaps there are many manufacturers.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that the knock off has lots of ingredients not found in the original that are undesirable such as water, talc, paraffin wax etc. The reason I originally liked chandrika was the short list of healthy ingredients. I am trying to reduce the use of chemicals in my life.<br /><br />Amazon needs to do more research when they source products.

1,"I totaly agree with the negitive review. If your hair is anything less than 10&quot; long, your results will not only dissapoint you, but might really make you mad. I purchased the revostyler as soon as I saw it at Target. I have used it- not only on my self, but on a few of my friends. All of our hair was straighter,yes. But at the same time, frizzy. While you blow dry your hair, you push up the loose, shorter hairs. This results in fly aways. If you use styling products the flyaways are not so bad. But I thought I was buying this to reduce the use of gels and hair spray!",1
1,"Great in theory but not in execution.  Product goes on very thick and difficult to control but the led light seemed to cure it &#34;enough&#34; (it always felt slightly damp afterwards, even with 2 sessions on the light) however,<br /><br />IT PEELS off like the kiddo nail polish after just hours of use. I painted my nails that morning, didn't do anything special and by that evening I lost the coloring do to completely coming off or badly peeling on all but THREE fingers.

It works better. Trust me! You are only paying for names with these products.",1
1,"Got this when my daughter said she wanted her dark blond hair to be brunette (it became a lovely chestnut color), then 2 days later she wanted it darker (it became a very dark brunette).  Then changed her mind again and wanted it all out, so with a tearful adolescent in tow, I got this right before the drugstore closed.  It was amazing: ALL the dye seemed to wash out, leaving her hair an appealing strawberry blond, lighter than her natural color.  But now ALL THE COLOR IS BACK! It doesn't look like we used ANYTHING AT ALL.  \\""Can that happen?\\"" I asked myself, but I see from other reviews that it can and does.  Truly weird, and a complete waste of money.",1
2,"Decent enough brush... one of the better ones for extra soft bristles, but the tongue and cheek cleaner is abrasive.  It catches on the sides of your mouth and the edges of your lips while you are brushing.  We already clean our tongue with the brush, leave the gimmicks out of it.",1

When the shaver did work, I think that the shave was not close enough; I was expecting it to be much closer - more like a blade and less like I shaved 12 hours ago. Anyway, when placed in the charging cradle. the shaver doesn't charge anymore. I replaced the cradle as well as the cord to no avail - the shaver still refuses to recharge.

BUT when i used this product it gave no coverage and it made me oily. It definitely didnt live up to its claims. Maybe I need to try the Intense Classic or the Hot Pink bb creams, but this one was a fail for me. The only positive I can say is that my skin did feel smooth when i used it.",1

2.0,The color looks pretty good when you spray it but it didn't last too long on my daughter. She's little so I'm thinking it may have been due to her being so active. But after just an hour and a half it was already unnoticeable. I expected it to last longer because of the price.,1

1,thought would go high enough to do a mani and pedi both...quality was cheap!!,1
1,"So I was recommended to try this in order to get the Taylor Swift curls and I thought for the price why not try it. Well let me save you a Jackson ($20)....do not get this. First off the little holder does hold our hair especially if it is thin or you have layered hair. Also it is not easy to wrap it around the spirals. It says it is easier to follow and it is not. Also the top of the iron does not have a finished surface. Stray pieces of hair get stuck at the top and when you unroll the iron it pull out those stray hairs. Also it does not curl it well. Lastly, forget the little stand that is comes with. It falls over. This could cause a fire hazard! Seriously invest in a good flat iron. You can curl and straighten your hair.",1
2,"I agree with another reviewer that this is not the original to anything I have used in the past by Phytomer.  I too was looking for what I used to buy several years ago; this isn't it.  This has a scent and feels heavy on my face.  It doesn't feel like it soaks into my skin, rather it feels like it coats the surface.  Also, it took quite a while to arrive, when it did it had gone through customs and came from Sweden.",1
2,"Short answer: Get something else, this is the \\""Sharper Image\\"" version of a beard trimmer, flashy but ultimately useless.<br /><br />Long answer: Get something else.  You don't need a backlit LCD display with capacitive buttons and a motorized guard to cut your beard, especially when the performance of the cut is no better than your average 10-20 dollar beard trimmer, assuming the battery even lasts through a whole trime.  3-motor speeds might be useful somehow (probably just there to improve the poor battery life), but I can't imagine not just using it on high the whole time.<br /><br />The only unique thing about this that might be useful to someone who travels a lot is it charges through a standard mini-USB port, like most modern (non-apple) smartphones, so that's one less special charger to carry with you.  I think it'd make more sense to get a simpler trimmer with a much stronger battery.<br /><br />In other words: get something else.",1
1,"It didn't work like I thought it would.  I thought it might just be my hair (I have thick, wavy hair) so my daughter tried it too.  No improvement for either of us.  Very disappointing...the commercials made it look so impressive like our hair would be shiny and soft...",1
2,"I have been a big fan of the color tattoo series. I have the taupe, which is awesome. It covers well, blends well, and dries to a smudge-proof, wrinkle-proof finish.<br /><br />But this one, the shady shores, has a dark dried out ring around the edges, and the middle is TOO slippery/soft and doesn't dry right, just kinda slides around as you try to spread it, and wears off quickly because it's not drying right. Maybe I got a bad one or something. I was hoping for a lighter color version of what I already had, but the consistency is just totally different.",1
1,"One star because this product seems to be no longer available!  I have bought it before without difficulty but now it seems impossible to obtain.

The advertisement should be withdrawn unless this product again becomes available.",1

When I tried to use them 3 of them were dried up, 4 other bottles the brush was messed up you couldn't make a line because the brush was all over the place instead of a straight line. This was a big disappointment. I just pitched in the garbage it will coast more to send them back then what I payed for them. Well I know not to purchase from Amuse. Not a happy person.",1
1,Bought Premier Dead Sea cream and salt while on vacation.  Searched for Biox Thermal Beauty Mask and found it on Amazon.ca.<br />The price was amazing compared to other sites.  Will buy more products.,1
1,I love the comb brush applicator but I wish its available in waterproof formula. Waterproof formula is the only kind that will hold the curl of my lashes. Non-waterproof formula just weighs my lashes down and removes the curl from my lashes instantly right after I apply it.,1
1,"I had not been happy with old clippers so I thought I would order a good pair.  Well, these were not the ones.  Ok for nails but I wanted it for skin too.",1
1,I have ordered conditioner and got shampoo. VERY unhappy.,1
2,These are kind of cool when you put them on but they lasted for about 10 minutes. Any water or sweat or anything will make these come off. So if you want something that is very temproary these are for you.,1
1,Not what I expected!! Came in an open package inside the mailing envelope and was in pieces!! Was going to return but didn't want to deal with the hassle!!,1
2,My daughter liked it at first but then after 10 min was bored with it.  You also can hardly fit everything into the little case.,1
2,"I was hoping it would help with my itching, flaklng, and inflamed scalp. Half way thru the bottle, no difference noted as yet.",1
2,This serum does not help your skin brightening.  It is bad luck when I buy it.  Do not buy it again.,1
2,"I bought this perfume based on other rave reviews.  Let me just clarify, I'm not a perfume snob but I do expect the perfume to: 1) smell good and 2) last for at least 2 hours.<br /><br />This perfume failed the test.  While it smells fresh and floral (with a hint of spice) the scent disappears after 15 minutes.  For some, that may suit them perfectly.  But for me, in the hot humid summer, I need something stronger and that will last so that I can at least smell fresh even if I don't feel like it.<br /><br />It's fine if you plan to stay home and can re-spritz, but I won't be buying it again.",1
1,Look very unrealistic compared to other Hairdo products.  Not for me.  Didn't fit well and would need to be trimmed to fit even partially.,1
2,"I was disappointed with this serum. I purchased it at a reduced price in return for an unbiased evaluation.  It doesn't have the texture that i have had with other serums, drys quickly on my hand so I have to use more just to get it on my face.  I haven't noticed any change to my skin but to be honest I have only been using it for a week.  Definitely need to use with a moisturizer.",1
1,"I can't really say if the product works or not. When I received the box, the seal was broken. I didn't think that was such a big deal. I figured it could have broken in transit. When I opened the box it looked like everything had been thrown in there, and there were no instructions. I was too leary to try it. It looked like a return that no one checked. I was apprehensive about using it and worried about product tampering, so I returned it. The return was painless.",1
1,"I ordered a four pack of the product [Clean & Clear Cooling Daily Pore Toner, 8 oz (Pack of 4)], and received only one! The product was filled to the top.

1,"I bought this at the salon I got my hair cut at thinking this would add shine and hydration to my naturally curly thirst 3B/3C hair.  It worked really well the first three days I used this but I noticed my hair felt coated, almost like  plastic was wrapped around my hair shaft.  Then by the second week I used it my hair was really dried out and really frizzy and it had been the MO Hydrating cream that was damaging my hair.  I attribute it to the \\""cones\\"" that are in it because the cetyl alcohol I don't think would dry my hair as bad as it did but this product was really disappointing.  I had tried the shampoo and conditioner, the curl cream and even the oil and all of the products have been over priced and have left me disappointed.  Save your money on this because this has no properties as a leave-in conditioner at all.  It's more or less just a cream based-lotion and you're better off with some cheapie drug store brand.  Just look at the ingredients list.  The first four ingredients are not even natural and will damage your hair so stick to something else.  And they're not even water soluable.  Yikes!",1

1,"My best advice-Keep your receipt! This product has a money back guarantee and is returnable for a refund from any store including Amazon. This product is the thickest, cakiest, driest product I have ever tried. I used the smallest amount possible and it went on crumbly and flaky. I tried it again with more product and, it was a caked on mess. Reminded me of theatre makeup we used in college, and the maximum coverage paste from Merle Norman, which does have its place for unusual skin problems. No, I did not use a primer or spackle first. Perhaps with a silicone base under it.....I don't know anything about Bzz agents, but I do hope those who didn't like the product are free to say so, just like all those who did like it, who wrote reviews here. I have been using Bare Minerals for a few years and just a touch, and I mean TOUCH of that covers all my flaws with no caking, streaking or build-up.

I've gotten so many split ends because of this, it's ridiculous. Even if your hair is a bit wet, it tends to damage ur ends really bad and flips ur hair in the wrong direction. I'm so disappointed and to top it off, I have burned myself with this styler, Its completely dangerous! Ive gone back to my hair straigthener and I see better results with a Target straightener than with a tv styler.",1

1,This did nothing! The brissels hardly moved! It wasn't worth the purchase.,1
2,"Because of the quality, I chose 2 stars. I'd probably pick 2.5 if it were an option. I have very thick, just past shoulder length hair, and it took most of the rollers to get it all up. First thing I notice is there aren't enough large, pink rollers and the blue ones are superfluous unless you want a really tight perm-y curl. I managed to avoid using those, but did have to use quite a few yellows, and those came out looking kinda ratty and caused tangles because of the little curls being underneath and random. So, that's not what you want. But the curls from the larger sized rollers came out very nicely, and created some nice lift. My hair has always taken and held curl well, so if your hair is more resistant to curl then maybe don't take my word for it. The rollers also kept breaking while I was putting it up, so it took probably twice as long as it should have. I have never had that issue with even cheaper rollers in the past. So, to sum up, poor quality rollers, pretty good hair.",1

I THOUGHT IS WOULD BE GREAT WHERAS THE OTHER REVIEWS WERE GOOD BUT IM NOT AT ALL HAPPY WITH IT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SO I ORDERED TWO ONE TO GIVE AWAY BUT ID BE WAY TO EMBERISSED TO GIVE IT AS A GIFT. IM SORRY TO SAY BUT I DONT THINK IT IS WORTH WHAT I PAID FOR IT!,1
2,works alright but could do with out,1
1,"This product is not like the Clarisonic heads.  The bristles are rigid and feel way too abrasive.  While using it, it causes tiny splashes of your cleanser, which will get in your eyes if you're not careful.  Really uncomfortable to use.  I threw them away and ordered the real thing from Clarisonic.",1

2,"I bought this face wash because I was looking for organic, natural ingredients.  The first time I used it, I noticed my skin tingled a bit.  The next time it stung. Just because it is natural, don't assume, as I did, that it is mild.  It is very acidic/astringent.  I ended up having to pour it down the drain.  It was too strong for my skin and I don't think I have sensitive skin.  It's not a bad product.  It's just not for everyone.",1
2,"I have this exact Hot Air Kit from the 90's.  It worked wonderfully till I overheated it.  The new model has an opening on both the brushes where they connect to the handle.  This causes alot of the hot air to escape there and not make it to the actual barrel part.  I found it still works, but I have to use on high to make sure it gets the flow of air all the way through the barrel.  Just hope it doesn't overheat using it like this....keeping my fingers crossed.<br />The purchase was wonderful.  I received it 2 days earlier than expected, which was great because I was having many bad hair days LOL.",1
1,I would not recommend this,1
1,"Honeybee Gardens has created a limited range of colors. Particularly their pinks which, when they arrive, are actually varying shades of pink and PURPLE!<br /><br />While perhaps healthy, they don't come off with rubbing alcohol, as advertised. In fact, they won't come off AT ALL with ANY PRODUCT, including regular nail polish remover. I've had to resort to using a buffing bar to remove the polish manually. This won't work for each wear as I won't have any nails left in a month!<br /><br />How ridiculous is it to create (and falsely advertise) a product which doesn't do what it says and won't remove in the method described???? While I suspect they have updated the formula, since some of these reviews complain about chipping and mine didn't chip at all and actually wore very well, now it won't come off. Sure, I can now purchase their \\""special\\"" polish remover hoping they are now honestly advertising the product, but do I really want to spend more money on them and believe in their \\""truth in advertising\\"".<br /><br />The woman who owns Honeybee Gardens appears to be a great marketer...but less so as an actual business woman.",1

2,"When first purchasing this product I was extremely excited about the wonderfully glamorous effects it would have on my clearly &#34;not so pink&#34; labia.

When I spoke with a Eucurin product representative by phone today she stated that they briefly made it  UVA and UVB effective and due to complaints re product consistently they returned to UVA protective only.",1
2,I use Rosehip Oil from my local health food store and it is very moisturizing and works well to remove makeup and as a carrier oil for other products.  I saw this product on Amazon and decided to try it.  I'm not sure what the difference is with this product compared to the product I buy locally but this oil makes my eyes water.  Even when I don't use it around my eyes but just on the rest of my face - my eyes will water.  I must be allergic to something in this particular brand.  So I'll stick with the local brand as it works with no adverse reaction.<br /><br />The seller of this product has a great response and personally contacted me with e-mail - not a form e-mail but specific to me.  This was a nice touch.  I would purchase from this company again.,1
1,"I only used the product itself once, it left my hair FEELING nice, but I got an instant headache from the scent.  A few of the other reviewers noted how the scent stays with you all day long. They were right.  I initially thought that I would like the scent because I usually like the smell of mint, and I also like the smell of lavender.    I however, never thought about the two smells combined.  It isn't EXACTLY like patchouli, but WAY too close for my comfort!",1
2.0,"I have used this product for several years, but have purchased it from local retailers until now. Product should need to be squeezed from the tube, creating a thick cream. The tube I received through Amazon is faulty in that the product runs out of the tube -it is that thin.  Date shows it isn't old, so have they watered it down? I'll never buy this type of product online again.",1
1,for people with long hair it is much to complicated to get on and takes way to long. By the time I got it on my hair was alomost dry. Definatly not worth it for people with long or thick hair. Would not buy again!!!,1
2,"I bought this a month ago. First off, I thought the jar was quite small for the price and the jar I received must have been in some type of heat becuase all the product was on one side of the jar. I used it faithfully for about one month now(began using it on the 6th today is the 2nd and the jar is gone.) yes it ran out fairly quickly and since I didnt even see slight results on my very red stretch marks so im skeptical to buy another jar given the price and the fact that it might be a big waste of my money. I gave it two stars becuase it did seem very moisturizing and smelled good. Idk maybe ill purchase again when I get my next check and see what happens. I really got my hopes up and didnt get quick results like other reviews had said.",1
2.0,It's okay.  I don't like how my skin feels after using it.,1

1,"I work as an actress , i used to buy many of hair extentions , My experience with this Total Beauty Store was a Totaly Bad one , Their customer service is not professional at all , First I ordered 2 bleach color extentions ( Part of different colors order ), they sent me only one & they charged me for the two , the one sent was Very Dry & Not fresh at all, They sent me another color called Ash as an alternative for the second bleach saying in an attached written note that i can exchange it later , that's how they take the decision for the client , i contacted their customer service saying i can't exchange it as im living in Egypt & I receive my stuff via shipping office address, they said they will send me the missing items & since then ( Almost 2 months ) they sent nothing & they do not even care to answer my several e-mails , Very poor Hair Extensions , Very poor Customer Service . Regret every penny spent with this Rubbish",1
2,This product did not leave my hair feeling soft or looking polished and the smell reminded me of lip smackers or some type of lip balm which I am not a fan of maybe some of you are.  I did not smell mango or the colada and the $5 shipping for a $5 product was not a deal but I wanted to try the product.,1
1,"Okay, I am not a regular tanner. I usually use tan wipes or go into the salon for a spray.<br /><br />With that said, this was a COMPLETE mess. I'm not sure I got a product that works or what happened.<br /><br />The mitt has two sides - a brown side and a white side. I read the directions twice. It says to use the soft side which I assumed was the brown side. I used the product on the brown side and ended up with completely brown fingers. Both sides have no lining. I didn't have gloves on hand and so I then tried to use a small zip-lock type baggie under the mitt. This allowed my hands not to be covered in product but I had a hard time keeping the mitt on with a baggie.<br /><br />I must not have gotten a working product. The product was complete liquid. Every time I turned over, the cap sprayed everywhere. I had to then wipe down my bathroom. By the time I had covered just my legs, 10 minutes had passed. I then proceeded to turn over the product & put it on the mitt and it took forever.<br /><br />I think I was sent a product that was missing the spray. I see a spray cap in the photo but I didn't receive one. Mine had just a regular cap like a shampoo/conditioner product. You had to turn it over and dump it on the mitt.<br /><br />My body took 30 minutes and was a streaky mess. I kept trying to rub it in but it would dry so quickly and the mitt kept absorbing more and more of the product.<br /><br />After the 30 minutes it took to cover my body the bathroom was a mess. I had used about 1/2 the product or more and I was totally brown - like I had spent a month in the Cancun sun without sun block. I looked awful.

I then had to clean the bathroom walls, wipe down everything and wash my bathroom rug.<br /><br />I am hoping I don't wind up with brown/orange fingers since they were soaked before I  used the baggy.<br /><br />How is this a 5-star product?

2,Product ok  not for me. I found better,1
1,Umm....<br /><br />I received this a padded envelope.  When I opened the envelope the top had clearly been damaged in shipping and the envelope was full of lube.  That was not such a big deal until I inspected the damaged cap a bit and saw that it had a pubic hair somehow threaded through the crack and out the top hold of the cap where the lube is supposed to come out.<br /><br />So how is it that a NEW product that is intended for internal use does NOT have a safety seal and somehow has a hair inside the product?<br /><br />WTF?<br /><br />This is so disgusting that I will not be doing business with this supplier any longer.<br /><br />Best part:  It's been over a week and no one responds to my emails for a return/refund.<br /><br />Great company.<br /><br />Stay the heck away from these guys.,1
2.0,The color looks nothing like the picture. The bottom layer is red rather than magenta/dark pink.,1
1,"The Schwarzkopf Color Save Silver Shampoo - I researched a variety of brands and this one stood out on the reviews. First of all, there are no directions about how long to leave it in my hair. Secondly, it doesn't work. I have tried leaving it in 1-2 minutes and then 5 minutes. Same results, my hair is just as golden as before when I didn't use it. Nothing happens. I am very disappointed.  I didn't hear a peep from customer service.",1
2,It is a very sweet vanilla smell.  It's too sweet for me but my 20 year old daughter likes it.,1
1,Hair dryer is ok but the attachments are snap on and do not click in. The hair straightening attachment falls off  due to it getting so hot. A little annoying but it does the job. The hair dryer is light weight which is nice. This is not meant for people who straighten their hair often.,1
2,"I bought this because I have several Loreal HIP Duos that I love, but the pink color in this one just does not show up, no matter how I apply it. It looks pretty when my eye is closed, but the color is not intense enough to show up when my eyes are open. If you need the brown, go with Forgiving (which comes with a terrific peacock blue).<br /><br />As for the shadow itself, it's terrific. Very nice blending and feathering. Holds up well with a primer, such as Urban Decay Primer Potion. A less expensive way to add some pizazz to your makeup look.",1

1.0,"I saw sooooooo many people talk about this product, and it does nothing to my teeth. Super disappointed!",1

2,"Relax everybody, I got this kit and used it over the last three days. It was NOT anything to write home about, no big change in texture and it wasn't any softer using this as opposed to my drugstore stuff. Keep moving ladies, no miracles here.",1
2,"The concealer is a lot lighter in the picture than in hand. I thought it would be a little light for my skin from the photo, but it's actually much darker. I can't even wear it without it making my skin look orange. I also found that other than being the wrong shade, it doesn't do much for covering up, even with a foundation on top.",1
2,I was very happy in the beginning when I got this. I used to have the more basic models that stopped working after 2 years. But I am disappointed with this one. Less than a year it is not running well anymore. It runs out of battery so fast and has slowed down spinning.,1
1,"I don't know who they're trying to fool, but the wig they sent me looks NOTHING like that picture and is very unflattering.",1
1.0,"I really, really loved this product. The smell is incredible, the ingredients are safe, and it lasted. That's the biggest part--it lasted. Do you realize how amazing it is to find an all-natural deodorant that doesn't leave you smelling like a pubescent boy after just a few hours? It isn't as easy to put on as a traditional stick or spray, but it was well worth it.<br /><br />However, my love was soon shattered. I rarely react to anything, and if I do my skin/body usually adjusts fairly quickly. That wasn't the case here. After just a few days I realized my underarms were turning red. Unpleasantly red. Rash red. I had to switch back to my old stuff.<br /><br />If anyone has any tips for this, I would love to hear them. I am still experimenting every few days to see if I can make it work... like I said, I really did love this stuff.<br /><br />EDIT 05/19: I've tried. I've really, really tried. I cannot find any way to use it without getting a rash. It doesn't hurt, but my entire underarms turn bright red and it lasts for days. Such a beautiful jar and I love the smell... and now I have to throw it away with barely any of it used. I hate doing this more than I can say.",1

2,"I'm not impressed.  It does not moisturize any better than Ivory soap, and it makes an unsightly mess in the shower.  Granted, I don't have any major skin conditions; it is relieves itching for those who do it's probably worth it.  If you're looking for a luxury soap for normal skin, this is probably not for you.",1
1,"This no no thing is aweful if you want to remove hair permanently. I have had electrolysis and laser hair removal for over 20 years. I have PCOS and the side effects are facial hair so I will never be hair free. I bought this hoping it would work between sessions at the doctors office and it does not. The only way to stun the growth of hair is by killing the ROOT. All this thing does is burn the hair on the surface. It seems like it works because you smell the hair burning and see a light pulse which makes it seem like its getting deeper but it isnt. This is exactly the same as shaving. All you are doing is removing the surface hair and not getting the root below the skin. Depending on how fast your hair grows, all people are different, you will see the hair come right back. Do not waste your money if you want any coarse, dark hair gone for good.<br />Tip: Shaving does not make your hair thicker or darker. Shaving does the same thing. It removes the hair from the surface. It does nothing to the root which is the only way that changes the appearance and texture of the hair. Hence, waxing and plucking will.",1
2,"I've been purchasing this lotion for several years now, but was so disappointed to use it.  The lavender scent is overwhelmed by some other scent which is not pleasing to me.  I wrote to find out why and never received a response.  Will not be buying it again and will dispose of the bottle.",1
1,I have purchased 2 of this item and both only lasted about four weeks. The concept great mixes great but does not last.  Can't afford to buy new one every month at 25 bucks,1
1,I got this item a month or so ago and I was excited to start using it despite the mixed reviews. I have had problems with acne off and on for years. I've tried expensive products like Proactiv and Murad and I've seen a dermatologist on numerous occasions. When the protocol kit arrived I started using it immediately and was very happy with the results. My skin was softer and it cleared up pretty quickly. Best of all I didn't think it had any nasty chemical smell like so many acne products do. About two weeks ago however I noticed some small breakouts but attributed it to my monthly cycle. A week later the breakout was still there and it was getting worse. In addition my skin had become very oily looking. I continued to use the product morning and night as per the instructions but my skin has not improved at all and I've decided to stop using it - in fact I threw the remainder of the bottles in the trash this morning. Bottom line - I wouldn't buy this item again and I feel like I've wasted $30. Back to Neutrogena I go.,1
1,"Very expensive, and it is not effective at all.  Sorry I fell for the hype,",1
2,"This was the second flat iron that I have ever bought in my life so I was really thrilled about using it. My first was the CHI which I was slightly disappointed in so I gave that one away. Anyway, I was introduced to Royale at a mall by a vender. She used it on my hair and I loved the results so I bought the whole line of products that she offered which included two flat irons (big and small), shampoo, conditioner, and the Royale serum. I felt like the Serum was a little different than the one the lady used on my head at the mall, but nevertheless it made my hair smooth. After using my flat iron for 9months it stopped working. I have tried to call customer service but I dont get any help. I am very mad about this and will never buy another Royale ever!! Also because its so hot, which i did kinda like, it dried out my hair and caused it to be brittle. Would I recommend this, maybe or maybe not, all I have to say is \\""Buyer beware!\\""",1
1,"I have been wearing tendre poison for years and I love it! I was so excited to find it again. When I got the 3/4 full bottle for over $60, it was not the same scent.

2,"I too was mistaken. No where in the description did it say this is for tanning beds or possibly outside(?). I thought it was a self-tanner as I don't go tanning in salons.

It does smells a little like cigarettes. I kept wondering where do I smell smoke but it was me!",1
2,I have started using gel nail polish because well its just cheaper for me to do it ! lol I saw harmony has lots of pretty colors and was looking for a color similar to Essie's ballet slippers. I decided to choose Snow Bunny. When I polished my nails the nail polish was so thick(comparable to other name brand gel polish I have used before). The color also streaked. I am just not happy with this color. I ordered another color same name brand and I am hoping the polish isn't as thick as this one.,1
1,"I read all the reviews and advice. I presoaked my feet and followed the directions. I soaked my feet every other night for the following week, but I never got any real skin falling off.

I should have lit the $20 on fire instead.",1
1.0,"Is the worst product I ever bought on amazon, not looking for anything like the images of samples. the most serious is that I bought several and I felt cheated when opening the package.

2,"I am always trying to find shaving products to give me a closer and more comfortable shave.  I've experimented with this razor for the past few days.  I will not be permanently upgrading to this.  For some reason, Gillette appears to have completely bought into the notion that five blades gives a better shave than just two or three.  Like the Fusion Power, the Fusion Proglide Power has some of the same problems.  The most obvious problem it has is cost (just like the Fusion Power).  For the quality of the shave you get, the cost of replacement cartridges is not justified.  To be fair, I have noticed a slightly more comfortable glide with this over the Fusion Power.  The blade stabilizer and microcombs do appear to be a modest improvement in this regard.  Also, the Fusion Proglide blades appear to last a little longer than the Fusion Power blades - but not by much.  The micropulses still do not provide a greater degree of comfort over a razor that lacks this feature.  Also, I have not noticed a closer shave with this razor over the current one I am using (which is now the Schick Hydro 3).  When comparing it my current razor, the Fusion Proglide Power definitely lacks the level of smoothness and comfort.  Last but not least, just like its predecessor, I've discovered this five bladed razor tends to nick my face more often than a double or triple bladed razor.  Gillette needs to get back to basics by realizing it is much easier to keep a satisfied customer who gets a good, comfortable shave as opposed to introducing new brands of razors that have gimmicks, and that are, not to mention, ridiculously overpriced.",1

1,"I've got thin, fine, wavy/curly hair and this product is just way too heavy for me. For years I have mixed gel with a leave in conditioner and thought this would be a similar concept but it seems to never really dry and leaves my hair looking crunchy and over-gelled, no matter how little I use. It also smells disgusting. I know a lot of people love the smell of these products and I actually got compliments on the smell the few times I tried to use this, but to me it smells like plastic and rotting fruit. It makes me nauseous. I was aware of the Garnier fragrance when buying this and knew I didn't like it, but I didn't expect to be walking around in a cloud of it all day long because most hair products aren't as strongly fragranced as this one.

The pigment in it does not seem to stick to any kind of material, really. It certainly does not stick to brown or white hair.

Nevertheless, I have a suspicion that the people who see it &#34;freshen up&#34; their natural color may be perceiving an illusory correlation. After all, hair always looks refreshed, and the color looks more intense and interesting, after showering. As far as its cleaning function, the shampoo is fine. It has a slight cherry fragrance, produces a low-average amount of lather, rinses off easily, does not seem to be too drying, and does not seem to irritate too much.",1

1,I have been using sonicare for about 8 years so I know what I'm talking about. I believe these replacement heads are FAKE! They look the same at first but they didnt' fit onto my Soncare as easily as the others and the bristles are far too SOFT. There's no resistance on them at all so how can they clean your teeth!!!! I'm going to ask for my money back ASAP...,1
1,This does not work. And it smells awful.,1
1.0,Definitely wan NOT the shade they advertised,1
2,"Cheap looking in person. Color is fairly on target but size and hair volume is so small, won't look right.",1
1,"My husband bought one for me in January as my early birthday present, Used it 2 times if that and then it stopped working. SO I gave the product the benefit of the doubt and said maybe it was defected so I went and purchased another one, got half way done with my hair and it shut off never to turn on again. Thank goodness the representatives at Conair are understanding so they promised to replace it after I send a $5 money order and mail it back. I guess ill send it and hope for the best.",1
1,"over priced, did no know it had glitter in it.",1
1,Way more expensive than its original price on lushusa.com,1
1,Product I received - six cans - was garbage. All I got out of the can was a liquid stream which had little semblance to shaving cream. Total waste. I have written Gillette in an attempt to get replacement product I will let the community know how they respond.,1
1,Smells like bleach cleaning products(especially when you sweat). Too expensive to purchase again. Plus it doesn't do that great of a job.,1
1,"Missing parts, and parts that do work, do so just okay. My trimmer arriaved missing one of the the attachment, and the one that did come is not that strong.  I would avoid this product.",1
1,It will not cover my whole head and I have a small head. It does no good if the scarf won't cover my hair to protect it while I sleep.,1
2,it didn't solve my hair problem,1
1.0,One PAIR?!?! I received one earring not a pair and I waited almost a month to receive them which is understandable but not receiving one earring,1
1,Worked great the first 3 times I used it. Today at least 3 parts inside of  device came loose. I can hear the separated parts raddle. The device started overheating immediately and burned my face to the blood.,1
1,"So I bought FOUR MICRO TOUCH ONE razors because their was a huge sale going on and I was excited. This product reminded me of my grandfather and how he always used the same metal razor. So I gave one to my man and I gave another to my Dad. Then I kept two for myself because I didn't have anymore men in my life to give them to. I haven't even had them three months and I went to change the blades, not one, but BOTH of the razors twist handles to open the top part of the razor, were stuck! I could not turn either one to open them. How is that possible?! I'm not even strong enough to close them tight enough to not be able to open them again! I was so frustrated in my own strength, thinking I can't possibly be this weak that I decided to use my teeth. Big mistake. Now I have TWO chipped teeth. Thanks Micro Touch. I thought I'd finally have a razor I would not have to throw away every week. I was very wrong. I'm so disappointed.",1
1,"It seems that the product that we received was not the authentic Crew product, but instead a counterfeit product.  The bottle shape was unusual and the smell of the product was not the same as the usual.  Unfortunately I did not realize this in time to return the product to Amazon...my return period had lapsed.  Please do not buy this product.",1
1,This product sucks it's nothing like what I expected it's deceiving don't buy,1
2.0,I was highly allergic to this product,1
1.0,This thing is terrible and dangerous!,1
2,If this gets in your eye it WILL sting alot. It is oily and leaves your face looking like you rubbed it over with vaseline. Not impressed. But seller did a good job in ensuring it arrived on time and looked as pictured.,1
2,"I've been wearing vanilla body oil for years and the company discontinued it.  So I've been searching for something to replace the warm, soft, NATURAL vanilla scent that I love.  This ain't it.  My biggest issue with this scent is that it's SO sweet.  I was almost nauseous just catching the occasional scent of it on me through-out the day.  It certainly lacks a natural vanilla scent and there's nothing soft and warm about it.",1
1.0,Works great as a lip liner.  Definitely not for the brow.  Too difficult to apply (not waxy enough?) and a terrible color.,1
1,Irritated and dried my lips.,1
1,"I was extremely excited to get this palette. But I was disappointed when I opened it.<br />They gave me the wrong palette. Honestly, it was not worth the cheap price.<br />But, I had to give them credit. It was unbroken, and arrived a day early.<br />I just wished they would have sent me the right palette.. not one that every color wasn't the same.. and the colors they gave me don't  go with my skin color or my eyes so I can't just settle with the wrong product they gave me.<br />I gave this 1 star.. I'm definitely disappointed.. wasted money.",1
1,"I have highlighted hair and it said \\""safe for color treated hair\\"", but it has harsh ingredients never recommended for colored or highlighted hair. After shipping and returning costs, I am not even sure it's worth it to send it back....so don't make the same mistake I did.",1
2,Never really saw any change.,1
1,"i tried using mine twice both times it did the same thing, shut off after only 30 seconds to a minute of being on it is obviously faulty i would have returned it immediately but i had it for awhile before using it the first time, dont waste your money",1
1,"I still had some of the real eau de parfum left and when I compared the bottle and color of the liquid, it was suspect. The smell and its quickly fading aroma confirmed my suspicions. It's what I get for buying from the internet I guess.",1
1,This brush collapses when trying to brush my hair.  I would not recommend it for anyone that has thick hair.,1
1,"As soon as I opened the top to spritz some fragrance, the spritz thingy(broke the first day). Im assuming it was broken from the beginning. Now I just apply it like lotion. Overall, great smell. Won't be purchasing from this seller again.",1
1,"I was surprised at how shoddy this product was. I don't have much to say about the comb, it's just a cheap little piece of plastic, as expected. The scissors were a real disappointment though. I can't use them comfortably because the holes for your finger and thumb are so small. Also, the scissors don't open and close easily, you have to use too much pressure. I would advise spending a few dollars more to get something decent.",1
1,Great price. Poor cverage. Not happy. Luckly I did not pay a lot. Will not anymore. Cover girl need to work on product,1
1.0,"This is the first and last time I'll buy the new formula.<br /><br />I've used this product since the late 70s, but the new formula is drastically different. The old formula had orange roughy fish oil. I guess that got too costly so they replaced it with sticky, sticky glycerine. This cream isn't nearly as moisturising and does not last nearly as long.",1
1,This is cheap and looks nothing like the picture ... Please don't buy it ...,1
1,"Last In June 2009, I purchased this hairdryer. Today (9 months later) while drying my hair, sparks shot out of the dryer and there was fire. I threw the unit to the ground as I switched it off. This is not an electrical issue. I have a ground fault protection outlet sysetm in place. This is clearly a defective hairdryer. My 5 year old daughter was right there when this incident took place. I am so lucky that a fire did not start in my bathroom and especially grateful that my child was not harmed in any way. I am searching if there is a recall on this item and I am am contacting the company. This is  obviously a defective item that has no business being in my home. BUYER BEWARE OF THIS MODEL!",1
1,Pump would never work so never had the opportunity to try.,1
1,"The packing is absolutely endearing, especially with the unicorn on the top of the gloss. However, it gives off the illusion that it has more product in the gloss than it actually does. The gloss smells of strong vanilla. The application brush is stubby with hairs that are frayed, making it awkward to handle.<br /><br />The gloss itself is bright pink with minimal glitter but has an odd, sticky-and-gritty texture. The gloss also migrates. It certainly does not come off anywhere near as bright or glittery as the lips on the website have it displayed. The gloss has a horrific staining effect on lips that has to be viciously scrubbed off. Within an hour, the glossy effect from the product fades away and requires re-application for even color distribution within two hours.<br /><br />Will not buy again.",1
2.0,Save ur money just buy the gel heal things at walmart they will raise u a 1/4 inch.  They say that's the highest u should raise the interior anymore should be done to the outside/sole of the shoe.,1
1,"Given that my normal product (the regular voluminous lash mascara) was unavailable at the time, I decided to try the Million Lashes product.  Unfortunatelty this product doesn't even come close to comparing.  My lashes clump together, and somehow appear even shorter than they do when they're bare.  I will not even finish the tube.",1
1,I ordered the brush in the photo. But received a totally different one!  Very disappointed.,1
1.0,A high-quality duplicate . A waste of money since the fragrance washes away in minutes. I bought my last bottle from Fragonard.fr and loved it. Next time I will buy it from the french website even if shipping is a killer.,1
1,Either the formulation has changed or the product I received is a knock off.  I have ordered this product twice before and been very pleased with it.  This new bottle is not the same and I will not order again.,1
1,"Several years ago, I purchased the prior version of this device and loved it.  Small, easy transportable, easy to clean.  So, when it finally died, I bought the 360W without a moments hesitation.    Absolutely awful.  Where to start.  The prior version folded into a neat little package slightly larger than a deck of cards.  This thing is significantly larger, making it very difficult to pack.  Because its weird and bulky shape, it has twice caught the attention of airport security.  For the old unit, you shook it out, dried it with a paper towel and the world was beautiful.  In the 360W you cannot remove the water reserve to dry it.  I dread the thought of what is growing inside.      The prior unit had a very small nozzle on the end of a flexible cord that allowed easy maneuverability to hard to get places.  This thing is like moving a baseball bat around inside your mouth.  I have to travel periodically out of country so I was really amazed to discover that, unlike almost any other small personal appliance, the power connection was not dual voltage compliant.  Essentially useless in Europe or the middle east.    After about two months usage, the battery appears to be slowly dying.    Actively looking for something, ANYTHING, that will work as efficiently as the old water pic or, at least, better than this bulky, unsanitary clunker.",1
2,"I was very excited to order this product and time it came in, I applied the nail polish.  However I must say I'm highly confused as to why putting on a topcoat (Sally Hansen) made the polish change colors.  I applied the metallic pink and on one hand applied the topcoat and the pink is now fuschia.  So I now have one hand with metallic pink nail polish and the other with fuschia nail color.  The nail polish is not chip resistant as after the polish dried I went from my couch to my car and in a matter of 5 minutes, my polish chipped.  Will not be ordering this brand ever again",1
1,"I've loved pureology for years, but now they changed their shampoo formula and it's a mess! It doesn't lather and makes my hair all tangled in the shower. Very very disappointing.",1
1,"If you are buying this dryer because of the sensor feature, don't bother.  When the sensor is on, hair dryer is supposed to automatically shut off when you put it down.  Problem is, even the slightest tilt of the dryer while you are drying your hair, will cause the dryer to cut off. With the sensor on, it will take hours to get your hair dry because it is constantly cutting off.  It's an OK hairdryer with the sensor deactivated, but I've used better.",1
1,The Lipstick is stuck in lid and can not use,1
2,"I use this eyeliner brush with eyeshadows to line my top lashline and use the pushing method. This brush could be a lot better. It does have stiff bristles, which is needed for the pushing method of lining but the bristles are rough and hurt my eyes. I also tend to get fallout when using this brush so I don't find myself reaching for it much at all.",1
1,Less than two years of use and this thing just stopped working. Aggravating!,1
2,"After reading a lot of reviews I ordered this online, the color is okay.Not great actually dull. It's not moisturizing. Like mac's creme sheen or anything. I would not buy it again, for sure. My lips were so dry, and the product didn't last long. I've tried a lot of lipsticks. So far you get your moneys worth from MAC. And a few department store brands as well.",1
1.0,sent wrong product with no tea tree oil LAME,1
1,"Good morning, I am writing from Venezuela. Buy perfume Jean Paul, which came half. poorly packaged wine and poured almost the entire remaining product in half, which upset me a little. My English is written with Google translator because they do not speak English. Excuse me. Sincerely Aurea Rosas. I need to know how to do to fix this problem. Thank you very much ...  Note: It is in very bad taste to buy a product at that price and come in the middle of the bottle hope to respond to these words. Thank you.",1
2,"I used green cream level 6 for a very long time and was fairly happy with the results. This is a retinol night cream and should be used as such. With all that being said, the alcohol content in this product is very high and makes me think this product is a little on cheap the side. Yes alcohol can kill bacteria and is used in many products, but it is also an irritant for many people and some studies have shown it to increase the formation of wrinkles because of its drying properties. The consistency is also very thin, compared to most retinol formulas. This did help my acne, slightly, but the effects were minimal.",1
1,I ordered the ponytail elastic band shown in black.  They sent it in a bright red color--ugh!  My cost to return it to receive what I ordered.  Don't order this unless you like red!,1
1,I thought I was purchasing the  the complete head  as well that holds cutters.  I can purchase a new razor for the price Norelco charges for the holder and blades.,1
2.0,"This does nothing for me, I am really disappointed. I will not rebuy again.",1
1,"If you want a thin moisturizer that smells like grandma, this is for you. Don't get this if you want an alternative to harsh mosquito repellent; apparently Avon took that ingredient out and put it in another product.",1
2,"I got nail foils but not what is in the picture. I do not care for the wraps that I received they are too loud for me. I wanted what was in the picture. Yes the item was priced very reasonable, cheap even. I still expect to get what is in the picture. I am disappointed that I did not get what is in the picture.",1
1,I was so excited to buy this set in order to do nail art for my Halloween Party this year. I was practicing on myself and my mom and we were both disappointed when our valentine's day design started chipping within hours of painting our nails. Do not waste your money on this low quality crap.,1
1,I didnt receive the 30 colors I just receive 15 and I'm still asking them and nobody is answering me,1
2.0,Very cheap for the price paid.  Can get the same product elsewhere lots cheaper.,1
1,"I have severe acne, and I've tried everything from Proactiv to neutrogena. I decided to give this product a try because the reviews were great. I've been using it for almost two months now, and I am seeing no results, and my skin is actually getting worse (I don't think its from using the product, but my skin definitely isn't getting any better). Sigh, I wish my acne would stop getting worse and worse. :(",1
2,"I love this perfume and I would give it five stars, but the truth is they keep making it weaker and weaker. I can spray it on and walk to my car, by the time I get to my car, I can't smell it anymore! This is extremely sad because I love Ed Hardy's &#34;Hearts and Daggers&#34;. It was my favorite!!! I will also tell you that two years ago this was not the case, as it lasted at least half a day! No more Ed Hardy for me!!!! I will spend my $45.00 to $65.00 on something that lasts!!",1
2,"I have thick curly hair that I allow to air dry. This product lets my hair get frizzy when dry and looks too &#34;wet&#34; when wet. There is also an issue with excessive build-up. Ironically, the Sebastian Wet product, which is my favorite, does none of these things.",1
1,"This stuff does nothing but make your skin feel extra greasy, yuck! I tried to look up reviews on other sites and could not find any, that should have been a hint to not buy this junk. Waste of money for sure!!!",1
1,The idea is great but it's work is the worst i ever tried. not only wasting money but also tring using it is wasting time.,1
2.0,The product was not like the original.  They are too soft and do not do the job.  They look the same but are not!,1
1.0,Read all the reviews and still bought as a gift. Sorry to say it didn't work after multiple attempts and returned it.,1
1,I did not like this product at all...I used it twice and each time it made my clear hair feel dirty.,1
1,"Absolutely useless, worse waxing product I have ever bought (I bought the heat-in-a-pot version)<br />The wax doesn't come off with the strip, despite following instructions (I know how to wax) and obviously hardly any hair comes off; the strips rip half the time, too. You have to keep going at it, and it's painful from the first attempt - this coming from someone waxing for so long I barely feel it anymore. Obviously develops irritation as a result. So to recap: it is not effective, over-average painful rather than pain-free, and leaves damage - so much for what it promises! The only saving grace being that it rinses off with water - thankfully, since the wax doesn't come off.<br />Stay clear off this product.",1
1,"The bold red color in the larger image description does not in any way match the pallid washed out color of the lipstick that arrived.  While the lipstick that arrived is of a high quality, it was not what I understood I was ordering.",1
2,"the spray just comes out in a stream, not a true atomizer.  I would pass on this set for another model.",1
1,"This has a very poor design.  The hinge at the nose bridge is WAY to big and pokes you in the top of your nose when you wear these.  This is therefore VERY UNCOMFORTABLE, I can only see these being used as a torture device.  I've seen other folding glasses and the hinge is much smaller and is therefore much more comfortable to wear.  These are also difficult to fold back up, maybe a contortionist would appreciate it.  Again, by comparison I've found the design on other folding glasses to be very straight forward and simple to fold back up.  I can't comment on the reliability of these as I tossed them in the garbage shortly after receiving and trying these on.  I WOULD NOT recommend these to anyone.",1
2,Did the job but never really used Because it hurt my neck.,1
2,"The dotting side works perfectly fine, but the brush sucks! Definitely not worth almost $7.00. It does not clean excess polish very well because the hairs are too brittle. It's uneven, which means you cant paint tips because it does not clean up good. I think I would have rather paid a little more money for something better than this. Would not recommend.",1
1,"I cannot use this product. I am terribly allergic to the scent or some other ingredient in it. I bought the large size because I have loved the other products from Camille Beckman, but I have to throw this out. I got sinus headaches after using it.",1
1,I did not like the smell and I did not like the way it made my hair feel. No good.,1
2,I bought these for my husband to travel with.  He complained they hurt his face so I tried one out and it even hurt on my legs.  Wasn't impressed.,1
1,"I purchased this hair dryer from Amazon and used it for 5 minutes and the heating element went out and it only blew cold air.  I processed a return and got a second unit within a couple of days.  The second unit did EXACTLY the same thing.  Did not complete one drying before the heating element stopped.  This is a very poor quality dryer or a manufacturer with very poor quality control, either way I would never purchase another product from them.  Amazon has processed my return easily and quickly both times and I am now going to purchase another brand of professional dryer from Amazon.  Do not waste your money on this, other reviewers have had the same experience with the heating element not working.",1
1,"it didnt worth the money .. it was a bad quality and it is very soft so it cant hold the her in a good way to pull it down , ita was hard using it",1
1,I didn't know what happened but I read the instructions and I tried put in my nails and it was impossible used it never stick to my nail. It is really sad because the design are beautiful.,1
1,Did not like at all.  Product has no instructions what so ever and did not do what it claims to do.,1
1,"I ordered a 300pc and received a 105pc of grommets.<br />However they hold my needles in place well.<br />I like the nippled grommets, as they are much easier to install/remove from a needle bar than whole grommets, and they aren't sloppy like straight half grommets.<br />I have contacted them about this, and will find out if they plan on fixing this situation later.<br />Until then, I can not in good conscience give them more than 2 stars.<br />As of 4/23/14 they still have not contacted me back when I asked them what they planned to do to correct not sending my full order.<br />With sellers like this, I don't plan to use Amazon ever again.",1
1,"I have used this razor for two months.  The first month provided a clean shave, as you get with most new electric razors.  After two months of use the blades seem as dull as a razor that has twelve months of use on it.  On the plus side I do like the long battery life between recharging. You might as well go with a cheaper electric razor as the blades will last just as long and most likely longer than the blades on this high priced razor.",1
1,"Being new to Olay I thought I would try a number of products to find what works for my skin. Microgenerist serum and cream are both excellent and my skin looks and feels great.  This Advanced Anti-Aging Deep moisture coats my skin with a silicone like layer, which after a few minutes starts peeling off and looks like I have eraser dust allover my face.  No foundation liquid or powder can be applied over it without streaking badly.  It is going in the trash.",1
1,This item did not meet my expectations. I received a totally different soap. When I receive the correct murchandise I will repost.,1
1,"I definitely regret buying this cologne. The smell is nothing special and even worse, the longevity and sillage is absolutely pathetic. This scent only lasts about 15 minutes, after that you can't smell it at all. Would not recommend this and will never buy it again.",1
1,"This is not working for me I bought five of this I taught Its a good bargain when its on sale..... But it gotten worst when I tried it, gave me more pimples I gave it a try for 2 weeks but my face became worst I don't recommend this.... at all.",1
1,PISSED AS HELL. I ORERED THE FEMALE ONE AND GOT A MALE ONE. I THREW IT IN THE TRASH !!!!,1
1.0,The condition of the product was not good. The pillow case came with black hairs in it. Very disgusting.,1
1,"Buyer Beware!  If you buy, it,prepare for a plethora of very, very long-winded, chatty, gushing emails from the alleged owner/inventor!  I received two such emails of a page+ each from her before I even received the product!  The first one was annoying, but I chose to roll my eyes and overlook it.  The second one was just too much,  A page each of trying to convince the buyer that it is the best invention since sliced bread and, rather pathetically, all but begging for a review, preferably 5 star, thank you.  I asked to unsubscribe to the email list after responding to the alleged owner.  In the process Amazon lost all or most of my trust by their sharing the email address (private data) and allowing this annoying process.  So annoyed, I have yet to open the product after finally receiving it yesterday I may just send it back and buy the PedEgg equivalent locally.",1
2,"One of the reviews was right, hardly any color on me. It was a little disappointing. But it works good as moisturizer.",1
1.0,Great costumer service but the product is horrible. Please don't waste your money buying this,1
1,The actual bottle was missing. The only thing I received was the dropper and cotton pads. I returned it immediately.,1
1,"This hair dye is VERY dark. I have been dying my hair at home for 10 years, using various shades of auburn. I was watching tv with my kids and saw the girl from victorious &#34;Cat&#34; and I love her hair, so I started looking up color options. I typically dye my hair medium auburn, but have experimented with dark auburn, intense auburn, light auburn at various times. This felt like a safe option for me because it didn't look too far from my auburn safe zone, with an added intensity. wrong. First, I ordered two boxes because I have long hair, and they sent me two different colors. The boxes are larger than what I typically used, so I was hoping it would stretch, and believe it or not it did. But I was horrified after blow drying my hair and seeing BLACK. The front of my hair was black ( I always start at the front) the back was like a deep black cherry color. Like cherry coke. I followed all of the directions, and timed it well. Per my hairdressers instructions, I have been doing hot oil treatments all week, and the dye just pours out. Even if I just shampoo as normal, my bath/shower is DEEP RED. Almost as red as the rinse water when I dyed it! At least that means it is coming out, because I hate the color! After a week, it is starting to look more deep black cherry, and less black. But I will NEVER buy this again.",1
1,"I hate this brush so much it's not even funny. It loses hairs every time, and it simply isn't worth buying the same item again to risk getting another bad one. Just buy a better quality one, and stay away from this one.",1
1,"Product is very bad and unfit for use, and the quality is very poor",1
1,Is a lot smaller than expected it's hard to hold while combing,1
1,"It was really disappointing when I received the product.The box was dirty, the perfume old and the body lotion spoiled.It was said to be a new product,but it wasn't. It looks and smells like old stuff.Terrible choice.",1
2,While I love the product I giving it 2stars because the bottle was broken when I received it and a large portion of its contents had spilled out.,1
2.0,"I have curly hair. When I straighten it I have major problems with frizz. I really thought this product would be the cure, but it wasn't. I followed the directions on the box and sprayed it on my hair prior to styling, but it really doesn't eliminate the frizz. I found that my Frieda gloss worked better and it's a lot cheaper. Oh, well.",1
2,I gave 2 stars only because there is a lot of brushes but out of all of them I only ended up using 5.. All the other either broke off or the hair started falling out.,1
1,"I ordered from this company and what I received were opened bottles of product, they had been resealed (sloppy) with regular postal tape.  Once I pried the tape off and opened the bottle the seal underneath had been broken.  I would not order from them again.",1

2,good product but too expensive (walmart had similar products for $3),1
2,"This was my second bottle of Norvelle but my first double dark.  It is not very dark at all, and the color really don't last past two days. I'm disappointed",1
1,"It does the job, but at the cost of saddling you with a<br />horrible chemical scent that you cannot loose.  Not recommended for anyone who does not wish to offend with<br />a bad scent. Unusable because of the bad scent.",1
2,Was not 400 I counted only 234,1
2,"I really haven't seen any difference. I use it some, but not religiously since I couldn't see that there was any improvement.",1
1,The product's pump is deficient. I only got to use it 3 times before it stopped working. I would think twice before buying this,1
1,"I have used this stuff for 2 1/2 months with no change in my acne.  I have stop using it and my face is looking better, what's up with that!!!",1
1,"This is not the ideal eyebrow primer if you want quality. It gets flaky and leaves white residue on your brows. Also, it dries almost instantly leaving you with no choice but to fill in your eyebrows at a rapid pace and if you mess up there is no going back! Do not buy this is you are a beginner to filling in your brows or like quality or if you like to take your time with your brows.",1
1,I really do NOT recommend it! The On/ Off switch on the handle  leaks badly. It is very noisy!,1
2,"I agree with other reviewers. This product used to be awesome. Something has been changed or modified or removed, because now it is just another shampoo. So disappointing now. Nice smell and lather, but if you are looking for a volumizing shampoo look elsewhere.",1
2,"This product does what it says, but it is so uncomfortable to use that its not worth it. The plastic cone is an awkward size for most people, and it hurts my neck after 5 minutes of resting my face in it. I do like the electric face brush, its great for exfoliating.",1
1.0,"Sample size that one would expect to get for free when trying a product. Terribly disappointing. Not worth the cost. Maybe a few bucks, but def not what they're charging. Just go to a store and buy the real deal and don't waste your money like I did.",1

1,"The opening in the end is not even circle and it does not work on blackheads at all.<br />If I had not ripped the package I would have returned it.<br />It just does not work I think there is design flaw; the loop is too big and it does not apply equal pressure around the blackhead; therefore it does not extract it.<br />I was not expecting something like this by REVLON, I am surprised/disappointed.<br />I have ordered a new one which was claiming to be &#34;fine&#34;r and it is not by revlon.

1,is probap;y half water.i have a sample from a saks and is nothing like this.this smells for 5 sec.its a shame amazon lets such sellers around.,1
1,I am very disappointed with amazon since the picture of this product makes you believe that you are getting the whole SET of bags. I was not expected to receive only one piece. The smaller one..!!!!! so in my opinion is very expensive...!!!!!,1
1,"Didn't do much for me at all. I kept spraying it and spraying it, and she acted about the same as if I wouldn't have it on. It smells like bod man spray in my opinion, would give zero stars if I could .",1
2,"I purchased this straightener in Silver because of its price and good reviews. Unfortunately, the silver model is different from the black & pink models. There are not enough images of the silver model on the page to show it only has the ON/OFF sliding switch on the side. This model does NOT have the temperature adjust knob as shown in the Black/Pink model pictures. That was disappointing.<br /><br />The model felt cheaply made. There is a small gap between the plates when pressed together. I have short,  shoulder-length hair,  thick, fine-to-medium coarse hair. My hair is straight but frizzy, I use straightener in the morning on dried hair to tame the frizz and to enhance the shape, usually takes 10 minutes or less. This straightener does get the job done, but it took longer. It was not the best I've used.<br /><br />It does support dual voltage, but it does not have to auto-off feature.",1
1,"Has a nice, light pleasant scent and comes in a visually pleasing bottle with a snap open/close top.  It has a nice texture, not too greasy, far better than baby oil, and left the skin feeling silky smooth.  If you want to use only one massage oil, this would be the one to buy.    edit 8/19/14    It is not often that I come back to do a complete 180 and change my glowing first impressions of this oil.  Everything I said was true... at first.  But after a 8 months using it, I noticed a sticky film on everything it touched.  The bottle had an all-over sticky film on it.  Anything which had come in contact with it was sticky.  I tried several de-goo'ing products to remove the residue without success.    I opened the bottle and the contents smelled rancid.  All the towels which came in contact with the oil were destroyed by the stench, forcing me to buy all new towels.  I wrote the company, Keyano, and inquired if they knew of a way to remove the residue.  They did not give me the honor of a response.    The oil itself is expensive and I estimate it caused close to two-hundred dollars in property damage.    If you're looking for a massage oil to leave a lasting impression, boy you found it.",1
1,"This did not smell like roses to me.  It had a heavy, dank smell to it.  I returned it.",1
2,I must say I really like these vitamins. My hair growth is a lot faster. Your hair will grow faster all over so if you don't like to shave a lot then it's not for you. I love them though!! I purchased 2 bottles of the 90ct for $24/ea on Jan. 30th. Now the price is jacked up to $50/ea???? No way I'm paying that for vitamins. I will just switch to another comparable brand at a much cheaper price. It's sad though because I have been using these for 9 months.,1
2,"I was expecting to see &#34;peeling&#34; but only saw small areas. However, my skin did swell and therefore diminished the size of pores and appearance of wrinkles for about 12 hours. I've ordered 70% glycolic acid to see if I get the results I had hoped for. I do not have sensitive skin and maybe that is why the 30% did not work as expected. I received this product well wrapped, packaged and guicl;y delivered. I would give the seller five stars.",1
1,I sent this item back. I did not even use the brush but just brushed it across my hand and the bristles were falling out.,1
2,"I Have not seen ANY results!!! Bought it based on other reviews. But, I'm very Disappointed as I Don't see any changes on my stomach!!!<br />I DO NOT Recommend this product!!",1
2.0,I have curly and dry hair and was hoping this product would provide nourishment.  I was disappointed.  It left my hair frizzy.,1
2,I am a guy and i bought this to remove hair from my arms and shoulders. It is not as good as i hoped so. It is hard to get all the hair on my arms and impossible to remove any from my shoulders. Disappointed.,1
2,"Remember a couple of years ago when Neosporin released their \\""Neo To Go\\"" and they claimed it was Neosporin yet it wasn't? This is like that, it says Listerine on the bottle, but it's more akin to a regular mouthwash like Scope. Yes, you will notice I am not a Verified Buyer of this product, it's because I had the presence of mind to buy a 500mL bottle at a brick and mortar store to test it out and I am quite glad I did. The thing about alcohol, like other antiseptics, is that they burn for a reason, just think of all that Bactine, iodine, alcohol, or peroxide you used/use on cuts and scrapes, it HURTS, yet you keep using it. Listerine has been around for a very long time, and there is a reason it has alcohol in it, it's a great antiseptic, so if you have cankers, ulcers, cuts, or other problems, it's going to take care of it (and trust me I had plenty of ulcers growing up) and help them heal faster. But Listerine Zero lacks alcohol, so it really isn't an antiseptic even though it contains the same traces of \\""essential oils\\"" as the true Listerine.<br /><br />Listerine Zero is good if you want to freshen your breath after lunch as it is better than mints, that is if you do not have an adverse reaction to it like some other people on here do, but if you actually want to contribute to your oral health, especially if you have dental work such as a bridge, stick with the original Listerine brand. If the burn bothers you, try their orange flavor (it is less intense than my preferred flavor, Arctic Mint).",1
1,I ordered legal sunburn blush but was sent some kind of peachy blush instead. It was the wrong product and the wrong color. It is worthless to me.,1
1,"I wasn't expecting a miracle but some signs that this product was actually doing something. The wrinkle part I know takes time...but the acne I was hoping it would some how help. I mean not get rid of it completely but at least slow/shrink it down or help prevent future breakouts, it did nothing for me.",1
1,"If you want to pay the same as before but have them take away the space equivalent to two of your bottom teeth, go for it.<br />This LUXE shape is simply horrible. The top one is fine, but the bottom one comes in a new format that covers TWO teeth fewer than used to be the case. You end up with this really lame bottom strip and people will see some white teeth, but also the yellow ones now... SO REGRETFUL I though these. Crest keeps getting worse!",1
1,Was incredibly watered down. I purchased from Hayward Beauty - other people seem to have had the same issue.,1
2,My under eye skin tone and lines look the same as before.,1
1,I found the quality to be very poor.  I have owned this product previously  but this one is of far less quality.,1
1,"I used to always purchase my OH MY Katy Perry Lashes from K-mart.  To my dismay they discontinued the OH MY Lashes.  I saw that I could purchase them on Amazon, sold by Luxxe Beauty.  These are not the same, they are not doubled,lush or long in width.  It seems like lashes were thrown in the oH MY box to deceive the buyer.  I am very dissatisfied, I was robbed.",1
2,"I got this as one of my first foundations.<br /><br />Positive:<br />-It's cheap.<br /><br />Negative:<br />-It's not good for dry skin; even after moisturizing and using primer, it seems to dry out my skin and settle into and emphasize any little crack and flake it can find.<br />-It's not good if you have very pale/freckled skin.  I got the very lightest I could find (porcelain; W1) and it makes my skin look too dark and sallow.",1
2,"Does not smell like real &#34;original&#34;cool water. Buyer beware, This is a bad reformulation of the original. Amazon does not except returns on this item !!!",1
2,"I should have spent more money for something like the one that finally broke - I ended up putting a screw in the wall to hold the new one, not what I expected.",1
1,"Let me start by saying this is my favorite mascara, but the stores are no longer carrying it.  I was excited to find it here and went against most of the reviews saying theirs was old.  Sure enough, the stuff is wayyyy old.  I know when my mascara is bad by the smell.  This has that strong smell and is very thick.  I've used Lash-blast-Luxe enough to know.  So disappointed.",1
2,"I bought this because I wanted to avoid using unnatural sunscreen.  I thought this would be perfect: moderate SPF to leave room for a tan and prevent burn and UV rays.  But unfortunately the product is severely lacking.  The actual lotion is such a poor quality that it won't even rub completely into my skin.  It's not smooth at all, compared to other sun lotions.  After applying it, I'm left with an almost gritty white layer that is still there after hours of not re-applying it.  Also, after a day at the beach, re-applying every 2 hours and after going in the water (as the directions specified), I woke up the next day with a sunburn that was blotchy.  Evidently this was because the sunscreen covered some bits of my skin and not others due to to the lack of spread-ability of the lotion.",1
1,I expected and previously reviewed as the same as salon product - words on bottle are different - it is NOT the same - too expensive to be wrong and different,1
2,"Fragrance is not friendly to sensitive skin, and this fragrance is cloying, sweet.  This isn't a mild soap but quite drying.  I wouldn't use this on babies.  I'm using this as hand soap until it's gone.  I've opened it and a return would be inconvenient.  Live and learn, I won't be purchasing this product again.",1
2,"Good product.  Good mouthwash, BUT...  Very small bottle.  Before buying, look at home in a measuring cup how much 8.4 ounces are.  Is was definitely not a good value for the price.",1
1,The fragrance is NOT as I expected,1
1,"As a professional cosmetologist, I am amazed that these rollers are still on the market. You do not need to have fragile or fine hair to have a major problem with these rollers, or any set of rollers from this company. They will tangle all hair types to the point of extreme damage. This will occur with or without hair products such as mousse or styling gel. They grip like glue and will not release the hair without cutting or tugging to the point of breakage. If they have stuck in your hair wet your hair and saturate it with a good detangler (such as Biolage) and try to gently unwrap.",1
2,NOPE. If you like to pumice every time you are shower this is not for you. If I use this once a month then it serves its intended purpose. Any more regularly and you'll end up with rough patches that cling to your bed covers at night. Gross. I've never had a pumice that has done that before.,1
2,First mud I received that is runny.  Too much has the to return.,1
2,Does not trim as I expected. Very disappointed.,1
2,Conditioner didn't make my hair soft as I hoped and the shampoo I don't believe is good for every day use...I would recommend switching after a few washes and coming back to it.,1
1.0,This was WAY to strong! It burned my gums. Definitely to strong for at home use.,1
2,It did not fit properly.  Very uncomfortable.,1
1,Junk will not stay on the feet they keep opening up,1
2,I should have realized from the description on the jar (snott gorilla gel) that I may not like it. I gave it to my cleaning lady,1
2,"The powder is fine, just the right tone for my skin. BUT... the compact design is horrible. It's divided into moveable sections and the mirror is under the powder and puff, so that you can't look in the mirror while you apply the powder. I have to keep an old [[ASIN:B001ESIZ9A Cover Girl]] compact in my makeup kit so that I have a mirror. Don't design people ever try to use their products?!? And why put a round well in a square container -- it just adds to plastic waste. The compact is both consumer and environment unfriendly. Will not buy again unless the design is changed.",1
2,The rollers don't last to long!,1
1,Stopped working after 6 months of use.  Company would not replace before the year warranty was up.  They said they did not sell them anymore.  Too late for a refund as well. Very disappointed  with purchase.,1
2,"I have tried BM twice now, and it just does not work for me. I moisturize and use primer, the makeup never looks right. I cannot blend it to match my skin tone, it rests heavy in my pores and makes my skin look \\""dirty\\"". More to the point, it makes a mess in my bathroom. I do love that it is a powder versus a traditional foundation - but that's the only plus for me...as for whatever reason, the makeup irritates my skin a bit upon application (maybe the brushes). Overall, it does not work for me at all and I will be returning it to Sephora. Hope you have better luck!",1
1,"I bought this at my local Albertsons Supermarket. I began using it about a week or so ago and last night while lying down, my little one (who is 4) asked, &#34;what is this?&#34; I looked and noticed that my armpits were peeling something fierce. I got up and looked in the mirror. Both were extremely red. They looked sunburned. I never had this problem with Dove, which is what I used for years. I was interested in Tom's of Maine due to trying to stay away from aluminum. Yeah. This is going in the garbage can. What a waste.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to getting my Truly's deodorant in on Wednesday thanks to Amazon Prime. :)",1
1,"Ok, so in the picture presented of the product listing, you would assume that the color will be a nice, somewhat bright red. It even said &#34;true red/pomegranate.&#34; Not so. I dyed my hair, followed the instructions, and the color is a dark brown, almost black. I am very disappointed.",1
2.0,Only keeps it warm for an hour and not too hot,1
1,"Horrible. Huge, and very cheap looking. Do not buy.",1
1,"Ordered this, worked for a few weeks, then stopped working. I returned it for a new one, and it stopped working after about six weeks. Contacted Waterpik, they said I had to clean out the rubber stoppers. Did that, still didn't work. Had this one too long to return it, so I won't be buying another one. The older models of this type of Waterpik lasted years. New models apparently only last weeks. Stay away!",1
1,"I have curly hair and a lot of short hairs around my face so I need a good hold. This product gives decent hold, but VERY Flaky and sticky. I've been using this product for about 2 weeks. It looks like I have major dandruff where I've sprayed. Plus, I've noticed the short hairs around my face have started to fall out! I've been using non-aerosol hairspray for 15 years and this has never happened. I will be throwing this almost full bottle out.",1
1,"I used to own one of these and I decided to buy another...well, turns out that either the product was a fake/counterfeit/after-market/not original, as I immediately noticed that it wasn't running up to full throttle until after using it for a while. By the 3rd use, the clippers were hardly moving and hardly producing sound. It suddenly quit working without warning...I was so mad I put it in the trash where it belongs...<br /><br />...I am not too pleased with this because I paid almost $30 for this back then and didn't even use it past a couple months.<br /><br />My advice to you is to avoid these brands and buy something more powerful like the \\""Wahl 79900N\\"" which also adjusts the clipper blade height without having to use a guard/comb and most of all, AVOID BUYING FROM \\""Brand Variety\\"" because they sold me junk and did nothing to help.",1
2,"My kids love this - and was our 2nd unit in 4 years - the 1st unit broke after 3.5 years - but this one hardly lasted 6 months.  Started making noises and shaft pulled out.  Will not buy again.<br /><br />UPDATE - MARCH 27 2012<br />Just before throwing it in the garbage - I contacted Sonicare via their web chat service - described what happened.  Within about 5 minutes they had a new one on the way to me as an in-warranty replacement, along with free shipping back of the old one.  So - I feel good about their service recovery and hope the new one holds up longer than the 1st one.",1
1,"my daughter is in kindergarten and my worst fear as a mother is head lice I have 3 other kids at home 2 girls that also have long beautiful thick hair, so you can imagine how bad it would be if my daughter got it and it went to my other girls, however there is something in this that my daughter is highly allergic to! it broke her out in rash immediately after applying it around her face, behind her ears her hairline it was awful took her to the dr this morning and kept her home from school due to the redness",1
1,"It doesn't have the scent of  anything like honeysuckle. I was very, very disappointed. The price was very high, too. In past experience, Avon has been the only one to have a product that really said &#34;honeysuckle&#34;. At Bath and Body's price it should have had a much better scent.",1
2,Worked great for one month then I heard a noise from the kitchen and the dispenser was constatnly pumping out soap onto the counter.  Nothing but the counter was under the motion detector eye which should not have triggered it to start dispensing soap. It dumped almost a full container of soap out onto the counter. I was suspicious of this device when it looked so much like the Lysol brand I had purchased and found it only worked for about 2 months. The Simple Human one I purchased and placed in the powder room is still working well so will buy another of that brand for the kitchen.,1
2,"The short of it:  It has a decent battery life, not that charging was a hassle anyway.  It's definitely not for heavy duty work, as you must rinse it often or the clippings dam up on it and the blades cannot reach any more hair to clip.  And rinsing often included removing the guard, taking off the foil and manually removing the blockage.  Mine just stopped working after about a year, as in it won't turn on at all.  In the end, I'm not sure it's worth the time and effort involved for this shower unit, it's just as easy to stick with the plug in clippers and have a little more clean up.",1
1,"When I got this out of the package, I realized that the heating plates did not line up and had about a 1 mm gap at one end (which hair slid right out of).  To send it back to the company, I would have to pay shipping both ways.  Kind of a poor way to ensure customer satisfaction.  I will not try another Conair straightener.<br /><br />The straightener heated quickly and I liked its features, but when the basic engineering is a dud, what difference do \\""added features\\"" make ???",1
1,I use false eyelashes on a daily basis. This product is one of the worst I have ever bought. I am so happy that I did not spend too much on them.,1
1,"I purchased this for the brush that expands and contracts allowing for different sized curls.  My disappointment is that when I select the 'low' option the heat from the brush is way too hot!!!  After having this for maybe 2 months, but using it less than 20 times as I do not do my hair every day, I am searching for curling iron that does not get so hot.  I cannot run this for more than a few seconds without having to turn it off.  It's a waste of my money and takes forever to do anything with my slightly shorter than shoulder length hair.",1
2,Too small for use.,1

1,"I love Burt's Bees products and have used many of them throughout the years. I bought this because my lips seemed drier than usual and thought this would be that little extra something they needed. The product is oily but within 15 minutes or so my lips feel very dry and I end up slathering more of this on thinking i just need to give it a chance to really start working.  I am now three days in and i am miserable, going over lunch to buy my good old plain burt's to undue the damage.",1
1,"I'm seeing all of these positive reviews saying it smells like candy or orange-y pink, as if that is a scent.<br />I think this is by far the worst smelling product Old Spice has to offer. It smells like vomit, no joke. Old spice is suppose to have manly scents, but the only manly factor of this is it smells like a guy had too many shots, and we get to bathe in the aftermath.<br />My girlfriend took a shower at my house yesterday and used this body wash without knowing, and almost puked. Totally thought I threw it away, but now its gone for good.<br />Terrible.",1
2,"Over the course of about 5 or 6 months, I have reached the bottom of this bottle of cleanser.  I won't be buying another, simply because it doesn't seem like it did anything.  It didn't make my skin break out or cause any other negative effects, but it didn't seem to improve the health/appearance of my skin, either.    I found it easy to apply and easy to wash off.  The cleanser does not lather up or anything, but I always felt like my face was clean after using this cleanser.  The orange smell is also truly wonderful.  So, it smells good and makes my skin FEEL clean, but the results it produced seem no different from what would have happened if I just rinsed my face with water every night.  Smells great but unfortunately didn't do much for me.",1
1,"Totally NOT worth it!! I bought it and didn't fit me, I gave it to my 5year old sister and it didn't even fit her. The material is really cheap.",1
1,"Unfortunately, the Maybelline Dark Circles Treatment caused my sensitive eyes to burn.  I had to wash it off just a few minutes after applying it.  The applicator sponge is a bit large, making it hard to apply the concealer.  Overall I was very disappointed and threw the product away.",1
2,"As per Justin Yentile's review, this didn't come with the advertised contour-following comb, and as nearly everyone here has observed, the comb that it does come with sucks.  As per Justin's instructions, I called Philip Norelco customer support at 800.243.3050 and asked for the contour-following comb.  The woman informed me that it does not come in fact come with that comb; I complained that the product's page at their web site says that it does and has a picture of the comb pivoting on a hinge.  She told me that they're trying to fix the website to correct that, and as a one-time courtesy she'd send me the contour-following comb.  I just got off the phone with her--I'll wait until I receive it to ammend this review with my impressions of the product and adjust my rating.  I have no idea why they'd choose to supply the more expensive model with an inferior comb (the comparison table says that it has \\""Stubble + Contour Following Comb\\"", which implies that it should come with two different combs).",1
1,I am very disappointed in the 2 bottles I received.<br />It appears they have been tampered with and &#34;watered down&#34; and NOTTTTT the TRUE Kerastase PURE product.<br />I am EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED.<br /><br />T. Kelley,1
2,These clippers are not ajustable and seem dull. In my opinion they do not work well on african american hair. I had to go back to my old ones...,1
1,"I liked the old Mitchum gel, but this new version is terrible.  As the other reviewers have noted, the good reviews are for the previous generation of this product.<br /><br />The new product is so watery that it leaks all over, running down the sides of the container when you roll even a small amount out to be applied.  This gets on your hands, your bathroom counter, etc. and is hard to wash off.<br /><br />Making matters worse, while the old container actually had a cap with 3 bumps on the inside that plugged the three applicator holes through which the product is dispensed, the new container has dozens of holes and the cap does nothing to keep the watery gel inside. So forget packing it in your gym bag or suitcase--you'll find it everywhere: a good amount stuck up in the cap and more anywhere else it can spread.<br /><br />I will never buy this product again.",1
1,"I orginially posted a review in January 2013 and never heard a thing ... !!!!!  The bulb of the brush fell out of the handle ... was not a good solid, completed glue job from the maker.  I filled the hole in the handle and put the brush make in ... seems to be holding now.  I have not had the reported rusting problem with the bowl ... I have not taken the shaving soap out so it may be there and the black part of the razor handle turns on the shaft.<br /><br />I will not buy this product again and I will not purchase another product offered by Bey-Berk ...",1

1,"I bought this in search of a replacement for the John Frieda surf spray that was discontinued.  I have very thick wavy hair and the John Frieda product was perfect for volume and actually curled my hair.  The Bumble and Bumble added texture, but weighed my hair down.  It  actually pulled the wave out of it.  It left my hair very knotted and tacky feeling.  My biggest issue with this product and the reason for this review was washing it out.  I had to wash several times and use a massive amount of conditioner to do so. I lost so much hair from combing the tangles out WITH the conditioner still in my hair.  As I am writing this 20 minutes later my scalp is still tender.  Buyer beware! Especially those with wavy, curly or thick hair! Big ouch!",1

1,"I'm a product of the early '90s, 5'2\\"" (158 cm), size 2, pale skin w/pink undertones, dark brown (\\""black\\"") hair<br />LHR in a med spa gave me ~50-70% reduction on my upper lip, neck (hairline), underarms, & legs. The technicians weren't thorough & they burned me. I didn't have the time/money for more LHR in a different med spa - hence, the TRIA.<br /><br />It's embarrassing how much time I've wasted, but I make no exaggerations.<br />I did 6 rounds of treatments spaced ~2 weeks apart, but ultimately returned the TRIA. (side note: I also used an older version of the Tria as well 2 or 3 times a long time ago too before returning it)<br /><br />Time consumption:<br />treated almost everything - face & body<br />1 round of treatments took ~5 hours of TREATMENT TIME (actual time spent zapping hairs). Each charge lasted ~20 minutes on the highest setting (5); then the TRIA had to be charged ~2 hours; therefore, it took ~3-4 days of treatments for 1 round.<br />VERY time-consuming b/c the laser tip is tiny and I overlapped.<br />Actually, I totally cheated; if I were as good about the overlapping as the directions recommend I estimate 1 round would've taken at least 10 hours of treatment time (more than one week of treatments).<br /><br />While using the TRIA (same as w/med spa LHR) you must shave & must not remove hair by the root. Until you're completely done with treatments, you spend time shaving plus time using the TRIA & you can't save yourself time by using more long-lasting hair removal methods (i.e. waxing, plucking).<br /><br />It's inconvenient compared to med spa LHR<br />1 round of treatments:<br />med spa: go in once or twice to treat everywhere<br />TRIA: 12+ ~20 min sessions w/~2 hours of charging in between (3+ days spent; the time waste sucks but the timing does too; using it every 2 hours meant whatever else I was doing got interrupted & I mostly stayed in the house for 3-4 straight days)<br /><br />Boredom:<br />little to do while using it - they suggestwatching TV but it was hard enough to keep track of where I zapped w/o any distractions. Plus, it's very noisy. I listened to music but the TRIA's noisiness was irritating. It sucks just remembering spending 4-5 hours over the course of a few days zapping away.<br /><br />Pain factor (on 5):<br />painless except for upper lip, underarms, lower abdomen, genitals (OW! details in side note on pubic hair) & randomly some spots<br />Stubble seems to make treatments painful; I shaved before treatments but I can't always get a smooth stubble-free shave.<br /><br />Effectiveness:<br />slight reduction in quantity and coarseness of hair... I'm not too critical about the minimal results b/c I didn't use it for the suggested 6 months. However, I was hoping for near hairlessness of areas for which I had already had LHR. I was sorely disappointed (ex. 5-6 LHR treatments for underarms in the med spa + 6xs w/TRIA = I continue epilating)<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />time-consuming, unfun & painful<br />It might kill hair but the real deal-breaker was the major time suck (& not whenever convenient, but in regular intervals). If I could devote several days each month for 6-8 months to using TRIA I'd say it's ok, but in real life I'm a full-time student & work part-time. For now, I shave, trim ([[ASIN:B00141DEAC Cleancut PS335 T-Shape Personal Shaver]]), epilate ([[ASIN:B001EWFBLQ Braun 5180 Silk-Epil X'elle Easy Start Epilator]]) & tweeze ([[ASIN:B000EMWFBQ Tweezerman  Stainless Steel Slant Tweezer]]).<br />I haven't given up; next stop: electrolysis! :)<br /><br />side note on pubic hair:<br />The directions warn not to go further than the bikini line, but the technology should be safe for a full Brazilian. My skin was w/in the safe range of tones so I zapped away. Even though I used setting 5 elsewhere I used 1 here. It still hurt; listening to loud music helped a little. It hurt the most on the mons pubis (I think stubble = intense pain) rather than hurting more the further in yougo. I did a session on 5 & it was EXTREMELY painful; I couldn't quit cursing (helps w/the pain). The area was red for a few days. The next time I used it on 1 & it was significantly less painful but still very painful. I think I have a high pain tolerance but it hurt a lot.",1
2,The mirror has distortion & is much smaller then I expected it to be. The description says that you can use the wall adapter as an option instead of batteries but that's not the case. I have returned it & purchased a different Jerdon mirror that I love.,1
2.0,For the price I thought it would be lorger.,1
2,"I looked far and wide to finally find this All-In-One Lipstick, Blush and Eyeshadow!<br />Only one place had it and they were across the world I guess..They charged me $7 for each of the 10 that I ordered but charged about $10 for shipping on each one! OUCH!!!  Loved the Lipstick..Gave all of them away to friends..I would recommend the item but you had better check the shipping charge. These are estimates on the prices, as this was some time ago..",1
1,"I didn't get 1200 jewels like it says.. instead, I got nearly 200. that's a whole thousand left! I would've ordered from someone else even if it wasn't as cheap. now we know why it was so darn cheap! THEY RIP YOU OFF!",1
1.0,"The Q&A section says this moves up and down. It doesn't, from what I can tell. The needle length can be adjusted up and down, at set up, from 0 to 2mm. But once you pick your length and start the machine, it just vibrates. Not what micro needling is supposed to do. If you watch videos of simulations of micro needling, the point is to move up and down to puncture your skin multiple times. Not to vibrate.",1
1,"not worth the money, mine had actually been used and returned I guess because there was clearly 1/3 missing",1

1,"I am so disappointed with this product.  If you have been using Straight for a long time, beware!  This product has changed.  It now has a very, very strong scent.  If you are at all sensitive to scents, do not order this product.  I have Migraines triggered by scents, and this product sent me into a three-day migraine.  On top of the scent, the product does not work as well as before.  This new and improved product left my hair with a frizzy and flyaway look.  How very disappointing.",1
2,Very little.  I did not like.,1

1,"I'd bought this before and had great experience with it, but this time around, my bowl has a bunch of unnaturally bright green specks all over in it, as well as some dark, almost black specks which is odd. Maybe this batch got contaminated or was lesser quality so they added color to hide it. Very disappointed that they would even do that. Oh well. Time to find a different brand.",1
2.0,"I just wanted something to even out the dark spots, and make myskin look more radiant. But this product gave me no progress, but instead hives! Which lasted for 2 weeks after ceasing use. I probably had a more extreme reaction than most people will have, but just saying reconsider if you have sensitive skin. I tried Ambi instead, which worked beautifully!",1
1,Do not buy. I used the product for almost 2 months and no results. This product was a waste of monwy,1
2.0,"I did like the closer shave these blades (provided to me for free, thanks to Gillette Venus) give, as well as the scent of the moisturizing bars.  I did not like, however, the way the moisturizer bars are placed on the razor; it would be great if they were more like the other Venus razors in that the bars do not break off after a few uses.  Other than that, these are nice!",1
1,I was looking for 129. The search came up with this. I don't like the color but since there wasn't any warning that this is NOT 129 I ordered it and can't return.,1

1,nooooooo. absolutely did not even stain my hair,1
2,Impossible for me to use without getting burned.  Advertised as a wand but just a twisted hot iron.  Sent it back.,1
1,"wow, I don't know if I got a dud or what.  There are so many glowing reviews for this straightener, but the one I got is not great at all.<br /><br />My hair is fairly thin with just a bit of a wave.  I'm not trying to straighten incredibly curly hair or anything.<br /><br />My experience was like many of the low reviews.<br /><br />-it took quite a long time for this to heat up.  I'm used to my previous conair one that was ready by the time I used the bathroom and brushed my teeth.<br />-after heating up, when I started straightening, the light started blinking right away showing that heat was going down, so it needed to heat up again.  By the time I got to the second side of my head, I could tell it was not very hot at all on my hair.  (I don't believe it gets as hot as it claims it should).<br />-in the end, my hair really didn't straighten that well.<br /><br />No, it's not as $$ as a Chi etc, but it's not the cheapest thing either...I expected a lot more, especially from the reviews.<br /><br />I am returning it.  I picked up the Remington silk ceramic for half the price of this one at a local store and I can already tell it is way better.",1
2,"I got my iron in July. I registered it and verified it was genuine. It was a good styler until it broke 3 months after I bought it. I have never spent so much money on any single styling item before in my life and I never will again. After doing some research I found out that the thermistor in my iron had broken, which from the number of similar consumer comments I found seemed to be quite common. I am sending the iron back to ghd for repair. I hope they will honor the purchase since I've heard they won't take back irons bought on Amazon. It makes me sick to think about it.",1
1.0,I followed the instructions as enclosed and it just did not work for me after 5 days. The color was  very faded and spotty,1
1,8 dollars plus for a barbie size spray not worth it. I was being silly thinking 0.17 ounce was travel size.,1
1,"I hated this dye. I put it in the two streaks of hair where I wanted it, and left it as long as it said to. I rinsed it out (again, like it stated to do) and there was nothing. Nothing but my own hair color. This stuff is garbage. I am going to try Manic Panic next time.",1
1,I'm sorry but these tweezers are so cheap. They bend and you can't grab literally anything with them! I even tried to pick up an eyelash and it couldn't do that. It's a great waste of money. That's for sure.,1
2,"I have purchased this product in salons before, and it has a lovely fragrance. Unfortunately, the product I received from Amazon not only has a distinctly sour smell, but it is more watery than usual. I am still using it because I didn't want to go through the hassle of figuring out how to return it to Amazon. But I think it was probably exposed to too much heat or sat in a warehouse for too long.",1
2,"I am disappointed in this product because the pictured stand is NOT included.  Unless traveling, the pouch that is included is not convenient.  I haven't actually tried it yet due to the requisite 10 hours of pre-use charging time.",1
1.0,Made my hair feel brittle and crunchie.  My hair is usually soft but I wanted to help keep it healthy because I was growing it out. This stuff ruined my soft hair and it's taken months to fix. I would give it zero stars if I could....also both bottles leaked during shipping so I wasn't impressed with that either,1
1,"I purchased this product and was hoping for some success  Yes, I should have known that it was going to run like crazy, but I assumed it would perform better.  It is very very oily and runs tremendously.  I have used oil moisturizers before and they were a lot more stable in application.  Net, might be an ok product, but the oil is too heavy for me to continue to use it.",1
2.0,it is ok,1
1,"This item is not good quility at all. I only used 3 times and the heat was burn. And it cann't stay long as I need. It only last 10 minutes. As for facial steam, it is better steam for the face at least 20 minutes and the skin can be warm up and the pore is opened so that it will get deep cleaning. I am a cosmetologist so I don't feel this is good to recommend people to buy it.",1
2.0,Doesn't change color!,1
1,The scrunchie piece was more difficult to place on head than expected. Good color it was as expected.  Never received the bangs.  Probably would not order from this site again,1
1,This product smells disgusting. A co-worker who sits 3 cubicles away wears this crap and it makes me sick. If you want tea just drink it geez.,1
2,"When you spray the cologne it smells great. Just like Cotton Candy! But almost immediately the scent vanishes.<br />Literally 2 minutes later, there is no trace of the scent.<br />Very disappointed.",1
1,"I have an Oral B toothbrush that I use for 3 minutes at night.  It leaves my teeth feeling and looking clean.  When I use the Emmi-dent toothbrush with the accompanying toothpaste for 5 or more minutes, my teeth still don't feel clean, and don't seem to look as white as with my Oral B.  I can't say if there's some kind of extra sterilization going on -- but based on feel and looks only, I've gone back to using my Oral B one-half of the time.  So far, I would not buy this product again.<br /><br />Update: 8/28/2013  After continued use, I definitely do see that my teeth are whiter.  I still feel that the product is a bit expensive (along with the toothpaste which you must buy to use with the toothbrush) but it does seem to deliver.  I would probably give it five stars now based on performance, but take it down to three stars when figuring in price.<br /><br />Update:  8/1/2014  Have only used this a few times a week, but it died on me.  Will not charge, will not run.  Definitely consider this a bad purchase.",1

My bank statement shows the total amount of the product was debited the day the purchase was made. There's no way to contact the seller either. I gave it a star because I'm required to do so in order to submit a comment, I've actually never tried this product.",1

2,"Like the design of this eyeliner and believe it would be great if it had not arrived dried out. Nice tip but color did not come out black, was more of a very washed out gray as if the product was old. Only a small amount came out of the pen as well. Tried to add some water to the felt tip to see if that would help, but still did not work.",1
2,"Brush heads were delivered early.. That's good... But the packaging was damaged.. A closer inspection of the product description did mention that packaging was damaged but product is unaffected . My bad... Not sure why someone would want toothbrushes that were subject to insects, vermin dust and whatever they would encounter in the warehouse or in transit",1

1,"I used to order Proactiv and I was happy when I got the dark spot corrector as a free gift. When I started using it I noticed that overtime it would develop a horrendous smell that would not go away, as much as I tried. The dark spots did not fade by much and thats why I gave it one star. I use an aveeno product now and this cream hydrates and evens tone way better than this and is cheaper. Like other commentors before me said, check out other alternatives first.",1
1,"Had to return to vendor.  Worked fine the first time used to remove about 3-5 hairs from my upper lip.  After three months, new growth appeared (very fine hair) so wanted to zap them.  Unfortunately, the kit would not work when I tried to use it.  Tried several times and even changed the battery.  Still could not get it to activate.  This is unfortunate, because it really worked the first time.  The new growth were new hair folicles.  The first hairs that I electrolysized did not grow back.",1
1,"Very, very sticky. And it left a lot of broken hairs. Left a big mess and stubble. Not sure if its just the cream waxes or what. I like the Satin Smooth honey with vit E and some others. But not this one.",1

1,It works real good.,1
1,"The bristles of this brush are very hard. My hair is very fine and just shoulder length. Every time I used it I felt as though I was punishing myself with a medieval weapon. It didn't create fullness or curl. I think this product might be better for very thick heads of longer hair, but much too painful for me with no benefit.",1
1.0,No difference in the scar at all,1
1,Arrived in shards.  Had to return it---a real pain.,1
1,"Contains benzoyl peroxide which is super hard on my skin. Not what I expect from Image, whose products are usually so gentle.",1
1,Cut my husband's face up like crazy!  He tried a couple of the razors and the experience was the same.  He'll have to look further for something that will not be so problematic.,1
2,"I love Australian Gold products and was excited to buy Forever After All Day Moisturizer at a good price. Unfortunately, I'm very disappointed in this AG because of the horrible scent/smell. I thought I was buying the summer-like scent I've come to expect from Australian Gold, but this is ... phewwww!    To be fair, the silky moisturizing factor is great ~ my skin felt wonderful and soft for hours after I applied. However, the scent (difficult to described, but it reminds me of something my grandmother used in her 80's) is much too overpowering and much too strong. I grudgingly gave 2 stars (simply for the moisturizing factor).    I purchased 2 bottles and might end up giving them to the nice little old lady that lives on my street. Hopefully, the smell won't be too strong for her senses.",1
2,"After trying Burberry's Brit for men, I have a few things to say about it.  You better like smelling like a baby, since all I could smell was the overtones of baby oil and a light, powdery note as well.  I've heard people rave about the ginger note, smoked vanilla, and really, really wish that I could see through all the BS, but I believe, at the end of the day, that Brit isn't delivering anything new.  Yes, it isn't as spicy as I usually prefer, and I was open to something new, but Brit reminds me of a few colognes I've experienced in the past.  It has an understated presence like Grey Flannel.  It's one you'll be able to smell, not overpowering, and a rather developed scent.  Not that Grey Flannel was a fave, either, just a comparison.  The initial note will have you believing that Brit is much more spicy than it ends up.  Truth is, after it dries down, the \\""surprise\\"" factor is lost, and it has some of the irritating notes I've come to dislike in other underdeveloped scents like Joop, and >gasp&lt; Curve.  It may be a newer direction for Burberry, and one that's not so stuffy, but I would rather purchase a unique scent instead of one that is a cross between too many uncertain notes.",1
1,"Don't waste your money on these.  Just clean the blade periodically with the brush that comes with the shaver.  If you want to take an extra step use some shaver oil in a can that braun or norelco sells.  These refill cleaners are a scam.  Basically it's a way for a company like Braun to make you keep buying stuff.  A shaver can be properly maintained per the instructions that they come with for years.  I had a Syncro 7575 (believe that was the model) which came with this system of automatic cleaning.  After buying one refill I never bought it again, all the cleaner is made up of is some lubricant and alcohol maybe a detergent.  I went on to use the Syncro for four years without a problem.  I then bought an activator and have never used the automatic cleaning apparatus, just use it to hold the shaver and the shaver hasn't had a problem for at least three years now.",1
1,"Absolutely no power! Waste of money & very timely to try and cut anything. Used once & threw in the garbage. You have to pass over the same spot over and over and over and OVER. As soon as clippers touch hair, the motor bogs down.",1
2,"I purchased this product after reading reviews on how Everyone compared this to the real beauty blender. How it wasn't exact but very close to the real deal. I had purchased the item alone with 2 phone cases by the same seller. I thought wow such a cheap price why not! Believe me save the $3. Your supposed to dampen the sponge before makeup application. The sponge or I like to call \\""rubber ball\\"" hardly moisten and never expanded. While applying my makeup I noticed it made little round spots all over my face. Even after I tried blending it out it never worked :(. Was very disappointed but hey that's what you get for buying something so cheap!",1

One broke down in a week, and the other one about four months later.<br />I have replaced them with regular brushes from Oral-B for half the price, they are still working fine a year later. Also, the cheapest product from Oral-B feels better than the best product that Bling sells.",1

They look like they're going to be normal sized until you take one out and it's a 2&#34;x2&#34; moist towelette that burns the eyes.

I have large skin pores at the T zone.

2,"As is often the case, this Remington provides a good close shave.  But the third \\""mini\\"" foil is cumbersome at best and not at all helpful.  Most frustrating of all is it's inability to hold a charge.  I may have just received a defective unit, but after 2-3 shaves it needs to be fully re-charged.  Not real happy with this unit and will likely switch to a different style of Remington or perhaps go back to a Braun, which I've enjoyed in years past.",1

2,"Full, long, thick lashes are always in style, but applying false lashes daily isn’t always practical and is very time consuming.  So finding a way to get the look of fake lashes without actually having to take the time to glue them on is life changing!

1.0,Would leave zero stars if I could. Turned my teeth brown and burned the tip of my tongue to the point it hurt to eat or drink anything. I actually had taste buds on the tip of my tongue sloughing off. I had bought it because I have braces and brush/rinse a lot and the burn of alcohol gets to you. I used this for 2 weeks. Teeth that had no stains started staining and my mouth started peeling. I thought it was my fault so I started brushing and rinsing more....it got worse....then the tip of my tongue got all red and bumpy and hurt like I had burned it. But I hadn't. I finally  realized the only thing I had changed in the last 2 weeks was my mouth wash. It is now in the garbage and back to Listerine for me. I'll deal with the alcohol burn over a chemical burn and stained teeth. Hey Crest.....that little itty bitty tiny warning about staining isn't the only warning that should be on that bottle.,1

1,This is not Amber Romance by VS. Looks like it but its a fake. So disappointing. Don't waste your money,1
2,"The hold was fine, and it smells great, and so those are two pretty important things. So why just two stars?<br /><br />Well a lot of products smell great and perform well. My problem with this one is that it is very, very sticky on your hands, and it leaves a white residue if you don't work it in. And I mean work it in a lot. I found I had to use a very small amount (no problem there!) and a good amount of water, but also an unusual amount of time working it in, to get the white residue to go away.<br /><br />I'm actually wondering if I got a bad tube on this, because it was such an obvious and apparent problem for me, and yet looking over the many positive reviews of the product, I don't see anyone else who had this issue.<br /><br />All I can do is review how things worked for me, so I have to rate this poorly. But if you don't see any other similar complaints, I guess it is safe to assume something was wrong with mine.",1
2,It did whiten my teeth but omgosh my teeth got SOOO sensitive and it would like be painful so I stopped using it. I was using sensodine toothpaste while using it but it hurt more and more after 2 weeks I stopped and it I think I'm just going to save up money and go to a professional dentist haha,1

2,Had high hopes for this product but really don't see much difference in my hair once it's applied.  Waste of time and money,1
2,"I thought this looked like the stone used at the local salon here for pedicures, and that stone does an excellent job.  However, after ordering it, it isn't the same and doesn't do a very good job of scrubbing the feet and removing dead skin.  This one is way more smooth than the professional stones used at the salons, so much so that it simply glides over the heel area and isn't abrasive enough to do any good.  Sorry, but if you are looking for a salon quality lava stone with great scrubbing/removing power, keep looking, this one isn't it!!",1
2,I had to return this product. I thought I was getting eye shadows with one color (the white one) as a highlighter for under my brows but all colors were shimmery.,1
1,"it arived in two days wich was great i odered it for chelloc did not even dried my nails in 1 hour!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! workes good only on regular nail polish, wich i did not bey this for, very disapointed.",1
1,This was recommended to my by a girl working at ulta.  I really loved it at first.  It broke two months in.  The one plate broke from the side.  I am irritated that it only lasted two months.  Cheap cheap cheap!,1
1,DIDNT TURN NOT EVEN 1 SHADE LIGHTER. I USED IT AS DIRECTED. THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THIS COMPANY OR HAVE SHARES IN IT MUST BE THE ONES WRITING THE REVIEWS!!! IT PAYS OFF BETTER GOING TO THE DENIST AT LEAST YOU KNOW WHAT YOURE GETTING!!!!,1
1,I didnt like the soap as much as much as i should of. It wasnt worth the money. I wish i could get my money back.,1
1.0,"I did not like the smell. It could be a good product, but I just couldn't get passed that stink smell.",1
2,"I tried it for 3 weeks with combination of dry and in shower and it just doesn't work for me.  I don't have that tough a beard, yet I am back to the expensive cartridges that sent me trying an electric.  See if you can try it before you buy.",1
1,The ink sucks ive done at lease 30 tattoos and I had people call me to tell me that the ink came out of there skin so I had to give there money back,1
1,it smudges,1
1,very inaccurate !!!!,1
1,Y does this product burns my nails under the UV lamp it hurts like hell.. I had this product for a while and haven't use it again,1
1,"No doubt about it, this product was BLUE. I emailed the seller and they said all the product on the shelf was the same color. I did several strand tests and couldn't believe the results: BLUE. BLUE. BLUE. I've used over a half dozen other products since then to achieve my \\""purple hair project\\"" and had fun with different shades of purple. *BUT THIS PRODUCT WAS A RIP OFF*",1
2,"The mirror was great when we just received it, no distortion, clear, no fog, lightweight, good size, just perfect. But it has scratches all over (from top to bottom, from one side to another) just after a couple weeks of use. We do not scrub it, husband said he used his washcloth to wipe it off (manufacturer's response - washcloth is abrasive..). It's still usable though. I am not sure I would order again at this price.",1
2,Did nothing for acne,1
2,"This product was ok but I did not like it. I know it says foam but when I received it, it looked like something a little kid would play with. It was nothing I would put in my hair.",1
1.0,Do not like these grommets but I don't like a lot of grommets so I went back to using paper towl that way I am able to make my grommets soft or hard to my liking.,1
1,"My gums and the insides of my cheeks peeled when I started using this product.  It was highly unpleasant, but stopped when I discontinued use.  I definitely recommend against this toothpaste.",1
2,Although it looked great for the first couple days it faded so quickly that I had to redye it within the week. My hair being bleached most likely helped it last the days that it did.,1
2,"It's just a regular floss, and not even very good. You would buy something as small just for the different taste/smell. But this thing provided neither. Bad floss, small package, no promised bubble gum flavor. DO NOT buy.",1
1,Item not as described!  This is not the item that is listed.  Do not order!!!!,1
2,It says that it makes hair stronger and prevents breakage. Good thing with no conditioner my hair is ripped out of my head. The fullness is from all the frizz.,1
1,I tried this 3 times.  My nail polish came off after 3 days.  It was hard to get the color dark over the whole nail.  The color faded after a couple days.  I kept using thinner & thinner layers but the color was pale and it started peeling off.  I returned it to Costco.  I was really disappointed.  I thought i had found a better solution.,1
2,Their listing does not disclose this to be a sample set. There is barely any product whatsoever. Tubes and jars are miniature. Buyer beware!,1
2,"This product doesn't work for me. Maybe it's because it's a cream and it's harder to apply, but it does not calm the areas of my skin affected with psoriasis.",1
1,It's not what I expected it . It looks like dirt when you apply it on your skin .,1
1,"Unfortunately the hair spray that I've used for 20 + years has changed their formula and did not put on the packaging that it's a new formula!  The old product said &#34;Finesse Silk & Soy Protein Enriched Hairspray Extra Hold Unscented&#34;.  This &#34;Self Adjusting&#34; formula is definitely not the same!  I purchased two of these and first of all, it smells horrible!  It's not as bad as Aqua Net but that's what it reminds me of...Ick!  If you always purchased the unscented formula, they don't have one anymore in the non-aerosol so you get to smell your hairspray all day which I would rather not do.  I can find the old formula in the aerosol on the internet but not in the non-aerosol which is the only type that I will use but I`m sure that the non-aerosol will be going away soon also.  I have fine hair and when I use this product it doesn't coat all of the hair I want to stay in place.  I have stray hairs here and there that fall in my face.  I even tried repeating spraying it several times which made my hair a helmet but those hairs were STILL flying around!!  I'm contacting the company because I want the old formula back (I'm sure that won't happen) or my money back for this junk!  I didn't purchase it here on Amazon.  Now I have to find a different hairspray also which is a huge pain!",1
1,Pigments are so light. It's really useless.,1
1,very very diffciult to peel from original paper & sticker falls apart when pulled.,1
2,"Don't expect that will give you any special relieve on sore muscle.  Cause it doesn't.<br />And don't expect it will give you the similar feeling of the Japanese Hot Spring, cause it's no way to be any close to that.<br />Only advantage is, the container is big, and last quit for a while.<br />If you have nothing to add to your bath, and you bath regularly, it's a good choice.<br />But it won't be a choice for me to use when enjoying my bath.",1
2,"The quality of the Equate line can range from one end of the spectrum to the other, with most I've tried being of good quality. This was not the case with this product. The price point was significantly less than the more prestigious brands, but the product was practically unusable. Nearly all of the towelettes in both packages were too dry to use and even wetting them with water did not seem to help much. If I wanted to do that, I'd just use a washcloth. I will skip this in the future and spend a little more for better quality. It hasn't changed my mind on Equate products in general, but it has made me a little more leery about trying some of their other beauty items.",1
2,"halfway through the bottle, it stops pumping, so you have to put a Qtip in there to scoop the other half out... so frustrating! also, the opening and closing of the top allows for air to get in a dilute the cream...",1
1,"I love the original DDML and was shocked last night when Macys told me that it has been discontinued.  The girl behind the counter told me it will feel the same and I bought it. Needless to say, it went from a five star product to one that shouldn't even be on the shelves.<br /><br />When you first put it on, you will notice that it no longer feels lightweight or smooth. The reason I loved this product is because of how easily it could be layered with creams or makeup. It literally felt like bug spray on my face. If you know what 90% humidity feels like mixed with sweat and stickiness, that is how this so-called improved version felt like. My skin never absorbed it and it felt like it was weighing down on my skin. I washed it off quickly and I would not recommend this to anyone or purchase this ever again.<br /><br />Clinique made a terrible business move and judging from other reviews, many are outraged as well. This new concoction contains barley extract, cucumber, sunflower seedcake, and plenty of extra acids to give you hives and acne. If you have sensitive skin like me, run from this terror.",1
2,"the brush isn't the best, the product comes out very clumpy, and requires wiping on a tissue or rag so that you can apply it. Dries very fast so if make a mistake, it's too late to comb through it. I love the fact that it is natural vs. the other products so I will continue to use it, just wish it went on easier.",1
2.0,Not the best trimmer not recommended,1
2,"I would have loved it if it weren't for the old rancid scent that the bar had. I still used it. I don't like things to go to waste, but seriously smelly. Disappointed.",1
2,"Came with 500, but they were all the small inc holders none of larger inc holders came with it.",1
1,"I really don't see any changes, this is my second bottle, I will NOT order more, I use other stuff like andalou, What I do find that makes a difference in my skin is pure raw coconut oil unfiltered, cold pressed. Not expensive and works great on ALL of your body parts, not just the face...Hair, body, face, vaginal area as well.",1
1,Love the products but not the box that I expected  it's only 1 scrub cream 1 can of lotion and 1 bodywash! NO SPONGE NO EXTRA BODYWASH like in the picture,1
2,If you are looking for a wig that you don't mind replacing in several months.........go for it.  The quality just doesn't go far.,1
1,"I picked this up thinking that it would be healthier for my hair that what I had previously been using.  I usually put coconut oil in my hair after washing it, but this time I did not because I wanted to see what the product was like on it's own.  My hair came out dry and frizzy.  It looked terrible.  It had never been frizzier.  Now I use Coconut Cowash by As I Am and it works wonders.  Also, putting coconut oil in your curly hair after showering really smooths it out and helps keeps it healthy.  I use plain old coconut oil people cook with and I buy it from Trader Joe's.  Its cheap.  I've also used jojoba oil, but I like coconut oil much better.  Check out As I Am Coconut Cowash.  Its a much better product than this.",1
1.0,Does not work.  worked the first time and then it doesn't wish I had the box to return  so disappointed. I hate wasting money.,1
2,"I was told this product \\""really works\\"" by an Avon sales rep. Well, it doesn't. I'm 29 with minimal deep wrinkles but several around my eyes from sun/tanning bed damage. I've used this product for the past month and it has not made one bit of difference. It did not make me break out though like some skin care products do. But it simply did not help to minimize wrinkles or make my skin feel tighter/softer/smoother. The $10 DMAE cream I got at Walgreens works better. The product's claim is that it is supposed to make your skin produce more collagen on it's own so you have to quit using anything else you use with collagen in it, which I did and I think my skin actually looks worst. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!",1
2,I actually meant to buy another product that I have been using and apparently clicked on the wrong one.  I found this product to be extremely drying on my lips and stopped using it after just a couple of days.,1
2,It was not the same product that is pictured.  Product has changed but was able to return without hassle.,1
1,"After getting The Brazilian Blowout treatment, my stylist really pushed this shampoo/conditioner/serum on me. At almost $40 per bottle (in the salon) I'd expect a lot more. My hair is thick, but the strands are fine. It gets frizzy if I don't flat-iron, but isn't curly. My hair responds well to most good shampoos. With this stuff, my hair felt dirty and weighed down. It wasn't even shiny like it usually was.<br /><br />It has a very light citrus smell (think Citre Shine from the drug store) which didn't last. I want my hair to smell like a nice product, otherwise it picks up random smells like coffee or smoke.<br /><br />I started using the Moroccan Oil line and my hair is looking, feeling, and smelling much better. I'm enjoying my Brazilian Blowout much more and will keep doing it, but won't use their products.",1
2,"It's called a peanut and that's basically what it is. The power was mediocre... I mean it made a lot of noise and it moved fast, but the cutting and the precision was very weak. Andis is a lot better! This clipper really is not low enough to line hair.  Give it to the elephants,",1
1,Horrible wig was torn it was very cheaply made.,1
1,I purchased this because it was supposed to adjust to whatever length one wanted to cut his hair. The setting does not hold and the the result is a mangled hair cut. i am returning it. Fortunately I was able to use an older clipper to salvage my hair cut.,1
1,Nota good polish.  Very cheap,1
1,"This product was manufactured in September, 2009. It has expirated at least six months before I got in March 2013. I could not risk puting such staff around my eyes. Total waste of my money!!!",1
1,"JUNK !  Broke, about 1/2&#34; from metal part, the first time I used it.  Going back to known brand.",1
2.0,Made my eyes tear after a few hours.,1
1,"I applied this cream twice a day to my stretch marks on my stomach, chest, and legs from my recent pregnancy two months and didn't see a difference at all.",1
1,"I was shocked at how small this product is- the 3 together do not even make one regular sized gloss; The combined amount is 45 mls or 0.15 oz; For those who are not familiar with these measurements, trust me when I say this is incredibly small(think mini perfume sample bottles but smaller); The tin it came in is the size of those little novelty tins that hold medication(In fact I'm holding mine up to the screen and the REGULAR - not enlarged- sized image is BIGGER than the actual product is!); The results are undramatic if even noticeable;The tingling is short lived (maybe two minutes- and the gloss does not stay on any longer than a regular gloss). I had more of a plumping affect by rubbing an atomic fireball on my lips; Save yourself the 18 dollars and buy some cinnamon extract in whichever form you choose.",1
1.0,Product irritates my skin.  I could not use it.,1
1,"I am an aesthetician and a mascara junkie - love to find one that lengthens, is just the right color, doesn't flake, removes easily and is gentle on the eyes. Had read some interesting reviews of this product and was hopeful I could add \\""curl\\"" to the list. Very disappointed! The brush is awful for application, I noticed no extra curl whatsoever, and it was horrid to get off even with eye makeup remover. I used it once and threw it away! Back to Covergirl Lash Blast!",1
2,"Like other reviewer, lever on mine cracked (see pictures) after 2-3 years.  However I ALWAYS used in bathroom which is never colder than 65F.  I don't think the top lever is metal, from the appearance of the crack, the main lever seems to simply be a plastic with thin 'metalized' finish.",1
1,"these are not good, they don't stick to the nail at all. I followed the directions but nope. Not impressed at all.",1
2.0,These suck! You can barely pump any product out and it takes forever for the pump to come back up for you to pump again for product. Threw it away.,1
2,This chair looks great after being put together. Mine arrived in a timely manner but when I took it out of the box had spots on it.I assume from being in plastic and different temperatures.  I watched the video 2x as the chair was not as easy to assemble as the video makes it look. I would also like to add this chair is extremly heavy and not at all comfortable. I am going to use it in my salon and it is very difficult to lay back to the shampoo bowl. I wanted a chair that had a foot rest on it but not as heavy. I may go back to the chair I have been using for 7 years as it easily turned and lays back easily which would make this chair a waste of money because it does neither of those things.  Very dissapointed as I wanted my clients to comfort and easy for me to work with.,1
1,"I ordered once and the brush heads were legit. Then I subscribed and the next order that came they are clearly fake, imitation knock offs! :) I requested a return and am getting my money back. Don't buy these. Amazon needs to clean up the counterfeit goods, it's becoming a problem.",1
2,I use this product everyday since I got it and I don't see No difference. I feel like I wasted my money.,1
2,"Like all L'Oreal mascaras, this brush is awesome. But the wand is so weak and flexible (engineered that way) that you can't really &#34;dig&#34; into the lash line. If you like a light, whisper coat of mascara you'll love this. If like me, you want people to roll their eyes at you because they think you are wearing false lashes at noon..  stick with L'Oreal Carbon Black Voluminous or Lancome.",1
2,"Two drops turns you blue.  I hated it, my husband like it better.  Yellow eyes aren't my problem though, I hoped it would be a killer red-eye reducer.  Stick with Naphcon for clear eyes.",1
2,no noticeable difference in my skin,1
2,"The perfum of Tommy Hilfiger  that I received is not the one that I ordered.  I was very sad when I received it.<br /><br />Regards,",1
1,This product is way way better in the blue original container. This new bottle went right into the garbage after three attempts. I don't know why they had to go and change a good thing. The spray barely comes out and the product hardly sizzles out of the can. Not as effective on my roots either.,1
1,"I understand they are probably not meant for everyday use but for the price I thought I'd order them anyways. Came Fast, but the box was all tore up and the lashes smelled like chemicals. They are really stiff, and made of plastic. Not too mention really, really long ! Not too happy, but hey for the price I can't complain too much. You get what you pay for. Buy at your own risk !",1
2,"I did not realize, that this was a thick form of greese and it was black so it stained my scalp, and itvreally did not help in any why, why I bought it I dont know, Just trying diffrent things.",1
1,Poor quality.  Have to tighten where it swivels every week.  Looking for a better product.,1
2,This product doesn't seem to do anything.  It is slightly colored and towards white but not enough color to cover circles and nothing much else going for it except a little moisturizing.  A moisturizing under eye cover works better.,1
1,horrible and cheap,1
2,"This product is not 100% aloe vera as it states. It has other ingredients, one of which is grapefruit extract.  So if you are looking for pure aloe vera, this is not it.",1
1,Terrible product. Made my hair flat and greasy. Should have read the reviews more closely. Waste of  money.,1
1,"my wife and I both bought a pair of these to go on a cruise just in case we got sea sick.  i put these on and started to enjoy myself, but as soon as the ship got out to sea and started rocking i fealt HORRIBLE for 3 days there and three days back, they SUCKED!!  the only thing that even remotely helped was GINGERAILE, just drink the crap out of it and unless your also hungover you should be cool.",1
1,I used it for one day and it broke. Plastic is very cheap and easy to break. I am very unhappy,1
1,"I bought these plates because the review says it is same as Knoad plates. BUT it turns out NOT!<br />It is Mash plates. Most of them is same as the Bubble Monster 21pc Plates which I have already gotten! I am so so so disappointed about that. I guess just the seller has just changed images this year. Or maybe you get the images randomly.<br /><br />Also, most french nail designs are too too too big...If I print it to my nail, it will be hard to tell which picture it is, because it is too big!<br /><br />After checking it, I found some of the plastic film is peel off before!! It is awful to know you get the used products without notice before.<br />SO, I decide to apply for refund. I know the shipping fee is 5 dollar and I will pay about 4 more dollar to ship it back. I still want to return it. It makes me upset when I see them.",1
1,As soon as I started using the powder and blush brush it started falling apart leaving hair on my face.,1
2,"So, I tried these particular lotions when they first came out. Had a special deal at my Walgreens & so I had two 8oz. tubes. They smelled WONDERFUL! But that was all. I've used Olay lotions for years & they've always been great for my skin. But this stuff was a serious disappointment. As wonderful as it smelled, there was very little moisture & the scent didn't last. Ended up giving them away. :/",1
2,"I wanted this to work.  I hate shaving.  Razor burn, cuts, and all that.  I wanted a simple easy shave in the morning.  The reviews looked good so I gave it a shot for a couple weeks. <br /> <br />The razor itself did a decent job on the cheeks.  As far as the neck when, a blind barber could do a better shave.  It either gave me unbelievable razor burn or completely missed huge patches of untouched hair.  For whatever reason if you had a stray hair left on the neck it couldn't seem to get it no matter how many passes I'd try.  Any blade system from disposable to mach whatever is superior.  This very well might be the best electric razor out there but it's not for me.",1
1,"I immediately had a hard time gripping hairs, and I noticed that the gripper ends don't line up. I contacted Revlon but received no response. I have since thrown them away. They were a complete waste of money, in my opinion. Maybe they were defective, but the manufacturer should have worked with me. Get some plain ol' silver ones!",1
1,noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!<br /> this stuff made my hair so sticky and dry feeling it might be the right bottle but definalty not the same product.,1
1,"I've used and loved this lotion for a couple of years and now it's new packaging and new awful ingredients--doesn't smell as good. Doesn't soothe my pysche or my skin any more! I won't continue buying it and now need to find a new natural lavender lotion. Any suggestions, fellow lavender lovers??",1
2,"This kit comes in a foil embossed case with foam and felt liner to hold items securely.  The scissors, lash comb/tweezer combo are very petite and child-toy like.  It has glue, cleaner and a blower that a passable; also has basic cotton tipped applicators and felt pads that would not do in a professional environment. The lashes appear to be some type of acrylic  or other hard, rough, synthetic fiber, which clumps in the containers. Includes less than helpful instructions that are in Chinese, Korean and broken English.  I purchased this kit simply to help me decide if I want to offer eyelash extensions to my clients.  At the price point ($27) I can practice, to test my dexterity and vision without spending $900 or more for professional training, only to find I hate doing lashes.  The tweezers are good enough for me to practice with.  I have a base of knowledge with lash extensions, so this is working for me.  I am using this on a mannequin, not live models, which I recommend to anyone using this kit.  This is not for professional use, or on your friends or family!",1
1,"This straightener did not get very hot, and it burnt out after less than a year of use. I would not recommend it. I typically have better luck with other reasonably priced brands like con-air and Tigi.",1
1,"first of all when I received the package, the lid had been broken and powder had spilled in the box.The powder has a good strawberry scent but upon putting it in the actual bathtub it loses it and it's basically just like taking a bath in colored water.",1
1.0,the texture of these are not soft and they smell like gasoline.  No way I will put them in my hair.,1

1,"The worst eye lashes ever...hated it, hated it, wasted my money",1
1,"I ordered this because it was suppose to smell better than the alcohol smell the regular Purell has. I must have got a bad batch or something because mine has smells just like alcohol. No spring smell, no smell other than alcohol. I would really like my money back or sent out the correct one. I got 2 bottles because I have used this stuff before and loved the smell, but when I ordered it online it's not the same! I'm bummed I just wasted over 10 dollars for hand sanitizer!",1
1.0,"Sent it back, did not work :-(",1
2,Haven't tried it yet but I got mine open and half spilled out.,1
1,a ponta ativa nao encaixa corretamente na base e fica curvando quando o fio é dobrado. É melhor fazer o ômega com um 139 que com esse Alicate. Acho que ele so é melhor que o da ICE.,1
1,Doesn't come with a way to attach to phone; no adhesive backing. Waste of money. You truly get what you pay for.,1
1,I found the smell of this deodorant too strong and manly.  The smell still lingered in my clothing days after using it.,1
1,It's not the best lip gloss,1
1,I recieved wrong item and tried to contact them and finally got to them to find out that they are slower then ever will not buy again with them,1
2,Cheaply made. Fell apart first day,1
1,jb sucks dick,1
1,I really wanted to love this hair oil after hearing and reading about everyone else's amazing results. Sadly...NO. This oil itched and left blisters on my head. Never again will I touch this stuff! Even after I washed it out my scalp itched something fierce. ...smh...,1
1,"Background: I have long, thick, silky hair that has lost a bit of luster after I went ombre last year.<br /><br />I followed both sets of instructions exactly - wet on Saturday, and dry on Monday. Absolutely no difference whatsoever. Complete waste of my time and money.",1

1,"I returned this as the style in this photo is not what I received and the colour was not anywhere near what it looked like.  I am not happy about the 25% re-stocking fee, especially since I returned in within 30 hours of receiving it.  I won't order anything like this again.  It's a wrip off.",1
1,I wasted time and money on this purchase.  The box that the dimple clip arrived in was worth more than the dimple clip.,1
2,great ingredient list but way too smelly.  just used a dab to test and the smell was overwhelming...like cheap perfume.  had to send back.  also note that it contains SPF,1
1,This stuff doesnt work at all.Sauve with shea works better at smoothing out my hair. This stuff left my hair a dry tangled mess.Save you money buy something else.,1
1,wow what a joke when received in the mail two of them were broke some of them are not even bent right some the ball strip in no time and then they are junk will definitely never order from this company again waste of money uneven on the eye ones,1
1.0,Overpriced!!,1
1,This iron had great reviews so I purchased it. Wrong. Plates appeared cracked and it made a ticking noise when on. Sent it back,1
1,"I buy three bottles, and I just received one bottle 😵",1

2,"I saw the Topstyler Heated Ceramic /styling Shells in a box exactly the same as the one above at Target.  I thought I would receive the same product for $10.00 less, shipping was free.  When it came it was not in the above box and it did not contain 10 large shells plus 5 smaller shells in a drawstring bag and a comb used to help curl into the shell, nor was it rapid heat up as is the one at Target.  It contained 5 large shells, 5 smaller shells and nothing more.  There was no way to get details about this item so I would have known it was not the same though the box and picture of the item looked the same.",1
1,"This is the worst lip gloss I have ever seen. I love bare minerals, I've worn their make up for years. Seriously, it's like the lip gloss of the seventies, icky and sticky.",1
2,"I would not recommend this for pageantry. It is light and not of the best quality.  As a piece for a party, it is fine. If you  are watching you  budget, I guess this would work.",1
1,very disapponting...thought it was a bigger pallette.......nice colors but too small compared to the pic...........pieces of the actual eyeshadow was broken of........,1
2,I got the wrong item which was similar in size but the outer label was trying. Still hoping to resolve.,1
2,"While I like the product, and get good coverage, the twisting to dispense the product makes no sense. You only need a tiny bit for each eye, but so many twists are required that you suddenly get a huge amount that could cover 25 people's circles! And going one click at a time isn't the answer as tried that too. You end up clicking about 8-10 times with nothing at all until that huge blob comes out. Will not buy again and calling Revlon for a refund!",1
1,Very bad and destroy the hair never advise it👎🏼,1
2,"My hair type is 4A natural kinky/curly and I mostly wet bun or blow out and flat iron, occasionally I will wear it curly as a wash and go. When I do use heat, I prefer for it to be administered in the most efficient way to prevent any additional damage and stress to my hair. So I don't use cheap styling appliances. With natural hair, it really needs to air dry straight or have a lot of heat and low fan/wind to effectively straighten to a smooth blow out. Otherwise it just frizzes too quick and burns hair unnecessarily, or the lack of heat doesn't leave it that smooth. Unfortunately, this blow dryer had a lot of bark but no bite. It was loud, felt powerful, but the temperature and fan combinations were not optimal. Either too much wind or too little heat. I just gave up after 1 section of hair and went back to my CHI Turbo, which is consistent in its results but can sometimes get TOO hot. For the record, I have used T3, CHI, and JRS Superstar Blow Dryers, all work well, and that is the point of reference that I am comparing it to. If you have relaxed or straight hair that doesnt require a lot of heat to get a smooth finish, you may like this dryer.",1
2,"Should not be called Kanon because it is not the same product from 1995 or so.  Not recommended, look elsewhere.",1
1,There was no GOLDEN.  It was dark brown.  No info on how to return.  Was way to dark for my daughters hair.  Not the color of the picture.,1

1,"This product will stain your clothing, warning is in small print.  Use carefully, as I ruined two shirts.  Stain did not show up until after the clothes were washed.  Also the spray is wide.  As such, a lot of the product is wasted.  Not sure of a replacement product, but I will not use this product if I am wearing any clothes I would not want to ruin.",1
1,most were broken,1
1,"I'm not one of those types who writes terrible reviews for fun and picks apart the tiniest insignificant details of every product.  But this product absolutely fell apart, so I can't help but warn others!  First of all, unless you have a perfectly smooth, plastic shower surround, the suction cups will never work.  I have a smooth tile shower and they don't even work on mine.  So I bought this mirror because it was one of the few that came with this \\""waterproof\\"" sticky tape.  That fell off too.  I finally just bought some Gorilla glue and that held the mirror to the wall.  Then a few days later, the mirror itself came unstuck from the frame.  And guess what!  It was just more of this waterproof tape holding the mirror on.  No wonder it failed.  Because this was a Christmas gift and the box was thrown out on Christmas day, I couldn't get a refund from J&R.  They're sending me a replacement, which I'm hoping will not fall apart as well.",1
2,"I found this product way too oily and it wouldn't set well at all. It just left a greasy feeling and wouldn't stay put. Unless you have dry skin that can hold it, you'll need a lot of powder to make it stay.",1

1,"First off, I cut my thumb trying to remove the battery cover.  After inserting  4 new AA batteries as directed I was disappointed to find the unit did not turn on. They advertise this product at nearly $100. I got it for a very low price on another site, but it is now worth zero to me. I am very disappointed and have asked for a refund.<br />Now, the next day, in bright daylight, I see that there are two marks in black on the black handle that I did not see last night. THE UNIT DOES NOT TURN ON IF YOU PRESS IN THE MIDDLE. YOU MUST PRESS AT THE TOP ON THE MARK THAT YOU CAN BARELY SEE....THE OTHER MARK THAT YOU CAN BARELY SEE WILL TURN IT OFF.HOPING THAT I WILL LIKE THE PRODUCT NOW AFTER AN HOUR OF FRUSTRATION LAST NIGHT......",1
1,"I had a fabulous color called sandy beige which matched my incredibly stunning complexion to perfection. Sadly, It was discontinued and my world slipped into the abyss of bad foundation choices. Lo and behold I found these on Amazon and the heavens opened up and all was right in the world. Until they sent me two bottles of a color called Gobi Berry by mistake. Yes I could have returned them and hoped they would find the right shade but I didn't and I tried the Gobi Berry and looked like Tan Mom without the 15 minutes of fame and the troubled daughter. I have no one to blame but myself.",1

Takes three times as long, winds up being much more irritable to my skin because of all the rubbing back and forth, and the hairs come back in a couple weeks.  I used my old Epilady about every three months because the hairs were so light!  Don't believe that 5-star review just because you want to.

2,"I purchased this having used Sephora's perfecting eye primer for a couple years. While the Mary Kay does make eyeshadow last longer, it does not brighten the eye the way Sephora does. Also, it doesn't feel silky and smooth; it feels heavy and draggy when you put it on. Threw it away after two uses and won't purchase again.",1
1,it hurts wrist and hand bones. good idea but need to make better fit strings. strings are too tight and ball is very firm,1
1,"Doesnt work well for a day to day brush cleansing.  I was hoping to find something similar to the MAC cleanser for day to day wipes,in between my full washes.  This product barely works and is not worth the money",1
2,I didnt like some of the ingredients in it.  I try to stay away from fluoride and also fake sugars.,1
1,Looks like you put your finger in a socket.  It doesn't fit well at all. Runs small.  Very disappointed in this wig.  Will not buy again from this seller.,1
2,This did not work well for me unfortunately. I still have flaking and scale build up from psoriasis with little difference.  It doesn't smell badly like many other treatment shampoos but it just didn't work and made my hair rather dry.  I guess it's back to the expensive prescription shampoo for me.,1

Less than a year after purchase, the top part is not heating very well at all.  The auto shut off feature keeps coming on and staying on.  Not very happy since I wanted a professional flat iron and paid this much to have one. Would not buy another GHD even though my hair stylist recommended this brand....",1

No.  But advertise it for what it is.  If you are selling it, you should know the difference.",1

2,"When I first purchased this Philips Norelco shaver, I thought my days of driving to the supermarket for a Mach 3 were over. The product worked fine, and I did not have major complaints outside of acquiring a beard trimmer. As time passed, I noticed a major problem, but not too extreme.<br /><br />The shaver foil on the trimmer popped out of its compartment, and I could not put it back in place.<br /><br />Next, I wondered why - at least - a couple of blades weren't purchased when I bought the razor. So, I purchased another shaver foil with the thought of the previous problem as a fluke. Then, the second foil had a crack, which as we know, another replacement is needed.<br /><br />I purchased another foil and the same things happened as the previous foil.<br /><br />And, this made me wonder...are they building the foils to fail? And so, is this the money maker for this product? Its like the jean designers who build jeans only to have the back-bottom ends of the pants to rip so another pair needs purchasing.",1

2,Too much hair. The look on line does not match what I received. I will keep the item but will not purchase another at this time.,1
1,"When I first started using this, I liked it because my skin felt great afterwards, when it normally feels really tight. It also seemed to help clear my skin. But with continued use, it started to burn my skin a lot which usually doesn't even sting with harsh face washes...and I also started to develop a lot of cystic acne which I believe is from this face wash because I never get the cystic type. It might work for someone with extremely dry skin, as long as said person doesn't get the sting effect.",1
1,Actually accidentally ordered the wrong one cause I usually get the Herstyler type.  This one had a not so pleasant odor to it.,1
2,"The holder itself is great the stone fell apart after using it 5 times,it started it come apart after the 3rd use and then it fell apart as I was using it the 5th time,needs stronger glue if you use it with water which that is what it is for.",1

1,"Bought this at target. Read good reviews about it and decided to buy. I was really disappointed in the eyeliner (both sides). The liquid eyeliner side was very dry and hard to apply since I practically had to drag it back and forth across my eyelid. The liquid side smudges almost instantly across the upper eyelids and further down around the eye area in just a couple of hours. Although it does not claim to be water-proof, just the tiniest amount of liquid makes the eyeliner run. The kohl eyeliner is not very pigmented. I was expecting an intense black but the color was barely even black. Don't waste your money with this product.",1
1,it didn't work,1
2,"This stuff didn't do much for my hair. Too many chemicals. Try weledas rosemary oil instead. I have super dry brittle blonde dyed hair and the rosemary oil seriously conditions it and improves the texture like you wouldn't believe. This stuff not so much. My hair felt dry, looked dry, frizzy and worse. Save your money... Try rosemary oil or coconut oil. Shampoo hair, put rosemary oil in hair thoroughly focusing on the ends. Put shower cap on, leave in for 2+ hours, then rinse shampoo and condition as usual. You will not regret it!",1

1,"The original amber was wonderful! I bought several bottles at a time.  When I finally ran out, I bought this version.  It's horrible.  It gave me an asthma attack.  It seems they cheaped out for the \\""new version.\\""  This is mostly synthetic scents and alcohol.  I'm very saddened.",1
2,Nothing special as portrayed. Basic depilatory cream.,1
2.0,"The picture is deceiving! It looks like a beautiful simple crown, sitting flat on a flat surface, which is exactly what I was looking for but that was not the case when I opened the package. It has hair prongs on the back, which my daughter HATES! The tiara itself is beautiful but unfortunately my little princess won't even touch it. I n fact the other day I found it in her garbage.",1

Today I was running late for work and decided to give it a go.  I showered but ignored my hair and instead opted to grab the dry shampoo.<br />Thought I perfectly followed the directions, instead of a light, healthy head I instead looked like someone dumped flour on my head! I couldn't brush it out or rub it in per the instructions which lead to ANOTHER shower just to wash this out of my hair.<br />Terrible waste of my time and money.",1
2,"Pros:<br />Lower settings felt nice on my gums and I am sure it cleaned off the more easy-to-remove particles from my teeth.<br />Was a good way to rinse the gaps around my implant and I could tell water was getting under the gums in that area due to the larger gap between the implant and my gum tissue.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Medium setting really hurt my gums and the soft tissues of my mouth so I had to turn it back to low.<br />Water got absolutely everywhere in the bathroom. EVERYWHERE. The counter was covered in water spray.<br />This thing is very noisy. I read reviews on other models which look similar, but white, and some people said they had quiet operation. So who knows, maybe I was unlucky? But I would feel very embarrassed to try to use this living with a roomate. It would definitely wake someone up in the morning.<br />I did two passes over my teeth, so basically 'flossed' twice. Then I used my regular dental floss to see what was left. Well, it seemed like I never even flossed because my regular floss removed pretty much the normal amount of stuff that I am used to seeing. My teeth are very close together so maybe that's why?<br /><br />I am returning this item tomorrow because I really can't see that it works for me. I can see how it might benefit people who don't have the hand dexterity to use normal floss, because at that point at least it would be better than using nothing. Sorry!",1

2,"When working with electricity on clients I want to feel secure. I also own a SonoPeel and it's buttons are much easier and not flimsy like these. Water can easily get into the unit, even being very careful as I am. There are better models on the market, but the price increases with quality.",1
1,I am glad I did not spend a lot of money on this product.  There was no noticeable difference.  I wouldn't buy it again.,1
2,"The item itself is wonderful..! Really durable. Most comments state the skull or diamonds fell off when received, but mine was perfectly fine. I bought it as a gift for my sister, she loves it! The reason why I am rating it with two stars is because I ordered 3 and only received 1. They were really fast in refunding me my money, as I requested.",1
2,I love the lotion because of the fresh smell and feel...but the soap has neither the tingly feel or the fresh smell...it does have lovely lather though. AND the shipping was way too expensive for one bar of soap!,1

I have gone through the full charge and try to do a trim at least 5 times and have never made it yet. Remmington has a policy of not taking anything back unless it has not been taken out of the package and used. How am I supposed to find out if it works without taking it out of the package? This is the second Remmington product I have purchased over the years and both have been very poor. No more Remmington for me!",1

But I am more of a Ralph by Ralph Lauren or Be Delicious by DKNY fan. This is too heavy, musky and &#34;old lady&#34; for me.",1
1,"This trimmer is a joke!   First of all it's cordless and it takes a whole lot of energy to run those blades, but philips guys decided to make a brake through and added a vacuum system that helps to kill that already poor battery! Conclusion: either the accumulator should be improved or get rid of the vacuum!  Second, one cannot get a close cut! Min. length that you can get is 2.5 mm , so think twice if it's enough for you!  Third, yes it looks good on the picture, but not in reality! It feels really cheap in one's hand. At first, I thought that it would be steel or some sort of a solid material, wroooong. Cheap plastic!   Hope it's helpful!",1

This is the first time that I have seen a reaction like this on her since she has been born.<br /><br />Stick with the ultra gentle stuff until baby is old enough to use stronger products.

The foil is now like a snowflake pattern and the blades are are flat as opposed to the older more uniform pattern and tapered blade.<br /><br />I tried it out for a few weeks and am not happy with the results. I can still feel the stubble on my skin every-time i touch my face.  In fact the cut seems to be worse than my old style foil/blade thats 6+ years old!<br /><br />I'm not sure why this foil/blade is getting great ratings, maybe its cause they never tried the older version?

The packaging was not calculated to sustain any rough treatment. The clip isn't very well made, i don't think it will hold up to much. It came from China. I wouldn't recommend purchasing from this dealer.",1
1.0,"I was really excited to get this product, and yes, compared to a drugstore or Sally's Beauty I did save a lot of money.  Unfortunately, before I even received them in the mail I saw this exact product at every Dollar Tree in LA!  You can get multiple different types of glitter and tinsel and shapes in packs of 8 (obviously for a dollar.  I was sad and felt ripped off, but now I know better.  They also have nail polish pens.  The only things I haven't been able to find there are rhinestones, nail tape, and the dotters.",1
1,"I read the reviews on Amazon and on Target.com (Target's reviewers gave it a lower average).  I did not want to buy it, but after visiting three nearby stores, it became apparent that this was the only 1.5\\"" curling iron that I could have if I wanted it that day (which I did).  The other negative reviews were right.  Yes, the curling iron does get hot, quickly, and it could potentially curl your hair... if you don't accidentally turn it off while rolling your hair, and if you don't need to hold onto the tip, and if you don't burn your fingers.<br /><br />The comment about the on/off switch being too easily depressed during normal curling - TRUE.  The comment about the tip being too hot - TRUE (in case you thought you'd grip the tip to avoid gripping the handle, thereby turning the iron off while curling.).  Nobody has mentioned the shape of the tip... it is a dome shape and ribbed so that your fingers slide right off the end.  Unless of course, you grip a little closer to the handle.  Then your fingers will slide right onto the 400 degree hot curling surface.  And worst of all... if you use it on heat setting #4 or #5, YOU WILL RADIATE THE SMELL OF BURNED HAIR - ALL DAY LONG.<br /><br />My last 1.5\\"" curling iron was a Conair Instant Heat which retails for about half and worked well for several years.  I'm getting that one again.",1

1,"I loved this when I first bought it. But after a week or two, it begin acting like a Diva! I changed the batteries and it was fine for a day or two. I've changed the soap (even though it wasn't completely empty). It still won't work. That red light keeps coming back on. I did a little research online & cannot find a solution, so it's going in the trash! I guess I'll spend a little more money for one of those fancier ones. Lysol - you were no help either. Your website had complaints, but no one on your team responded. So I'm guessing there is not troubleshooting to fix this, so I won't be buying any more refills!",1

The box was dirty. It was disgusting. My fiancé who even HATES my makeup obsessions was upset for me and said it was a rip off .. I want to request a refund but idk how since this is all sold out from the seller. I'm so disappointed in this purchase. I wonder if the other Shany products have poor quality. Oh well.

1,"I buy many organic products and natural products but this one its the worst. When I used it the first time in the shower it was sticky and it did not spread well. Had to use a lot to cover my entire body. Since I was wet it just fell of and did not do much but to leave a sticky film on my body. After rubbing and rubbing to remove it I had to wash myself about 3 times with soap to remove the sticky film. Also my natural soap would not even lather when trying to remove it, that is why it took 3 times to completely take it off. Also it left a shea butter smell in my skin for two days. Tried to use it another time in dry skin and it did scrub my body a little better but still had the sticky film all over.<br />I have used better organic and natural products than this one. Do not buy unless you want to feel like flipper in the bathroom.",1
1,I was so excited to get this because I had read good reviews. Well I had read bad ones too but didnt  believe it. I should've listened!! Bottle came 2/3 full and I thought this a lip STAIN?  It only stained the brush but not my lips. SO DISAPPOINTED!,1
1,But I am not satisfied with my purchase at all. It doesn't seem to be the same product I've bought previously. I didn't notice the (CA Formula) until I read the invoice when it arrived. I thought I was getting a great deal on the 16.9 oz bottle but it's a waste. I would not recommend whatever this CA formula is and get the normal stuff. I really like the normal stuff and will be purchasing from somewhere else in the future.,1

1,"Let me first say I was skeptical of this product before ordering it.  I have been battling hair loss for 5 years and have tried various different things.  I should note that I did experience success using brand name Avodart.  But due to extremely high cost and sexual side effects I was desperate to seek out a topical alternative.  Which lead me to Revivogen.  After using for 3 months and doing lots of internet research I have come to the conclusion that this product is useless and bordering on a scam.  First off the product DID NOT do anything to slow or regrow hair for me.  But more importantly what I found on the net is discouraging.  I will list out my reasons for this below...<br /><br />1.  Topical Absorption - Yes, Revivogen does have an impressive ingredient list.  Most of these products have been shown in a lab to have some anti-androgen properties.  The key thing to understand here is \\""in a lab\\"".  There is no scientific evidence whatsoever that these ingredients will lower DHT in a human body, LET ALONE if they are applied topically.  There are many things that have systemic effects when taken orally but have no efficacy at all when used topically.  This can be seen in many vitamins as well as spirinolactone which is an extremely powerful anti-androgen.  However, as many hair loss sufferers have discovered it has no effect used topically.  Moving on...<br /><br />2.  Where are the good reviews? - Revivogen has been around for some time and if it is as effective as they claim there should be lots of internet success reviews backing this up.  I have scoured the net and at best have come up with people saying they \\""think it works\\"" or it \\""should work\\"" based on it's ingredients.  You'd think on sites like Amazon there would be lots of people backing this product.  When I did come across positive reviews they appeared to be fake and scripted.  Which is something I will address next.<br /><br />3.  Duplicate reviews - In searching the net for reviews on Revivogen I found one website that had an abundance of them.  I won't name the site but it sounds very similar to \\""Follicle\\"".  This website has 60+ reviews for the product with an average of 3.5 out of 5 stars.  I read every one.  People either are very enthusiastic about this product and encourage people to keep using it because it takes time, or they hate it and call it a scam.  I wasn't sure what to think.  Then I noticed that there were 4 duplicate reviews.  What I mean by this is there were 4 reviews with identical reviewer names and locations but that each had very different positive reviews.  Oops Revivogen, you messed up either by human error or by programming your bot incorrectly.  This CLEARLY shows someone is trying to boost the amount of positive reviews Revivogen has on the website by using fake reviews.  Who do you think is doing it?  I doubt it's a customer who loves their product so much they decided to fake a bunch of positive reviews for them.<br /><br />4.  2 more things - These next to points are more speculation but are worth noting.  It has been said (though I haven't found it) that Revivogen has made claims on their website that their product is endorsed by the talk show host of the Bald Truth.  A quick search on the Bald Truth's website finds a response to this by the host saying a very long time ago he thought natural topical DHT inhibitors might have some effect but now he does not believe this at all and that he does not endorse their product and that he is surprised they would say so.<br /><br />Secondly I located a website which reviewed Revivogen and addressed the issue of topical absorption not likely working.  Now when you go to the article it is a greyed out with a note saying the article has been removed because they received pressure to remove it.  Who would pressure them to remove it?  And why?  I think the answer is obvious.<br /><br />In closing I want to address that some of you will say that if the product doesn't work then they would have gone out of business.  Think about it, with all the men everyday for the first time noticing they are losing hair all they need to do is convince you to buy their product once or a few times.  After milking you for several hundred dollars before you give up there is a whole new customer base ready to throw out a few hundred in cash.  It's an endless cycle.<br /><br />I wish all of you the best of loss in your hair loss battle.  But I hope this review will help you to move on to more effective/proven solutions rather than waste your money and precious time.n everyday for the first time noticing they are losing hair all they need to do is convince you to buy their product once or a few times.

2.0,"Didn't help me, I didn't like it!",1
1,The description is misleading! For the price you would expect six boxes not one box with six patches.  This is a obscene price for this item which usually retails for $6 in-store.,1
1,"NOT PLEASED WITH FLAT IRON, VERY CHEAPLY MADE, DOES NOT GET REAL HOT, DOES NOT STRAIGHTEN HAIR WELL ,  VERY TIME CONSUMING TO STRAIGHTEN HAIR  DUE TO IT NOT WORKING WELL OR DOING THE PURPOSE . WILL NEVER PURCHASE AGAIN I DON'T RECOMMEND IT.",1

2.0,"Excellent product for such a great price. Hearts well, folds even better! Impressed.   UPDATE...   After using it maybe once a month (4-5 times since purchase) the retractable cord no longer works. Very surprised because it seemed like a pretty good product.

2,"A little over a year ago, my teenage daughter insisted that she had to use a clinical deodorant because the \\""other\\"" deodorants did not work sufficiently & allowed her to perspire even when just doing basic school stuff (class change, lunch chat, etc).  She had been using Ban [[ASIN:B000GCE99U Unscented Invisible Solid Antiperspirant Deodorant by Ban, 2.6 Ounce]].<br /><br />She has now tried 4 different clinical deodorants and, despite the fact that they all contain the same active ingredient - Aluminum Zicronium Tetrachlorohydrex GLY 20% , she has declared that 2 brands are heroes & 2 brands are zeros.<br /><br />The losers:  Suave Clinical & Dove Clinical<br />The winners: Degree Clinical & Secret Clinical<br /><br />Why?  Even after wearing all of the brands multiple times, she cannot tell you why she thinks one brand works better than the others.  We looked at ingredients, application, and activity level.  There was no rhyme or reason.  She continued to feel that Degree & Secret kept her drier.  Her verdict was that her results with the Suave & Dove brand were the same as her results with Ban (Aluminum Zicronium Tetrachlorohydrex GLY 19%).<br /><br />Of the 2 different Suave Clinical deodorants tried, she preferred the powder fresh scent over the everlasting sunshine scent (which was deemed, \\""yuck\\"").<br /><br />Verdict:  if you need a clinical deodorant, go with Degree or Secret.",1
2,"Had high hopes for the sponge given the reviews on the website. But after using it for two weeks straight I have seen no noticeable change in my skin. I still have the same number of blackheads and the same kind of dirt, and I still break out. No major change. Pretty disappointing!",1
1,Only received three different types. Two cheap Australian gold varieties and the hot legs from California tan. Picture is very very misleading.,1
1,The shaft on this brush is made of plastic and will break upon use. I do not recommend it. The brush would be much better if the shaft were made of wood.,1
2.0,"Just OK. A lot of people rhapsodize about the smell, but I thought that it kind of smelled like the chemicals in a salon. Shaves OK, but there are so many better soaps out there for not much money, I can't really recommend this.",1
1,"Terrible tool was a waste of time, it can't be easily used and also was delivered 3 weeks after the date set via US mail.

2.0,Not as effective as I thought.,1

I dont know if its authentic or not since I have nothing to compare it to but i look GRAY AND PALE> I have light to medium skin with yellow undertones, this looks so bad as if i have sun screen on:( Very disappointed that it doesn't come in different colors. I waited 5 hrs for it to re adjust (apparently the color readjusts??) but nope...I still look gray at the end of the day",1
2,"Didnt worked for me, wasnt sharp enough as others have pointed !! Can only use once plus it doesnt give me a close shave",1
2,The nail stickers kept breaking as I would try to gently peel them off of the sticker. I never had the problem when I bought them from a store like Target or CVS so I will stick to buying nail stickers in stores now.,1
2.0,Made my scalp break out. I think its the copper. I tried a copper product once same thing happened. Should make one that is copper free.<br />I think the Biotinyol Tripeptide 1 is the key ingredient that makes this work. I would be happy if had less and more of the main.,1
2,"I used this along with the Alba Honeydew Nourishing Hair Wash (shampoo). Used together, both products worked fine for the first few days. After about a week, however, I started noticing a buildup that was making my hair look and feel matted. I continued use for another week or two, hoping that my hair would adjust, or hoping that perhaps I just needed to rinse a bit longer in each shower. The buildup continued to worsen, however, to the point when I absolutely could not use the products any longer. I would have really loved to love this product, with all its natural ingredients and its lack of harmful chemicals. Until they find a way to prevent this buildup, however, I'll just have to stick with my expensive Pureology.",1
2,"Looking for a miracle for age spots/sun spots. I noticed in my mid thirties, after having a baby that my once pretty skin had gone to ughh. I have very noticeable dark spots and splotches, and was hoping that this product would be the cure, but no such luck. I used it for over a month and saw absolutely no difference. Also the smell is too strong and actually gives me headaches sometimes. So if you have a sensitivity to smells beware.",1
1,This was a waste of money . Basically it looked like someone sprinkled different color glitter into tiny containers and called it a day.,1
2,One of the threads that holds it shut cracked off very easily in the 2nd week. It still closes and is fine otherwise.,1

It would buzz for a split second at most.<br /><br />These brushes are the newer, made in China brushes, and just aren't made to last. Definitely, one of my worst purchases purchases. I would rate the brush lower, if Amazon allowed me to.<br /><br />Also, I spoke to customer service, and since I didn't keep the receipts, they would only offer me a $10 discount for each brush. I was disappointed, considering how expensive these brushes sell for.",1
1,"I might as well use water.  It smelled great at first, and now there's not even a fragrance.  I bought two other bottles, just to see if I had not correctly sealed the first.  This was a scent I'd been looking for.  I might as well use tap water.  NOT worth the trouble!",1

2,"I don't like this product and I don't think it works any better than other similar products. I've tried it and it goes on cakey even when you use the gloss.

1,"I was looking for a more natural cleaner for my hair and I'm really sad to say (If I don't like something I won't rate it) it was bad enough that I need to let others know.  Maybe its my hair type, but it just wasn't good, my hair felt grimy.",1

I watched the video CD first. It is recommmended you use small sections, and I did... it wasn't for me, but the store allowed me to return it. It may work for you. Think of the automatic roller brush (as seen on TV), it works for some people, and they like it.",1
2,This is the first time I've tried a waxing product and I think I follow the directions exactly but was not at all pleased with the results. It did not remove most of the hair on my upper lip. I did read instructions and reviews that say it will not remove short hair but it didn't even remove the longer hairs. I tried several times and just was not happy. It is also sticky and messy. I think the product may be fine for a salon or an experienced user. This is not for me! I contacted Amazon for a return and although this item is not eligible for return they promptly refunded me. Great customer service as always from Amazon.,1

2,Really doesn't erase fine lines.,1
1,"Lustray Bay Rum has nearly zero scent. The little scent that it does have is gone before you know it. It probably does cleanse cuts but it's not much of a bay rum. Seriously, it's like rubbing alcohol and brown dye. Clubman's Virgin Island Bay Rum is much better. Why Clubman risks it's reputation by putting it's name on this, is beyond me. I know it's not technically a \\""Clubman Product\\"", but the tag next to it did say \\""Lustray Bay Rum BY CLUBMAN \\"". You know? Anyway, Clubman products are my favorite so I took a chance on it. Lustray Bay Rum is just not good. Period.",1

1,"Biore towelettes have a surprisingly rough nobby texture (like cheap rough TP) which combined with the astringent-like liquid is just too much for the face. The liquid stings my eyes badly. Not a good product for sensitive facial skin or eyes, but in order to use them up, I'll use them on my feet. The fragrance is very clean and fresh, but that is the only good thing about this product.",1
1.0,Unfortuantely I spent money on something that had absolutely no use. My polish would not transfer the stamp onto the stamper. I tried many of the different designs hoping that I would get at least one but I never did. I would not recomment purchasing stamps from this company.,1
2,"Point end is good, but push end is angled to harsh making it very thin and sharp. Also, needed sanding as mine are all ready to give you a splinter.

1,"\\""In some cases, rinses may cause surface staining to teeth. This is not permanent or harmful, and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit.\\"" This warning appears on the bottle in very small print (and in the Amazon listing). I do not understand why Crest would sell a dental product that makes teeth look WORSE! My daughter was already self-conscious about teeth that are not white and decided to step up her dental care with more brushing, flossing, and mouthwash. I trusted the Crest name and did not read this tiny warning when I bought the rinse. After 2 weeks of use, she figured out that the brown color on her teeth coincided with the time she started using this product. We threw it out and have made an appointment for an extra cleaning at her dentist.  An internet search shows that complaints like this go back to at least 2008 - yet the product has not been changed. DON'T USE THIS STUFF!",1
2,Returned item/  It was too small.,1
1,No good quality,1
1,"Bought this one and it worked fine for a little less than two months, never mistreated and always well kept, but it decided to die on me.

Guess I'll be looking to give these away. Unfortunate.",1
1,"I was so hopeful when I ordered this product, and now I am so disappointed. As soon as it arrived, I popped it open and squirted the back of my throat once. I was shocked and horrified at the taste and the long-lasting aftertaste. I cannot comment on how it works for a tired throat, and I'll never find out for myself, because the taste of this product is so vile that I will never use it.<br /><br />Prior reviews did not scare me off of purchasing Singer's Saving Grace. I'm not usually bothered by odd smells or tastes, and I'm a grown-up, right? I can take it, right? Well, I can't. It was truely awful, just as the mom in the \\""bummer\\"" review tried to warn me...",1

Her package arrived collapsed, which damaged the potpourri inside. In addition, the safety foil around the body lotion was missing and the bottle was 1/2 empty and very clearly tampered with.<br /><br />NOT ONLY IS THIS A DISAPPOINTMENT, BUT ALSO A HYGIENE ISSUE!!!

1,"Even though this new filter looks very much the same as the original, it seems to work better.  So sensitive!  I sprayed the shower with a Lysol spray last week and that bathroom is at the back of the house.  The air had to pass out of the bathroom at least 12 ft. to the door, all the way down our bedroom which is at least 24 ft. long, through my office (another 8 to 10 ft.)  and into the living room and cross about 12 ft. to reach the filter.  Not only did the filter detect the spray, but it had the strongest possible reaction to it.  Stayed that way for hours.  These filters are wonderful.  Don't hesitate to buy, if you need one.",1

2,I bought this for my clients. I figured it was worth a try especially for the price. Sadly the pigmentation is simply not there in 90% of the glosses. Though they all have great shine. It isn't something I would repurchase and I wouldn't recommend it.,1

2,Unfortunately the puff is the only thing i can use.  The dish came broken.,1
1,Disappointing - why would an antioxidant product contain denatured alcohol (aka SD Alcohol)?  Take a look at an MSDS sheet and you'll see that denatured alcohol is not something you want to put on your skin.  This would be a great product without the alcohol.,1
1,"As someone who sought out this product relentlessly at pharmacies and beauty boutiques...I was excited to find it here. I had a pair of interlocking combs I paid $5.00 for back in the 90's. I was expecting (maybe at my own fault) that being \\""interlocking\\"" there would be 2 for the price. I awaited it excitedly. To my disappointment, I opened this box filled with packing peanuts to find a single comb. I can not \\""interlock\\"" 1 comb. I was very disappointed. Oh yea...It also came as a black comb, not \\""Tortoise Clear\\""",1
1,"I have to admit, I am really sensitive to strong fragrances, so I really shouldn't try to buy this type of product online, but it sounded like the scent was from natural sources, which is the exact type of product I like to use. Well.... this does NOT smell like roses at all!!! I found the smell VERY similar to Patchouli oil, which I cannot stand. If you like that sort of fragrance, than you'll LOVE this conditioner. I only used it once, but it didn't seem to be especially moisturizing, although, even if it was the best conditioner I'd ever used, I would NEVER use it again because of the strong stinky fragrance ~ Peee-U!",1
2,"I only blow dry my hair straight about once a week.  Although I liked the blowdryer, I've had blowdryers last years.  I went through 2 in 2 years.  So:  Not so good.",1
2,Not as powerful as the 2000. Didn't heat or blow adequately on high probably defective unit. Returned.,1
1,mediocre,1
1,Sad not just I want real. I would like to return stuff,1
1,so i saw SO many good things bout this perfume even in a magizine.. to me it smells like black licorice.. i dont like it one bit. the bottle is BEAUTIFUL and its so cute too bad it stinkjs to me :(but i lke very prety smells or sweet and ths was neither. it smellled like something my mom would like. im 20 yrs old and i thought it was too mature for me,1
2.0,"These didn't seem as sharp out of the box&#34; as other Gillette throw a ways that I have bought in the past. Hard to say if it's were they were made or ?  Got less shaves out of each razor too. I'll try a different brand next time, could be that Gillette going down hill.",1
2,"I normally love this product, but some of the tubes were pretty dry.  I don't know if these tubes were just to old.",1
1,Not impressed at all. You can get the same type of product for MUCH cheaper.,1
2,"Pros:  The product does what it claims and gets rid of product build up.  It really gets your hair \\""squeaky\\"" clean so if you have a lot of product build up, then this will definitely get the job done and remove it.<br /><br />Cons:  However, this product stripped my hair of critical moisture and nutrients and ultimately damaged my hair even though I followed the directions and used the recommended amount.<br /><br />Overall, I have mixed feelings about the product.  It does what it claims but I would use caution using it.  I definitely would not recommend this product for processed or fine hair.  I would suggest doing a test area to make sure that it doesn't damage your hair.",1
1,All this does is scratch you and give you red marks/bumps. I can do the same with my fingernails. Returned this item.,1
2,Not authentic,1
2,"This cost about $130 new. Now I see that it is less, but the warranty is for two years and mine broke pretty much exactly after two years. This means you will pay $50-$65 a year for a toothbrush. It did a good job while it worked, but I am disappointed that mine suddenly stopped working without any real cause.",1
1,"Just because it has oil in it doesn't mean it has to be an oily product. I returned it, won't be buying it again.",1
2,The size of the HEAD is TOO small to work effeciently.  The overall quality of the devise is of good construction and material.,1
1,"I needed the head holder which I thought was included with this one, this should properly be labeled replacement blades.",1
1.0,"It tastes like soap, hardly foams at all and is not creamy at all.  I think I just paid for soapy water!",1
2,Not happy.  Received the wrong color hair.  I would not recommend this retailer.,1
1,"I've used the Just For Me Texture Softener for about a year now, and was initially, very satisfied with the product. But I found with my most recent purchase (4/11/15) that they changed the formula. This product used to just soften the curl of my hair, but this last application completely straightened it. It also REALLY irritated my scalp -- something that the old formula never did. Even the conditioner is different; the new stuff didn't leave my hair soft like the old formula did. If you're looking for a gentle texture softener, look elsewhere. BTW, the new packaging has a white background with slightly older girls pictured as compared to the old product which is pictured on the Amazon page (yellow background with younger girls). And nowhere on it do they mention a change in the formula.",1
2,"I didn't see any difference between this gel and less expensive ones. I have thick, wavy/loose curly hair and this curling balm felt heavy and my curls turned hard.",1
1,Easy to break when You try in the HAIR and the sheeping was to later its bad quality. Dont WILL buy again,1
1,"I bought this for my wife.  She likes to wear this fragrance for work and everyday activities. I usually purchase this item at Macy's for $75.  So I thought this was a bargain.  That was a big mistake.  My wife was not pleased with the aroma.  She thought that this must be stock that was lost and recently found and that's why the price was so CHEAP!  She described it as musty, tired, indefinite, indistinct, obscure, opaque, pale, shadowy, unclear, undefined, undetermined, vague, aged, and unyoung. DO NOT BUY unless you like your Eau De Parfume STALE, FAINT AND OLD!",1
2,I was definitely not impressed with this product. The quality of the hair was very cheap looking and it sheaded too much. Such a waist :(,1
2,"The moisturizer in the last two jars has been runny. It seems like an old product. It doesn't seem like what I used to get which was never runny or thin, but thick and creamy.  I think I'll order directly from Swisa from now on.",1
2.0,Bought this product to send it to a family member who is in Afghanistan. Tried it but only lasted for less than 5 minutes . Not happy with this product. I won't buy this product anymore.,1
1,"The seller does not have a good return policy, so I'll have to chunk this pos product in the trash. I didn't read anything in the description regarding parabens.. not a good buy. I wouldn't recommend this product if you're trying to stay away from all those parabens.",1
1,It came a mess and is stiil a mess after giving to my beautician to fix.,1
1,Just picked up a package of 2 Bic flex 5 razors and have already broken one trying to get the cover off the blade now no luck with the other. Sure as hell shouldn't be this difficult. There is no instruction or diagram to refer to. It must something simple but got so frustrated I'm taking them back.,1
1,"Not crazy about this product, when it came some of it was not totally wrapped up almost like it was leaking and the smell of the shea butter was pretty awful. I don't see myself using any of this product which is unfortunate because i got 5 lbs of it.",1
1,junk!!,1
1,"I've never had an allergic reaction to makeup until I purchased this mascara. Shortly after I started using it, my eyelids started itching badly. After a few days, my eyes were swollen, itchy and my eyelids were wrinkly and flaky. I thought I just had an eye infection, so I stopped using eye makeup for a few days and it started to clear up. I was starting to suspect the mascara, so I tried it once more, and sure enough the symptoms came back. Be cautioned!",1
2.0,Arrived more than a week early but is very small and color is faded.,1
1,Product doesn't Evan work  was delivered broken,1
1,"This \\""treatment\\"" seemed like nothing more than regular conditioner in a fancy block container with an appealing label. This \\""treatment\\"" was extremely thin. I though it was going to be richer, creamier, and thicker. It was not at all.  And I actually slept with my hair saturated in this stuff. I rinsed it out in the morning, & I felt no difference in the texture of my hair. And if there was a difference, it was not noticeable to the naked eye.  Pantene conditioners are pretty good, but next time I will just stick to purchasing my conditioner in one of those longer slimmer bottles....its cheaper. :)",1
1.0,Made it soft but did not grow my hair.,1
1,I ordered this because I was replacing an existing one I had that was no longer in the stores.  Obviously Revlon changed the product because when it came the label was the same but it was completely different.  Mine was iridescent and this was just creme. The word &#34;Illuminance&#34; was misleading.,1
2,"I ordered this product so I could see a tooth I was having trouble with. Unfortunately, the mirror fogs up so quickly that I am unable to see the tooth for more than a couple of seconds",1
1,Did not work for me at all. Was a waste of money.,1
2,Kind of weak. Did not really color my nipples as expected,1
1.0,Really cheap material. I tried on first time and broke in less than five seconds. I was however able to reattach it on the next available link. Also reported it to the seller and the offered to send another one so that was very nice of them to honor their product. Other than that it is cute on if u can get it to stay put which is proving to be more difficult than expected.,1
2,My sister recommended it because her hair dresser used it on her.  It didn't work quite as well when a lay person tries to use it.,1
1,"I was given this as a gift, and was very excited...however, it didn't work. Tried multiple times to use it, and tested to make sure the blades were functioning...even still, it didn't get the job done. I'm looking for its replacement.",1
1.0,I am disappointed shampoo was only half of tube :(,1
1.0,The smell is way to strong :(,1
1,These are the worst clippers I have ever bought.I had a andis T-edger for ten years and never had any problems so I thought these will be an upgrade but they were not I had to return them.Find something else anything would be better.,1
1,My first one was so good. I gave it to my daughter and ordered another for me. It came and did not work at all. I sent it back and have NOT GOTTEN A NEW ONE NOR MY MONEY BACK.. i REALLY WANT A NEW ONE.,1
1,"I have been using this as advised for over a month now. It says 2-3 times a day on clean skin. Somedays I use it twice, some days I used it three times. I have not seen any even slight difference. Don't waste your money.",1
1,"I bought this because I was looking for a product that was not full of chemicals to help cover some of my ne grey hair. This product has such great reviews that I had very high hopes for it. I bought the really big can of the chestnut brown because I have long, very thick hair and I wanted to make sure I had enough for a good job. The product arrived and I had my mother come over to help me with the project. We mixed the henna following the instructions exactly. We began applying the mixture to my hair but the process was so messy that I had to kneel in the bath tub to contain the mess. We ended up having to stop twice to mix more because the recommended amount fell far short for full coverage of my hair. Good thing I bought the big can. It took well over an hour to coat my hair fully with the paste. I left the product on for two hours and during that time i used what product that was left to do my mothers short dark hair as well. Once it was time to wash it out we both found it extreamly difficult to get the product out of our hair. I had to stand in the shower and shampoo six times to get 90% of the grit out of my hair. The rest washed out over the next two days. The worst part of the entire experience was the fact that both my hair and my mothers hair had an obvious green tint to it after using this henna product. The green tint did finally fade away after a couple weeks. However, I went to have some highlights put in my hair yesterday and due to the henna process in my hair, the new highlights ( not henna highlights) turned green tinted as well.<br /><br />The paste once mixed up for use smells nice like fresh cut gass but the smell stays in your hair for weeks afterwards. Once the paste is applied to your hair it turns into a heavy thick seaweed type pack that is terribly messy.<br /><br />I would love to find a natural product that is chemical free and easy to use with good results, however this one fell far short of my expectations.",1
1,"I ordered your stuff and paid in full. The only thing I got was the hair piece. I want the rest of my stuff,I paid,I want it! I won't buy from you anymore. That's not good buisness practice.",1
1,These are NOT made by Smoothies as stated above.,1
2,"I bought this product since my kids have eczema it helps a lot unfortunately it went bad, the smell was terrible after 2 months of use and keep it in the dark closet obviously I didn't use it anymore and I purchase another brand. I don't know if they sell me an older bottle or what did I do wrong!!",1
1,"I bought this product during a major flare up, hoping it would help offer some natural relief. NONE! Used it for several days and no relief at all. The product is so tiny. I was almost out by weeks end. I guess I should have known better. The company's website is all words and no actual pictures of people who have had success with the product. Save your money and try something else.",1
2,I feel the product is very poor quality. The latches on the arms pop open easily. Doesn't have the sturdiness of a quality item.,1
2,"I wanted to like these, but my instincts about them were spot on. The blade lever is very cheap and flimsy. The clippers themselves are pretty average. The attachments are terrible. Very cheaply made and don't snap on very well. As far as the cutting ability, you can do better than this one. Overall, this is just a mediocre clipper set that I suspect would choke under regular use. Plus, if you're going to make a corded set of clippers, at least have the courage to show the cord in the product pictures and packaging. The minute a customer opens the box, they're going to see the cord, so why beat around the bush? It's just a silly marketing choice - if we don't show them the cord, they won't know it's there. Well, we know, or will shortly after opening the box, so you may as well just show it. Doubtful this would even be good for bets; the blades just aren't good enough. Solidly mediocre.",1
1,This shampoo does not work well. It does not clean you hair very good and leaves it hard. Will never buy again.,1
1,I go a random.... single roll as well. Extremely disappointed. I cannot believe how Amazon allows this type of posting.,1
1,"Everything seemed fine until I opened it and tried to use it but it was clumpy,like it had been an old or poorly made product.",1
2,The gel is fine but I was a bit upset that I recieved a busted container.,1
1,No good.  Gets mold really fast. Nasty.,1
2,"My main concern when purchasing this product, is the disappearance of the puffiness beneath my eyes. I have been using this product for nearly 2 weeks.  I still have the puffiness under my eyes and, as of this day, I can see to change!  Maybe with continued usage,  I will be able to see some results soon!",1
1,1.The color is completely off. The &#34;black&#34; is grey.<br />2. The curls are not waves as pictures<br />3. Extremely static-y<br />4. WIll never blend well with curled hair,1
1,"Worked for a few months and then it died.  Replaced the battery, no dice.  Cleaned the head unit, no dice.  Buy another Panasonic?  No dice.",1
1,"These were the best razors I have ever used.  These razors didn't cut or nick, and would last a very long time.  Now, as always, the manufacturer has decided that they need to reduce the quality to save a few pennies.  And the result is junk.  The old ones were a sort-of blue-green color.  the new ones are a more true green, like a forest-green.  They feel like the super-cheap razors in your hand, and they are not nearly as comfortable to use.  And, surprise, they don't last nearly as long as the old version.<br /><br />So I guess I'm done with these razors.  And to think, It's crossed my mind several times in the past that I should stock up, because one day they'll quite making these.  And that day has come.",1
2,"Personally, I don't like it. The smell is horrible and if it wouldn't of been on sale, i would not have bought it considering it is over priced. It only gets two stars because the shipping was fast.",1
1.0,Don't buy this if you are more than a C cup. It simply didn't work.  Would have been better off with duct tape.,1
1,I did not like this product.  I really wanted to and I tried to for two weeks even after it was driving me insane.  At first it was fine.  I used the products as they recommended.  After about three weeks my skin started to dry out.  It got so dry that after I washed my face I couldn't smile because my skin would crack and it would just look like a bunch of white dry skin.  That's been happening for three weeks now.  I stopped using the serums and just use a very diluted bit of clearing tonic and moisturizer. I'm probably putting moisturizer on about 5 or 6 times a day just to keep my skin from flaking and cracking.  It's been a total of about 5 or 6 weeks and all it's done is make my skin terribly dry.  I still break out.  I wouldn't recommend this product to a friend.,1
1,"I'D give ZERO MINUS stars if I could. The product was counterfeit.from this seller!! The bottle was gray and plastic where authentic Nu Skin AGELOC bottles and jars are some sort of metal and a Pearl color. The authentic product is great but I wouldn't TRY this on my face, who knows what's in it. The ingredients were all wrong too. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!",1
1.0,"For some reason the color photographed was not what I received. However, Palladia lip stain is wonderful! Discovered using a lip stain along with blistex medicated lip baln gives me perfect lips! No more regular lipstick for me.",1
1,"I ordered this set for my sister to give to her for Christmas.  I just received the package today and I have to say I'm not happy with what I got.  Not with the product itself, but with the condition the product was in.  The back left corner of the box was crushed in and slightly ripped.  And it wasn't UPS's fault because it was perfectly packaged and well protected.  Also, looking into the box I found two strands of hair inside.  So I don't know if Amazon sent me something damaged or something used, but with the condition it's in I'm not happy the slightest.  Most likely will return this and spend a little extra money on a set at Macys.  At least I know it will come in better condition.",1
1,"i got the same thing for both... -.- not even worth the time to return it; I wanted the natural ones too, but never happened",1
2,didn't arrive by the date it was said(+2 days) without notice. product is good.,1
2,"Irritated my gums.  Consequently, had to back off the pressure.  Would go with a different tip next time.",1
2,i was really dissapointed with this product. i really wanted the stain to turn out darker and it was much messier than the regular henna paste!,1
2,"not very big so doesnt hold as much hair as i expected, plus it does not hold the hair securely. a bit flimsy and deosn't quite do the job. would not refer this",1
1,"Bad smell, almost sour. Don't know if it is a knock off or not, but this is the second bottle that smells this way. Not happy!!",1
1,So as much as I dislike the Kryvaline Professional Face and Body Paint 12 essential colors I hate this product far more. The pink side has an almost glue like consistency. And no not because of to much water I paint with more of a dry style. Having only used this together as a rainbow effect you would think the paint usage would be even but not even close. There is a noticeable difference from side to side. The yellow to pick is far lower then the green and blue. I honestly had thought of sending it back I have never had such a terrible split cake before. At this point I am completely not happy with the Kryvaline line and having it be close in price to Tag or Diamond effect I'll stick what is proven consistent and effective for me.,1
1,I was not happy with this product. It did not cover the way I thought it should. The description of color was not accurate. It was much lighter than I thought. Beware of the size in ad. I didn't and was surprised at the size. It looks like a sample size to me.,1
1,Thought it would be waaaaaaaaaay bigger. And It's only HALF FULL!!!!!! never going to buy this again get what you pay for!,1
1.0,"These didn't  protect my manicure, instead of worrying about accidentally putting a small ding on a nail, now you'll worry about hitting these awkward clips into one of your nails and really destroying your manicure. The clips spin on your fingers and the hinges on the clips, hyper-extend and crush down on wet polish, plus, they're 2-3 times the size of your nails so you're 2-3 times as likely to hit them on something.  Sounds like a good idea, but save your money!",1
1,Fake!!  This is NOT Moroccan Oil Shampoo!<br />Do not purchase!  Does not even have the same color or texture or smell of the real Moroccan Oil Shampoo!!  Do not buy!!!,1
2,"I would probably not purchase this product again.  The product itself is great, but the packaging leaves something to be desired.  I gave one bottle to my sister and kept the other for myself.  After a few weeks we both noticed an unpleasant smell coming from the lid and dropper area.  I painstakingly cleaned the dropper and lid with bleach and that solved the problem for a few days and then it happened again.  I ended up just throwing them away",1
2,"My 12 year old put this on as the directions said, but ended up with a nasty sunburn. Hard to know if it's the sunscreen or user error - we didn't bother trying it again to find out.",1
1,I bought the 2 Oz. bottle of this stuff. I have used essential oils for years instead of cologne and because I just like it. So I feel that I am familiar with several venders and the smell associated with these essential oils. I would also add that I have taken courses at college which teach specifically about the properties which make an essential oil beneficial or aromatic. Most oils will burn your skin as they are volatile esters which vaporize at room temperature giving you the smell. They also are solvents which can absorb into the skin quickly and irritate some skin types. I have had some batches burn more than others due to the content of volatile compounds or even melt some plastics. They do however share some properties that make them unique and beneficial. So I ordered this opened it and was pissed...I cannot stress to you enough that this smells like a fresh Goodyear tire...it's the only thing that comes to mind. If I search for it I might sense a little bit of a Myrrh scent but more anise than anything. So my conclusion is that this is not what was claim. I have bought ___ brands 20% essential which I don't like either and it smells more similar to that. Sorry it's just the plain truth and I don't know how anyone could buy it and not have the same opinion.,1
1,Product didn't promote hair growth. In fact it did the opposite so that sucks. I wouldn't recommend it nor would I buy again. I purchased the product back in 2012 and it's now 2014 and I still have a full bottle. I completely forgot about it.,1
1,"I bought this to replace the Lavender SPF 30 they used to make, which was their flagship product before the company was sold to Hain. This is a far less superior product. It is greasy and the oil separates from the cream daily. That never used to happen so it is messy as a result. They also charge $2 more for the \\""new improved product\\"". SPF 30 is all you really need anyway so this is not an improvement when you add the greasy feel, the $2 increase, and the overkill on SPF. Bottom line: I am looking for a new favorite sun product.",1
1,"This seller is selling fake cologne. I do not know how in the world AMAZON link their name with seller, somebody has to call me from AMAZON or the seller and refund me. This cologne has no fragrance practically it is water inside the bottle. Need refund and I want to return it back.",1
2,"Have purchased this product in store, but the product delivered to my house was not the same. Still works as an okay mascara, but nothing close to the real thing.",1
1,"Different then in the picture. I thought it was the original bottle as shown in picture. They sent a new version in a white bottle for the second time. So, I am stuck with it because they will not return the item. Very unhappy.",1
2.0,"I bought this with great hope for working magic on my daughter's tight, curly hair, but it doesn't work any better than the bottle of oil I bought for 3 bucks at the local beauty supply store.  It's good, just not any better to warrant the 22 dollar price difference.",1
1.0,Not worth it they don't stay on no matter what glue,1
1,The compact was loose in the box.  Not packed well at all.  When I opened the compact I got loose powder all over my clothes and it is basically unusable.,1
1,"I had used this Shampoo and Conditioner combo for about a week when I noticed that my head was itchy and I started seeing flakes. I have NEVER had problems with itchy scalp or dandruff before, but this gave me BOTH.  It has been misery.  Needless to say, this stuff will go right in the garbage.",1
1,I was expecting a bold scent like the Chez Bond but didn't smell anything. Very disappointed in the quality but you get what you pay for.,1
1,"I've been using this particular cologne practically everyday for the last three years; I bought several vials of it and know the fragrance well.  The container I purchased from this seller was NOT the same cologne!!!  Not even close.  I've bought colognes in the past that have expired and lost their potency, but this is basically apples against oranges.  For only $15, I'm not too upset, but if you're looking for actual Diesel Zero Plus cologne, that isn't what you're going to get.",1
1,Once I received this item it was not the same or as pretty as the picture. When attempted to return this item I was not allowed even though the barrette was still in the original package and unopened. Lousy product lousy company. If I could give less then one star I would.,1
2.0,Eh.  Doesn't work very well and takes a long time. I'll stick to messy waxing.,1
1,"As soon as I opened a package, the black ribbons taped around the hair band all became loose and fell apart.  It is not woth that I regret I purchased this item.",1
1,Not at all what I wanted it to be!!!! It broke when I tried to fluff it out........ Ended up making my daughter a veil. very  disappointed.,1
2,"It took forever to receive, The zipper was broken and it had a whole in it.  The backpack is cute too bad they didn't have better quality control and shipping!  Would not order again or recommend it.",1
1,"Fast delivery but expensive product, very short validity dates, expiration date, one month and above the liquid color does not correspond to their original color have products that I know. open box without protection Adesif, so I'm not sure that the creams do not have to change was to send, because as previously said their color does not match the original. So big doubt about this product. Very disapointed.",1
1,Too difficult to make nail shine...,1
2,"Didn't work well for me. I've tried nearly everything for my acne - and I had really high hopes for this product since others said it was great. It didn't break me out worse, but it definitely didn't help. Try something more natural - I always resort to Alba!",1
2,This product was FANTASTIC... until I broke out in an angry rash all over my body about 24 hours after I application. Try a patch first.,1
1.0,"What a piece of junk. Flimsy, plastic, etc... Arrived with a large scuff on surface of mirror. Fogs up like crazy!",1
2,"This didn't do anything really for my lashes. The formula left my lashes stiff and thin looking. I have decent lashes as it is, but rely on mascara and different application techniques to enhance them. This formula and brush were just not for me, I really wanted to like it due to all the rave reviews (seriously, I depend on those!) but it wasn't meant to be. I did give it two stars due to the fast shipping and cute packaging.",1
1,Very disappointed with this cologne. I will never buy from amazon again!,1
2,It isn't large enough to fit over even medium sized rollers.  If you only put 5 or 6 rollers on your head it might work fine,1
2,"I was expecting this nail polish to be really good but everytime I use it, it peels off within a couple days.",1
2,"I got this razor as a gift from my mom to replace my last electric shaver, which no longer held a charge.  The razor worked fine on my lower legs, where my hair is thicker and coarser (not great, but it did the job).  However, on my knees and upper legs, where the hair is softer and finer, it didn't do much of anything.  If I just wanted to wear capris, it did well enough, but for shorts I needed something else.  So I gave it back to my mom for her to use.    What I liked about it: the batteries.  It takes up so much less space not having the charging stand sitting on the counter, and when the batteries die, I can just pop in new ones (we have rechargables).  The battery on my old razor died after two years and was nearly impossible to replace.    I got the Clio Palm Perfect to replace this one, and after only a few uses, I love it.  It works so much better!",1
2.0,The product has (3) heads. When I started to use them (replaced them) one of the heads malfunctioned!!! Just Quit! As I needed to use the remaining (2)  and i have proceded with them. It would be nice if a replacement could be sent. I don't have the bad head as it somehow was thrown away.,1
1,It RUINED 2 of my favorite shirts before I realized it will bleach your clothes.  What happened was I was sweating and the sweat carried the product to my shirts and bleached them. I looked all over each tube and could't find any warning about bleaching.  I'm guessing it's the acne control lotion because the active ingredient sounds like it would bleach. Also my eye brows are almost white now.<br /><br />I thought I was saving money until it ruined my 2 favorite shirts which I will never be able to replace and those cost me over 50 dollars.  From now on I'll stick to lab series products.,1
1.0,stained sheets,1
1,Not a great brush for face painting,1
1,"Product came very fast. but when I opened the tube, it the mascara was thick and dry,  I'm not comfortable using it as it looks old to me.",1
2,"It'll curl your hair, yes, but that curl won't hold very long. I don't know why, considering this thing gets pretty hot. If you have short, fine hair, and all you want is a loose curl, then this is for you. But if you have long, thick, hair and you want thick, tight curls, invest in something better.",1
2,"I have purchased this cream from the Spain manufacturer before. It was the first thing that worked for my hyperpigmentation. Ran out, and purchased from this US supplier which the US formal manufacturer claims it's one of their distributors. It has done NOTHING for my pigmentation at all. What an expensive money waster.",1
2,Did not like! Dried out my skin and was overly greasy! Will not buy again in the future.,1
2,The container of this product is damaged so long term this product won't last.  For the price I am not pleased with the quality of packaging.,1
1.0,It broke when trying to place on device,1
2,I ordered this because of the raving reviews. Unfortunately it makes no difference for my hair at all. Would not order again.,1
1,"Too restrictive for my heater, when the temperature really dropped it ran continuously but did not keep the house warm enough. Took a while to figure out that the heater was OK, I just needed to go back to the normal filter. Lot of money for something I could not use.",1
1,"I used a pair before I went to bed. Kept waking up from an annoying dull pain, still in pain 12 hours later. There's no noticeable whitening in my teeth. Boooo!",1
1,This does not work as said.<br />No result!,1
1,"This color, unlike the red*<br />*(which will cover any hair known to mankind, and turns out fuchsia, BTW)<br />  doesn't lay down much color at all/<br />  and doesn't hold.",1
2,this cologne was not i was expecting.,1
1.0,Beware. I was looking specifically for the older version of Avon Skin So Soft (not their current formula which have received negative reviews). The picture shown is not the same as what I received. I got the version with the newest label (and Jojoba added to boot). Very disappointed as I ordered this priority shipping in time for a week long camping trip with lots of mosquitos expected.,1
2,Not enough hair to install on a full sew-in. Not 200 grams at all. Doesn't look like the picture. Save your money.,1
1,"As someone else mentioned, this is NOT the cologne from Victoria's Secret that I had enjoyed for hers. I don't like it at all.",1
2,"I knew it would be too red, so I mixed it with another color.  It is pretty if you want true red. I wish there was a true reddish brown-which means more brown than red, I believe. The name should be changed to match the color.  I hope to keep mixing it with my other dark brown because it has nice tones to it. Please keep it for redheads and add a true reddish brown.  I can assure you that it would be a big hit.",1
1,"I have been wanting to try this shampoo for a long time. On the informercials the models hair is full, shiney, just beautiful. Now I am not that gullible and I really did not expect to get the same results as on television, I did however expect for my hair to at least feel clean. I don't think that is asking too much!! Used the shampoo/condition for the past 3 days. My hair felt like there was a film on it. It look flat and lifeless. I read other bad reviews and should have paid attention instead of wasting my money.",1
1,Do not buy unless you like &#34;illuminated&#34; mirrors without illumination....Wish I considered reading the other reviews before I purchased it.,1
1,"not good at all. i had beautiful scandinavian blond, couldn't buy it this time and decided to use this one. it grey, solid grey...don't buy it",1
1,Doesn't work had to use dish soap 5 different washes to get out of my haor,1
2,Contrary to everything I read about how much the strips stick -- often too much -- these barely<br />stayed on. Felt like there was little or no result. But appreciate that Crest gives a full refund!,1
1,BAD PRODUCT. Faulty tube dispenser! One tube was gone in one use and other tube broke. Cheap product. Same name brand as sold at my dentist office but NOT THE SAME QUALITY. Beware,1
1,"I was thinking that this product would beep after 30 seconds at each quadrant and it doesn't, the manual says it does this only on 'select ' models.<br /><br />It says that it drives fluid between teeth, it doesn't.<br /><br />The brush is way too noisy as well.",1
2,These are tiny. About half the size of the Beauty Blenders. They don't do much good because they are so small.,1
2,"The product is excellent however the packaging was totally inadequate.  The outer crystal bottle was completely shattered.  When one pays that much for a product you would expect it to arrive in one piece, not several.",1
1,I have never gotten the product ! I really needed these and never have shown up I bought other stuff over seas and it showed up 3 weeks ago but these nver have made it ! Not happy about it and want my money back!,1
2,Not what I expected! It breaks the hair to often!,1
1,"I bought the hand pack thinking this would help, as I have to wash my hands A Lot.  It made my cuticles  and hang nails worse; even wearing the gloves at night.  I will not use their products again as my lips are burning after using the lip balm.  I'll stick with good old Vaseline and baby oil.  Much cheaper and works much better.  Their hype about beeswax sounds good but doesn't work; stick to naturals instead of paying big bucks.  Would love to hear a company response.",1
2,"I've been going through a shampoo identity crisis.  I have extremely sensitive skin, and after using Head and Shoulders for years, it seemed to be irritating the skin around my hairline and contributing to breakouts.  I've been shampoo experimenting for the last couple of months.<br />This shampoo doesn't lather much, which would be okay if I felt like it was still doing its job.  However, I can't really tell I've used it.  In a way, I guess that is appealing, because it is very light and doesn't leave any residue.  I guess I just expect to be able to tell when I've just shampooed my hair.<br />Also, my husband said he thinks it is causing him to have breakouts, which he doesn't usually get as often.  We will probably use up the bottle, but won't be buying again.  Time to look for the next experiment!",1
1,when i got these i was excited...untill i tried them....out of all of the nails i got only 3 sizes fit me.  waste of money.,1
2,I was excited to use this device but cannot use it because it's too hot for my skin.  I tested it out first on my arm and it was burning hot! My mother tested it out on her arm but felt fine.  Luckily it came with a 30 day money back guaranteed. If your skin is sensitive to heat don't have high hopes for Zeno.,1
2.0,I have used this light several times it takes forever to dry. regular polish drys faster.  With that said not sure if its the light or polish but it takes at least double what it should. Very disappointed. It wont last even a week.,1
1,"Was not happy at all the self tanning lotion came out green , stained my hands green , glad I did not try to apply on my body. Either it was an old item , what awaate of money!!!!",1
2,This unit has not been reliable for me or a friend who owns the exact same unit.  Take the reading 3 times in a row and you will often get a vastly different result each time. I'm sending mine back to the manufacturer.,1
1,I had a Reach toothbrush that had a rounder handle. This handle was flat and not as comfortable.,1
1,This was filled up with something else - would not buy this ever again,1
1,I use dry shampoos fairly regularly since I have fine hair that gets greasy. Washing my hair everyday makes it a lot drier than it needs to be (since I also color my hair) so if I don't wash it or dry shampoo it every day it looks pretty slick and flat. I found this dry shampoo to be too potent in its citrusy sweet smell and many times my hair would come out looking sort of whitish-gray. I won't be purchasing this again.,1
1,I got this product and package look very old then I called to check at Olay customer service to asked them the lot number on the package for check the expiration date so it expired on 2010. Should be careful.,1
1,"This is the third Andis Hangup Hairdryer I have bought and the problem is the same in each one, the switch!  I just bought this last  one less than a month ago and the on/off switch is already giving me trouble. This will definitely be the last one regardless of its convenience.",1
2.0,"This did absolutely zero for my hair.  It didn't hold my hair at all and didn't control frizz.  What a waste of cash!  My stylist recommended No-Poo, Set It Free and Arc Angel and I, foolishly, purchased all three products because he assured me that for best results I should use all three in conjunction with one another.  Hogwash!  Now I'm out $60 and have almost full bottles stashed in my hall closet that I have no intention of using again.  What a waste.  I don't know what all the hype about this hair care line is about.  Perhaps those with curlier hair benefit in some way, but there are less expensive products that work much better.  Got2be Shine Serum controls frizz even in high humidity and their Kinkier mousse is strong but not crunchy and the hold lasts all day.  I have no idea what I'll do with what's left of the Deva products.  Perhaps someone with curly hair will come into my life and I can offload them on someone else.  I surely won't use them ever again.  The No-Poo is no better than VO5 Kiwi Lime conditioner (I secret I discovered from a beauty review website) and is ten times less expensive.  Again, what a waste.  Spend your money on a nice bottle of perfume or some such luxury.  Skip this line, there's nothing worthy of the expense.  I definitely don't recommend this product.",1
2,"It is very quiet which is nice, but it doesn't seem to have the same power or speed my old Remington did. For daily work-week shaving my shadow starts to come back 2-2:30 so it doesn't cut very close. On the flipside, if I skip shaving Sat/Sun, when I shave for Monday morning it does very well. Not worth the price.",1
1,"I tried this on several different occasions and my eyes looked worse afterwards each time.  I am not sure why, because it seems it should work very well.",1
1,this item was terrible. did not do anything it stated it would. don't waste your money. buy something else that will actually work.,1
2,"There is nothing about the Derm products that I cared anything about.  The serum was very runny and I like a serum, such as Olay Regenerist that stays on your face and leaves a nice clean feeling.  I am familiar with the doctor who supposedly created the merchandise and him being a plastic surgeon, I was even more disappointing.  As a hint to the makers, the white and red design on each product is blah and not appealing as well.  Not recommend.",1
2,I've been wearing Beautiful Sheer for 4 years. I just started using the most recent bottle and noticed it did not smell the same. There was a pronounced musk scent. I will be switching to another fragrance.,1
1,the Sox suck they are nothing like I thought they would be really want my money back. I waited a long time and it was not what I expected do not buy this product,1
1,"I was not happy at all.  I ordered Style Sexy Hair (shown in black and red here) BUT got short hair mousse (yellow and silver) instead.  Apparently something was wrong with it as it never did foam up into a mousse, but rather stayed a blue blob in the palm of my hand.<br />Again, I did not get what I ordered and the product that was sent to me must have been old or defective.<br /><br />NOT HAPPY AT ALL!",1
1,HOLA ESTE PRODUCTO NUNCA ME LO MANDARON EL COBRARON Y ME HE CANSADO DE PASAR MENSAJE Y NO ME RESPONDE LA COMPAÑIA ME GUSTARIA QUE ME LO MANDEN GRACIAS,1
1,"I've used Prince Matchabelli's lotions and perfumes for years but the dusting powder I just received doesn't smell anything like it. Hardly has any scent! Very disapointed. I purchased two, one for me and the other one for a gift. Hope she likes the pretty box.",1
1,"Bellavani is not a great product.  In addition, their whole &#34;ploy&#34; of offering you a $4.95 &#34;TRIAL&#34; offer is bogus.  They follow up with a $98 charge on your account and that is to cover the &#34;TRIAL&#34; version.  This is not a product that is worth $100 --",1
1,"I  ordered this as a Mother's Day gift. The fragrance is one that my wife adored some years ago, so when I saw it on Amazon I was glad to place the order. This item NEVER arrived. A week AFTER MOTHER'S DAY I Contacted the company FRAGRANCE ZONE and advised them that THE order didn't arrive in time for my gifting purpose so they could cancel the order. A few days later I receive a notice that the charge for the item had been deducted from my account. I then look online to CHECK THE STATUS since they billed me anyway. The item is listed as DELIVERED. I check the house perimeter, my neighbors, the postal delivery carrier and the Post Office. The item never ARRIVED. I follow up with the shipper FRAGRANCE ZONE and was advised a refund was being issued. Three weeks later NO REFUND. HAD TO ENVOLVE AMAZON directly. I also noticed the perfume was never offered to be RESHIPPED. This caused me to wonder if The Fragrance Zone ever had the item to ship. Be FOR WARNED.",1
1,I usually use the regular Fair & Lovely and I've always loved it. It was the first time seeing The ayurdic one so I decided to try it. Big mistake!! After about a week of using it my face broke out in rash- like acne. I stopper using it then and it took over a month for the acne to go away. I had to throw a away the rest of the tube. Definitely not buying this again. I will just stick to the regular one,1
1,This product just stopped working after 5 months.  I would not recommend buying this product.  It wasnt cheap and I expected it to last longer than 5 months,1
1,Did not receive the color polish as seen in the picture,1
2,This stuff feels like you are putting paste on your face. Makes your face look very greasy. And the packaging is really cheap. The tub wants to ben in half and it feels like you'll break the top off when you try to open/close it.,1
1,"No shampoo can do what this claims it can do, maybe prevention....<br />I am looking for more of a promoter of hair not prevention...",1
1,Never worked right!,1
2,"I don´t like it at all! it hurts so bad I can´t even explain it, it´s just not what i was expecting",1
1,"So let me just start by saying this is not the review I had planned on leaving. I've ordered two sets of these extentions, about 6 months apart. The first set I ordered I absolutely loved. They stayed thick and luscious feeling even still today. The only reason I ordered the second set was because I cut the first ones and wanted longer hair again. The second set I got was just completly different from the first. They had a weird plastic type feel to them. I figured it was just the packaging had rubbed off on them over time. Nothing a quick little rinse can fix right? No. They tangled immediately after I rinsed them. (I did not use shampoo as it is drying to extensions.) I left them alone to dry before I combed them out. Using a brush specifically designed for extensions I tried to brush them. They shed so much hair. I figured ok ill straighten them as I always have extensions. I use professional products and a chi flat iron. By the time I got them straightened, which took some work as they just wouldn't lay straight, there was a pile of hair on the floor you could barely see through. I have resorted to using them when I wear my hair in a bun, meaning I don't use any styling tools on them. They are now entangling into my own hair. I bought these two months ago and they are more dry than the cheap $20 sets I used to order just for fun. I will not be buying these again nor will I recommend them to anyone else.",1
2,"I got this product for my daughter who is one of those Proactive gotta have types. I figured this product being organic would be good for her. WRONG. according to her, her skin felt greasy when she got to the last step. She claimed the smell was good, but she didn't get a clean tingly feeling once she finished, so according to her, the system was a zilch. that is it. not recommended by me at all.",1
1,This like every other cheap mousse sold at drugstores -- except 5x the price! Hair is sticky (even with a very small amount applied) and always looks super dry. My blonde hair looks like curly hay. Awful.,1
1,I received the lip gloss and not the lipstick! Unfortunately I am unable to return it since my niece opened it and tried it on! I really wanted the lipstick and that is what it told me i was going to get.,1
1.0,Was excited for my package. Then found a bottle with a broken pump inside. Mad me sad!,1
1,I used this just once and my eyelids are bright red and tender!  I am very disappointed and unhappy that I wasted my money.,1
2,"As a long time Sonicare user, I can tell you this: Forget this one and buy the Sonicare instead. Your teeth and gums will thank you for the wise choice. About the only interesting thing about this powered toothbrush have is its rotating brushes. But rotating brush head is also its major weakness: It is so underpowered that if you press it a little hard (very little) to your teeth and the thing stops. The tooth brush does not have enough power to keep rotating!<br /><br />With Sonicare, you have quarter-pause and 2-minute timer. Every 30 seconds Sonicare tells you to switch side and your brushing session always last 2 minutes. And the cleanliness you feel after brushing is priceless. The Conair has none of that, or I did not have a complete brushing session to know. I charged the toothbrush full (almost 24 hours and the light turned off to tell me it is full charged) and tried. It only took 15 seconds for me to know that this doesn't work for me and probably never will. I kept having to move the toothbrush aways from my teeth for it to contiue working. This in additional to expensive and tough to find brush head (as I heard) make the Conair not a good buy.<br /><br />3/12/15 UPDATE: I tried it again today to make sure I did not miss any thing. I left it plugged in for longer 24 hrs to ensure the battery is fully charged. Then squeezed a pea size toothpaste on it. Same result! The toothbrush stopped with just a little bit of pressure. It now definitely will be retired to the garage waiting for a trip to Goodwill.",1
1.0,Did not work like the picture and description.  Disappointed.,1
1,I like the shampoo and hair treatment oil but the reason i gives one star is becoz they send me 1oz bottle. I ordered 2oz bottle.,1
1.0,"Bad product. It's work just for a month,like 5 or 6 time and gets damage w/o any reason.",1
2,They only thing good about mo butta is that the cream smell good other then that they dont stand behind the product at all I been using it for a month no on result at all the best enhancements cream is glute boost,1
2,"I consider myself normal/dry skin.. it makes my skin even drier. If you have normal or oil skin, this Aloe mask will probably be good for you.",1
1.0,These clips do not work very well. I am a professional stylist and hoped hoped that these clips would be similar to other brands I have used. I hate them. They simply will not slide through the hair. The bottom of the clip has a faulty shape and makes them impossible to use for parting the hair or sectioning. They are actually painful to use as they pull the hair. The T3 brand is more expensive but worth it.,1
1,I put this product on my legs before retiring one night.  It produced a slightly burning/tingling sensation and such horrible smell that I could not sleep and ended up washing it off.  The smell is reminiscent of my gym locker room in high school.,1
1,My bottle arrived with a loose cap so all of the product had leaked into the rapper.....ugh! Wont order from this distributor again!,1
2,Way to expensive.  Was expecting a high quality facial product for the price.  Better off buy Loreal skin care products.  They absorb quickly and you see a difference with your skin after 6 weeks.,1
2,Poor Construction and quality.,1
2.0,"This is a nice mirror, but it's very, very heavy, which doesn't make it ideal for travel.",1
2.0,This just doesn't smell like Terre D'Hermes for Men.  Smells completely different that the regular bottle and not that great either.  Bought this for husband to travel with.  He won't use it.,1
2,"Has no affect on anyone! test on my wife Nothing, Tested on my Colledge babe next door neighbors Nothing even tested out at a club nothing. You can sell it as Nothing in a bottle.",1
1.0,Too shiny . The curls were very lovely though but its better for if youre going to wear a costume .,1
2,if you have rellly thick calluses this file is not for you. i had purchased a foot file at my local cvs. unfortunately my husband stepped on it rendering it unusable. i couldnt find another in the small town i live in so i hopped on amazon. this has done virtually nothing for my rough feet except tear up my thick calluses actually making them worse. 2 stars only bc it has a nice deslgn. i do like how the handle is curved making it easier to grip than most. and its a nice color apart from the boring white,1
2,"The first time I received this product it failed after only 3 months. I contacted Toilettree at the email address on their web site. I had a reply within an hour, and a replacement unit was in my hands within 48 hours! What wonderful customer service! I'm not used to such great service from consumer product companies. Toilettree has outstanding customer service. But sadly this product is not one that they should continue to offer.<br /><br />It has been just over 4 months since I received my replacement unit, and now it too has failed. This one not only failed, it managed to damage my bathroom in the process. While I was briefly away from the housoe at the market the unit decided to turn itself on. It emptied its tank onto a \\""popcorn finish\\"" drywall ceiling, washing away the popcorn and soaking the drywall.<br /><br />I heard the product still running when I arrived home from the store but of course I was too late. The tank was empty, the battery was running down, wet popcorn compound was all over the bathroom floor, fixtures, towels, etc. The ceiling looks awful and will need to be professionally repaired.<br /><br />There is no chance that I somehow left this thing turned on -- that's impossible because water really shoots out of it with force. Nonetheless I recharged it just to see if it was possessed by demons and sure enough it is. It has decided to randomly switch itself on for no apparent reason.<br /><br />A poorly made, unreliable product.",1
2,"I really like the Shea butter that olay makes. This is nothing at all like the thick, creamy consistency that this brand is known for. It is very runny, and I hardly smelled the coconut. I'm mad I purchased more than one bottle.",1
1,Product did not work after several weeks of use. Smell is awful and unbearable at times. Since my tag was on my neck the smell was very strong and caused headaches. I have not used the product in several months and my skin is itchy and painful to the touch where I was applying it on top of the skin tag still being there. So basically all it did was give me headaches and irritate he skin on my neck where my tag remains.,1
1,I got this in few weeks ago. I love it. That is very nice.  Have nice a day.  Good job,1
1,I bought this item with Oster Fast Feed clippers. The item would be great if it fit them. Universal Comb Set it is not.,1
1,"I recently bought these. Once I received them (before opening) I was excited. Oh before I continue these took such a long time to be shipped to my house. Anyways once I opened the package I was furious! Glitter was everywhere! I didn't receive a box like most of the people on here I received A PLASTIC BAG! Once I opened and took 1 pot out it was only a quarter filled! Also some of the pots were either cracked, scratched, or only half/quarter of the way filled. taking out the other 44 pots my hands were covered with glitter. Honestly I will never buy this again it's a waste.",1
1.0,I was extremely disappointed in this product and not so much just for the fact that it didn't work but also made my short thinning lashes worse. This product cause them to break and fall out. My lashes are now noticeably shorter and thinner than prior to use.,1
2,"They all fell apart, some even before using them.. Very disappointed. A few work which is good i guess. Overall wouldn't recommend these.",1
1,"I found this toe nail nipper impossible to use.  I couldn't fit it under the toe nail to find a way to clip the nail.  I even tried it upside down--no better, of course.  Also there was a rough edge on the \\""nipper\\"" that needs to be filed smooth.",1
1,"Didn't realize this stuff is like rope, won't fit with 1/2 my teeth.",1
2,"The fragrance on this product is way too heavy. If it's to mask the sunscreen smell, I'd rather smell the sunscreen. I'll give this product the 2 stars for the SPF protection and the light coverage on my fair skin, but holy smokes! Not something I will buy again, unless the fragrance is removed. I wish it would have been noted somewhere on the product aside from the tail end of the list of inactive ingredients.",1
1,It is fabulous!  Have used this product for 40 years as did my mother and daughter uses it now also .,1
1,"Sure, his nails would avoid being bitten, but I don't think it is worth it if it makes your kid throw up. I will be returning it and definitely not suggesting to anyone else despite the many good reviews. Poor little guy! :(",1
2.0,fell apart after 2nd use - was able to repair  but will not buy another one,1
1,It's been 2 weeks that I have been using this product on my hair and my hair hasn't grown at all its really disappointing however it has became thicker but not longer,1
2,"this is not the 1st of this brand for me, but i'm afraid it may be the last...?  i think it is me more than the brand.  my hands shake slightly, which make a fatter liner, like these, too hard to use.  maybe i will try this brand in a different venue?!?",1
1,"Why many people liked it? I guess it is Magic in that sense. Ugly package, bad smell and waxy uneasy feeling on skin.",1
2,"I got a brush with the same brand but from a different seller before  and i decided to get another one since the first brush i got was really nice. However, with the same brand, same color but different seller this time, I did not have the same positive experience as i did before. It did not really get rid of the tangles and my hair fell off quite a lot whenever i brush it with this brush. Feel very regretful that i did not return it right away!",1
1,"It breaks my heart to have to give a Maybelline product any less than 5 stars but this product is a total miss.  I have used many different brands of eyebrow pencils in my day and Maybelline's New York Define-a-Brow pencil takes the cake for being the worse.  This pencil has 0 color payoff and I find myself having to tug on my eyebrow for any color to show up at all.  The tiny comb on the one end is a nice feature for grooming my brows but the pencil itself is terrible, I do not have thick eyebrows at all and this pencil does nothing to shade in bald spots and does not blend even a little bit. If you are considering buying this product do not bother.Do yourself a favor and just use a matte brow powder instead.",1
2,"I have purchased two of these and after about 6 months of sparse use they both broke. The first one just stopped working, the second one started to sound like it was going to blow up. Works great until it dies, but not worth it for such a short lasting product",1
1.0,Very small and zipper broke within 2 days and that was with just 3 it's in it. Didn't like it.,1
1.0,"omg these suck so horribly!! every time I go to pull it off a ton of remnant strip is left on my skin! It takes FOREVER to get it off.

1,"I've had three other Versace colognes, but this is the worse.  It smells GREAT once sprayed, but the fragrance is gone minutes later.  Seriously.  I couldn't smell the cologne on me less than 10 minutes later so I sprayed even more.  Minutes later, nothing.  Not sure if this is a bad batch or something (evidently this has been the case with other buyers), but don't waste your money on this particular cologne.",1
1,Total and complete crap......,1
1,"I guess when you don't pay much you don't get much. These fell apart on the first use. Three of the brushes came off of the handle. The brush heads were cheaply made with cheap materials. Wish these would have lasted, would have been a great starter set.",1
1,No good,1
1,"This product did not work as good as the Aveeno skin brighter, which was less money.",1
2,"I used to absolutely LOVE the Deep Sea Cosmetics moisturizer. It was the only one I would use.   It was very light and gentle and left the skin radiant.  Now they have changed the formula to add sunblock to it, and it is completely different. It doesn't feel as light and gentle as before, it basically feels just as if I am applying sunscreen rather than a moisturizer.",1
1.0,Smells terrible,1
2,"So it says it has 2 heat/speed settings.  Yeah, sure, it has 2 speed settings, but only ONE heat setting, which is hotter than Hades and burns my hand.  Plus when I turn it on initially it smells like burning flesh already.  It's like it just melts your skin.<br /><br />I guess this is okay for some people, but I prefer to dry my hair on low heat so as not to fry it to oblivion.",1
1,"I bought a good glass nail file years ago from a Hallmark store for $5 or $6. I keep it in my car and it works great.  I wanted a few more for around the house and decided to give these a try.  They are not very good quality as the file portion doesn't work very well and seems like it is wearing down whereas, I don't think I'll ever have to replace my original one.  I wouldn't buy these again or recommend them.",1
1,"I've been a Maybelline mascara user for YEARS - who doesn't have one of those little pink tubes of Great Lash around?  Even my mother always had one, and I don't remember her using mascara.  I felt sure that I would like their other products as well, and after comparing a couple of options at the store I grabbed this one.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the overwhelming smell.  It doesn't seem that something intended to go that close to your eye should have such a strong odor, and it bothered me. Whether you think it smells good or bad, it's just too strong.<br /><br />The brush, while it looked great conceptually, was way too big for me.  I have small eyes with very long, but very pale and thin/sparse lashes, and even with what I consider a pretty steady hand it was hard to just hit the lashes without smudging makeup on my skin.<br /><br />Once I got it where I wanted it, it didn't STAY there.  It was a lot clumpier than I expected, and that kind of made sense to me.  Since the intent is to volumize (I read that as \\""make wider/fuller\\"" vs. \\""make longer\\""), if your lashes are thin or sparse wouldn't it have to clump to fill in the gaps?  Just a thought - I don't really know how it's supposed to work.<br /><br />Because I DO have long lashes, I've experienced some smudging with other brands if I blink too soon after putting it on, but never as much as this.  It also flakes off quickly, and flakes off if touched at all.  Every other mascara I've tried can tolerate a little \\""poking\\"" with the end of my finger to push clumped lashes apart, etc, but this just flakes off and leaves bare spots.  It's odd.<br /><br />Finally, and probably the most important reason why I won't use it again, it made the skin around my eyes itchy.  Even if it looked great, I wouldn't keep using it.<br /><br />Looks like I'll be going back to my old standby!",1
1,"This is an exorbitant price to pay for 4 tubes of this hand cream. You can purchase the cream for $18.00 elsewhere, so that 4 tubes would be half the price, $72.00. I am not sure how this cream came to be sold here.<br /><br />The Handmade is an excellent cream for hands,  for anyone who prefers an ultra-rich, emollient hand cream; and anyone who wants to moisturize hands while enjoying a delectable lemon custard scent.<br /><br />Not Recommended At This Price. prisrob 01-05-14",1
2,"It's better to buy it in fragrance shop where you can test it, I know that it lasts for 5 days, because I tried it in the shop in Ukraine and the price was 100$ for 1.6 ounce, thats why i decided to buy it from Amazon twice cheaper but this lasts only few hours. I dont know why, maybe testers in the shop are more concentrate.",1
2,I bought his thinking it might resemble the original &#34;Baryshnikov&#34; I used 20 years ago.  It's not even close. It has a strong air freshener kind of smell and that is why I keep it in the bathroom for spraying the air. It was only 8 bucks. WHY DON'T THEY  sell the old Baryshnikov again?  It was very popular back then when I used it.,1
1,"doesnt smell good, hands dry out fast",1
1.0,Do not waste your money on this product. It is NOT the original Jean Nate. It smells like a combination of after shave and the inside of a plastic tub. I will pour it down the sink. I'm so disappointed.,1
1,"I like this product very much when it is operational.  However, each of the two that I purchased stopped working after one year of occasional use.  The motor simply dies.  I am very hesitant to buy another Waterpik product.",1

1,I hate it. Its peels off right after you put it on. Its a total waste of money. I do not recommend this product,1
1,"I brought this eye cream at local BJ's yesterday.<br />Last night when I opened it, the cream is not cream, it is a wax like yellowish thing.<br />It is very hard to spread on the skin, especially the skin right under the eye.<br />I called Hydrolyze customer service tonight. She first confirmed it should be a cream, then after she heard my concerns (should this product be a cream or a wax), she said, \\""oh, this product should be a wax like cream. This is a new product line\\""<br />Hello, \\""wax like cream\\""? Who ever heard such word for eye cream?<br />The she asked me what I want to do - \\""do you want to return the product or continue use it?\\""<br />With the customer service like this, I will ever use this eye cream any more.<br /><br />Oh, plus I do NOT believe a \\""wax like eye cream\\""!<br /><br />-p.s. it irritated the skin under my eye.

1,"Could not believe how uncomfortable these slippers were! Ordered a large which the description said would fit a ladies size 8-10 (I typically wear a size 9 shoe) and they were waaaaaay too small and so tight! I requested the start of a return as I was going to send them back and Amazon refunded me and said I did not need to return the item! :) great customer service Amazon, just wished they would've worked out. Ended up going back to my old standby: Isotoners ballerina type slippers. Can't beat 'em!",1
2,I bought this to trim and taper my wigs. It could be there's a learning curve but I've made three serious attempts to use it and it hasn't gotten any easier. It pulls and snags the hair and it's money and hope that I've thrown away.,1

1,"At first, I liked this dryer a lot. After only 3 months of owning it, taking good care of it, and using it maybe 2-3 days a week, the heat died so now it only blows cold air on every setting. Just before the heating element crapped out, I could hear the power surging, so I'm guessing something shorted out. It didn't have any sort of burning smell, it just quit doing it's job. I wouldn't recommend this product, it's unreliable. Spend a bit more money and get a dryer that will have staying power.",1
2,"I only gave it an extra star because it's organic. I bought this at Ulta the other day and was disappointed. It was drier than the Sahara, hard to apply to my lips, and tasted terrible. Maybe I got a bad tube, but it's not worth spending another 5 bucks on. I'll be looking elsewhere.",1
1.0,Peeled on the first day of application. Tried twice.  Was not satisfied. But bought 2 other colors that did not peel and lasted well over 2 weeks but were not true to color description.  Found youtube videos that review colors and will use them for future purchases.,1
2,"Although I have gotten many compliments on how cute the apron is, and it is as advertised bleach and color resistant,  it is by no means built to last. I have worn it for about two weeks, never laundered it and already the threading is falling apart. (The belt has come apart and falling off.) I would not suggest this apron for any working stylist as it will fall apart very quickly.  Very, very cute but not worth the money.",1
1,"I received this Avon Skin So Soft as a gift so I thought I'd give it a try.   After closely following the directions, I tried a small patch on my lower legs.    Beside the obvious pain (which really wasn't bad), the wax does not come all the way off when you pull up on the cloth strips.   It left bits of dried wax all over the small \\""test patch\\"" area on my leg which I used the entire bottle Soothing oil (provided in the kit) to remove most of the wax.    They need to provide a gallon of this oil to remove the wax if you're going to wax your entire legs.    Do not bother with this kit.    Spend the extra money and go to a salon to have a professional do it!",1

1,"Fell apart as I took it out if the box, cheaply made and not even glued together; not worth the return postage.",1
1.0,Warning! Apparently this mask does not fit well with many facial structures. Huge bleed through of light around the nose area. I assume having a high arching nose will work well with this mask to cover light penetration. Be confident in your purchase because no refunds/returns offered by seller.,1
2,"The trimmer does not work - at all. It doesn't cut the hair or do anything to it, actually.<br />Pros : light and compact<br />Cons : trimmer too small and doesn't but anyway. Head not that flexible at all.",1

I shampoo on the left side of the bowl, as most do. (I am right handed) The release lever is positioned on the right side of the chair:/ There is a lot of resistance when laying the client back. I would like for the chair to be heavier. When I have my 200# plus clients reclined back, I am affraid the chair will tip back. I would not have bought this on a show floor.",1
1,"Beware - product packaging is deceiving.  I love this stuff, but thought the powder was hardened since I couldn't get anymore to come out after using it very little.  Upon breaking the tube open, I realized that there is hardly ANY in the bottle!  The tube is not entirely filled (minus the space for the brush in the bottom).",1
1,second one that goes bad within 3 month. I used to trust panasonic products but now no more,1
1,it comes out almost clear. not what i expected,1
2,"Edited to say that I wasn't following the instructions to put it on, which involve a second product and are fairly complex.  So maybe my experience would improve with the second product, but.....  On their own ingredients list, it says US products may include Red 40, Blue 1, and Yellow 5.  In the first place, so much for natural.  In the second place, I don't like companies that have different formulations in Europe and the U.S. - I interpret that to mean they know that Europe won't let them put in the gunk that the U.S. will, and they are taking advantage of it.  I'm off to keep looking for a truly natural lip color, or go back to one with gunk that at least isn't as expensive.  ************************  You get practically no time before it dries.  What I try to do is put a fast, but (hopefully) accurate, line at the bottom of my lower lip and then blot my lips together, fast, to distribute it, being careful to smear it around well and not go past the top of my upper lip.  If you make a mistake and get it past your lip line, it is *not* going to come off anytime soon.  And it's real easy to get uneven coverage.  You gotta really concentrate during the process.  It's also a little darker and redder than I had hoped - with a name like &#34;Earth Red,&#34; I was hoping for a bit more subdued color.  Nevertheless, I like that it's not full of yucky ingredients like regular brands.  And it does color your lips absolutely all day, although the color fades.  (By about halfway through the day, it's closer to the color I hoped it would be when applied.)",1
1,"I purchased item this for my wife, and my wife discovered after opening it that it was likely a knockoff.  It was in a similar bottle, but it was not exactly the same and the smell of the perfume was nothing like authentic Acqua di Gio.  Although my wife loves Acqua di Gio perfume, I would never order this product again from Amazon.com.",1
2,"I heard this was great stuff but it just didn't work out for me, so I returned it.  Maybe it works for others and is a good product but I found it difficult to work with, even following the standard way to apply concealer the professional way, i.e., using light fingertip taps and a professional brush.",1
1.0,Did not work the way they were advertised.,1
2,Not what I expected.,1
1,"OMG!!! I ordered this shampoo twice by mistake, but I thought I wouldn't have an issue since I LOVE their leave-in. But let me tell you this is the worst product I have ever used: 1.I lost so much hair while using it and I couldn't figure that this was it. 2.I agree it leaves your hair very smooth but what is the point since it doesn't even feel like you wash it? 3. It is big because you need put 4x of what you normally use of shampoo since you won't use condition.",1
2,"it very much.  This, however, doesn't seem to work as well.  The can at work may be older and perhaps the formula has changed, but I will not purchase this product again.",1
1,Started falling apart and looking dirty after the first week however Amazon was great and reimbursed me,1
2,I hesitated for a pretty long time before purchasing this but it left my skin very flaky looking. There were chalky residues that makes the face look unnatural. I like the sponge it came with though and that's about it. So 2 stars because of the sponge.,1
1,"I ordered the Mizani ThermaSmooth shampoo and ThermaSmooth conditioner from Costsell.com.  I immediately knew something was wrong when the shampoo poured out of the bottle like water.  It actually looked like milk and it didn't clean my hair.

Costsell.com responded to my email claiming that they check every product they send.  Sure!  They haven't offered to refund my money or accept the return of the product.  Before you order be sure that any Mizani product you buy is from an authorized Mizani dealer.  You can do this by calling the Mizani Company at 1 877 726 3624.  If you don't, you could get burned like I did.",1
2,"While it seems to cleanse Ok, I have not seen any reduction of oil in the t-zone, or smoothness of my skin whatsoever. That's what I bought this product for. My skin does feel clean after use, the menthol type fresh feeling is nice after a long day. However, no change in appearance at all. In fact, used it last night before bed, also applied the dermatological over night treatment, woke up to a fresh breakout. I am only giving it two stars because I haven't seen any of the results it promises in all the great reviews.<br /><br />If it had been a drugstore product I'd throw it away, but its too expensive to just throw out. I will use it but wont buy again. No results you couldn't get with a cheap can of Noxzema.",1
2,I wish I'd read your reviews before purchasing my pencil...I had my rep come by yesterday and take the pencil to see how it is to be sharpened...I also had 3 other colors picked out to order because I do like the look and wear of the pencil but to use it 1 week and then no way of sharpening is ridiculous...I would think Avon would have checked this out more before marketing it....,1
1,It felt horrible on my face like my skin couldn't breathe. I was so looking forward to having an organic product. What a disappointment!,1
1,love nexuss but hated this shampoo will never use it again or buy it again makes ur hair feel grimey,1
1,I am always looking for a shampoo that will work with my fine hair.  This was recommended to me.  I did not see any real difference after using it for about a month.  I ended up throwing what was left away and going back to my Wella Shampoo.  It still works better than anything else I have tried.,1
1,This did the exact opposite of what it was supposed to and didn't even mix well with the developer it says to use. It was chunky. Don't buy!,1
1.0,crappy product,1
2,"These do not add up to other products of the same type and Iv'e tried many, bargains and high end$$$. Best so far for the money is cosmetic skin solutions.

1,i bought this ring because its a black heart and adjustable size i have very small finger but the hard is ridiculous huge!!<br />worse purchase i made!!!,1

1,This leaves an orange residue on my skin.  It does not absorb well.,1
2,"Ah how sad when I begged my mom for a hair straightner and she cheaped out on me and bought me this 10 years ago. The straightner does not work at all, I have no idea what the velvet pads are for? And I didn't care much for the large waver. However I fell in love with the crimper and for a long time that was my look. My hair being so thick it took FOREVER to do just the top layer (never do your whole head) and at least it didn't do any damage, although I'm pretty sure it damaged anyone else's hair that tried it. I'm looking for a good mini crimper to replace this one, something that can do the job fast, have the same cute look and you don't have to SQUEEZE so very hard to get results.",1
1.0,"Very disappointed with this. Have to go over the same spot many times. Can't reach mustache hair under nose because the guard is so far in front of the actual blades. Vacuum barely works.

2,"I purchase the kitchen system at the store, then need refills and cannot find them. Go to Amazon find refills that say kitchen system receive them and then they do not fit. This is very frustrating. If feel companys are always taking advantage of their customers.",1
1.0,they melted in the microwave. do not let them overlap!,1
1,"This shampoo is expensive, no question about it.  It also did nothing for me.  In fact, for me, it was significantly worse than OTC \\""dry scalp\\"" shampoos.  It is the consistancy of water so it can more easily coat and inteact with you scalp, which is fine, but it means that you need to use more, thus making the product even more expensive than it seems.  While I agree that it leaves no buildup, it left my hair very dry and straw-like, left my scalp VERY dry (we're talking flaking within 2-3 hours of showering), and it also smells pretty bad - definitely a negative when its still noticable to my wife several hours later.  I did wait until I finished the bottle to be fair, and that took about 3.5 weeks of regular hair washings.  It started bad and ended bad.  To me this all adds up to a whopping 1 star review.  I won't be buying it again ever.",1
1,"This product was NOT Philiosophy!! I know Philosophy lotion, it did not smell right, it as liquidy, it was NOT sealed. Do not order form this site if you want Philosophy!!! and i cant get the seller to let me return the item!! very upset about this!!!",1
2.0,Reminds me of strong aftershave/cologne from the 1980s. Not a very modern scent and very synthetic.,1

2,"I have dark under eye circles hereditary they are kind of purplish. I have been using this cream for 4 weeks and the only thing i have noticed is the skin under my eyes is firmer but the circles have not gotten any better, not even a little bit.",1
2,"**Original 12/2010**<br />This may be a tough rating (1-star), but I think that the quality of this product can be found in the dollar store.  If it were $5 or under, I'd improve it's rating.  (And if it were $1, I'd give it 5-stars.)  As others have said, the threading is not high quality and the plastic is thin.  It's definitely not worth $10.  I was sent the all-clear variety instead of the colors, which I would have preferred.  It would have been nice to be able to specify your preference!<br /><br />There are pros to this product, though, and I'm not going to return it.  It is definitely useful and convenient.  It fits 8 vitamins (including big ones like my fish oil and calcium), and has room for more!  You can probably fit two of those soft chewables in addition to fish oil, calcium, multi, and others.  I probably could have gone a size smaller, but this will be great when I'm traveling and can double up on my days.<br /><br />**UPDATE 10/2012**<br />I just improved my rating a little to 2-stars (If I could do 2.5, I would).  I still don't think this product is worth more than $5.<br /><br />However, I've been using it for a couple years now, and it has held up.  I've dropped it on a ceramic tile floor, and while the container popped open and all of my vitamins spilled over the floor and under the fridge (ugh!), there were only cracks on the containers and chips off of the screw-top threading.  The container now looks like it has a stained glass look since there are cracks ALL over it.  So why would I improve the rating after this?  Well, the containers still screw together and they didn't actually shatter.  I suspect they will break, though, after another tumble or two, but I was pleasantly surprised!  I should also add that the containers have become disconnected on other occasions... in my suitcase.  Luckily at those times, they were contained.  But it's still a less than ideal happening.  The threads aren't high quality.  You need to be extra careful thatyou have all of the threads alined and twist the container tightly -- but not too tightly (or it will crack).  I think it might be an art.<br /><br />One additional piece of advice... the containers are NOT WATERPROOF.  I took it camping and threw it in the cooler on the drive up (thinking back, I don't know why did that!) and let's just say that it was rather disgusting cleaning out the vitamins.  I will never do that again.<br /><br />All of this said, I'm looking for another manufacturer of the stackable containers.  I really like the convenience they offer.  I can fill up the entire container for a week, but only take one with me daily instead of the entire stack.  That, to me, is awesome.  If I don't find a higher quality option or if the container breaks before I can find an alternative, I *might* buy another one.  But I'm a little stubborn and will only do that if I absolutely have to!  (And that is purely for the convenience [and size] it provides.)",1
1,The cologne I order was the wrong smell.  don't buy it because it is not fierce cologne.  I paid 65 dollars and received the wrong cologne and it was a huge waste of money! Don't buy it it is horrible!!!!!!,1

1,"I received a 3 oz sample of this and although I have the oiliest hair on earth (looks unwashed halfway through the day) this took all the grime out. Left my hair feeling awesome and clean and exceptionally shiny. I would buy this expensive product if it were not for the uncomfortable tingling/burning feeling it left on my scalp. It was really intense burning after I used it, and as my hair dried, the feeling got less and less however after 6 hours and my hair is now dry, my scalp still feels tingly and uncomfortable. It's unsettling to me and I have only read one review where this happened to someone else. I am therefore giving it away. Try at your own risk, I have only had this same burning tingling experience once before, and it was with Wen, another popular cleansing conditioner.",1
1,I try a lot of these types of product and this overpriced bottle is worthless and it did not work.,1

I love this particular fragrance and will stick with the regular pump lotion since it does not have parabens.

1,Didn't work for me. Not the best tool for a sore back. too much work to figure out how to use.,1

The flat iron arrived on time before I arrived to the United States, so I started using it immediately........ the flat iron didn´t get as hot as it should, I have very thin hair and I couldn´t straighten it even if I went through the same part 3 times, after that I touched my hair and it was barely hot, conclusion, the flat iron didn´t worked (many people in their reviews had the same problem). I try to give this flat iron a chance by getting used to it but it was impossible, I losed my free trial time with Amazon and it was impossible to contact the seller to make valid my two year guarantee, there were no telephone numbers neither a web site to contact them, nothing came inside the box, I had to contact Amazon explaining my problem and they kindly gave me the refund but I lost $20.00 dlls. of returning fees!!

No better or different than any other mascara I have used, except that it is more difficult to apply.",1
1,I am very disappointed on the twizeller I just bought it doesn't grip and hold the hair at all. Just a waste of money. I do not recommend this product at all,1
1.0,"Broke after only a few uses. Power cord we think, but hard to tell. I would not buy this again.",1
2,These stink really bad comin out of the package...my shipping took FOREVER! Almost 2 weeks! Some of the hairs on the brushes were all squiggly and out of place so I had to cut them off...there was a white substance that was coming off the brushes it kinda looked like dust or powder..my first thought was hoping they weren't used. Haven't used them yet bc I'm gonna clean them up really good! But I'm hoping I'll like them.,1
1,Ordered 2 and only one arrived in the package on Christmas Eve. Even tho packing slip says quantity 2 :(  really disappointed .....,1
1,Horrible.,1
1,I have tried it and am totally disappointed.  It does nothing.  That's a lot of money for nothing.<br /><br />Your return policy is a joke.  I'd like to have my money back.  Can you make that happen?<br /><br />Terrible product.  Deceitful advertising.  Maybe it will just take a law suit to get our money back.,1
1,Product  was expired when received.,1
1,This is not the real deal. Very very dissapointed,1
2,Way too strong and heavy.. Smells classy and expensive but perhaps better if never worn,1
2,Prefer the regular green tea SCENT spray (not the perfume which is too strong). This has too flowery and not light enough.,1
1,"I bought this excitedly thinking it'd put an end to the constant straightening of my hair but I have to say it did nothing of the sort. I have long, thick, wavy, frizzy hair and followed the intructions exactly as it said. After blowdrying and straightening my hair, yes, of course it was straight, but when I woke up the next day the frizz and waves were back. I tried on 3 different occasions and it failed each time. I would agree with other reviewers that it leaves a kind of sticky/greasy feeling in the hair. Useless stuff.",1
1.0,"Nothing even remotely Extreme Hold about this hair gel product. Average would be a more than generous description.  Will not stand up to high humidity.  If you are seeking a true, long lasting Spiking Gel, look elsewhere.",1
1,I used this same one in a hotel in Vegas and it was amazing my hair looked just like I had it done at the salon. So excited I bought two one for me one for my sister. Mine was borrowed by a friend never got back ordered another one this one was defective bad!!!  I literally used it the very first time fresh out of the box and I swear there were sparks coming out of the outlet. Unplugged scared thought it was the outlet plugged it in a different outlet sparks again OMG anyway I tossed it in the garbage wasn't worth me packaging and going to post office etc and I was on vacation and had to go buy a new one while on vacay. I loved it but the electrical problem was not good!,1
1,"I had read other reviews about this product purchased from the seller \\""Potential Dynamix\\"" in which people complained about the product quality.  The first brush head I used had a very loose head, which I assumed was just a single product defect.  Then, the second brush head literally came apart as I was using it.  I contacted Procter and Gamble and they asked me to mail the brush heads in for replacement.  They just contacted me and informed me that the product was a counterfeit.  I could not tell at all, as the packaging and product itself was not visibly any different from the actual brush head, other than it completely came apart after use.  Again, stay away from this product as sold by \\""Potential Dynamix\\"".  (Note: \\""Potential Dynamix\\"" has since changed their name to \\""DAB Nutrition\\"")",1

1,"I was looking to buy a facial cleansing system that would slough off dead skin, remove blackheads, and reduce pores. Boy, was I disappointed. I tried to give this product a fair shot, because I know miracles don't happen over night, but I've seen absolutely NO change in the last month of use.<br /><br />The shine reducing cleanser completely stripped the oil from my face and left my skin feeling 'tight', while the vibrating brush head did less for massaging my skin than I could have done with my fingertips. Since I began using it, I've had MORE breakouts than before, which I can only assume is because my body is trying to replace the oil the cleanser stripped away. I think I'll just go back my my old routine.",1
1,Brush is too big and messy.  It causes lashes to clump together and you can't apply from lash line to ends...the brush is just too big.  It doesn't lengthen or define - it's just too messy.  An awful product.,1
1,The end plug keeps coming off everytime i try to unplug it from the machine. It splits halfway through and revels the spring loacated inside the cord. I really cant complain about the foot pedal because it was only $8.00 and free shipping. All in all I will not be using the product or services provided by the manufacturing company of this tattoo machine foot pedal. Good day.,1
1,"This toothbrush worked fine for about 6 months until it spontaneously lost its ability to charge, and therefore became unusable. Unfortunately because of their proprietary charger there's not much you can do once this happens.  I wrote Oral-B customer support and they never responded to me.

1,"had older set made by someone else. they worked great for YEARS, just falling apart. Bought these for wife that has a bad hand from a  car wreck. They do not warm up. They say 30 sec, tryed up to 2 mins on high in a brand new microwave oven. If you left these on the dash of our truck they would get warmer. it was not about the price as don't care about the cost, just want them to work. We know how it should be having used this type for over 8 years. They just plain don't work, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY&#60; DO NOT BUY. I am going to try to return as they are junk.",1
2,"I was really hoping this scent would be true to it's name, and that it would smell of redcurrant and basil.  Wearing it, I smell neither one of those scents (both of which I love); it just smells generically perfumey on me.  I love the idea of a redcurrant/basil scent, but this is not it, and it's way too expensive for just a generic perfume scent.  I would pay $75 for redcurrants and basil, but this just isn't it.",1
2,"I originally thought this product was a larger face mask that covers a larger area of the face, but it is not. It only covers a very small area fitted securely around the nose. After about a week, I liked it better as it didn't crease my face as much as the previous larger face mask. The downside is that it is already broke, making air wheezing noises, and now has to be replaced.",1
1,FAKE! Beware!!!!!!!! Compared it to 2 brushes at local Nars counter & it is definitely fake.,1

But, this is NOT the product that was used on my feet over the years when I was getting a pedicure.  It's okay, but the thicker stuff was amazing!  I wish they would go back to there original formula!  Definitely not the same stuff! If a reviewer hadn't said to put it on dry feet, I would have sent it back!  That tip at least makes it work.But it<br />is NOT the wonderful miracle it once was!",1
1,This was a waste of money.  I have very curly hair and it made my hair dry and flyaway.  Cheap products in a general store worked better than this product.  Don't waste your money.,1

1,"OK, so after reading all of the reviews on this product my wife buys one. Well, in about 6 weeks the iron won't heat anymore. Sent it in got a new one because of the 2 year warranty (cost $10.00 for shipping & handling plus they wanted $3.00 for themselves). She used it about 4 months and then the little spring breaks. Having used other curling irons over the years and having had to replace the springs, we thought to call Conair and have them send us a replacement spring, about a $.10 item which takes about 60 seconds to replace. Well, they no longer sell the springs. The wanted to have us pack it up again and spend another $10.00 for shipping AND send them $3.00 to boot. Who are they kidding? What kind of service are they giving their customers. I will never buy another Conair product. I gave this product only one star because I couldn't go any lower.",1

1,"This worked pretty well for a few months, but then died. The motor will spin if you take the \\""blade\\"" off but then what's the point. I've washed it thoroughly, replaced the batteries, etc. It just won't work. Pretty cheap.",1
1,"Let me tell you something....THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK.  So, for years and years (pretty much my whole life) I've just used \\""cheap\\"" shampoo....Suave, Pantene Pro-V, whatever my Mom bought from Target etc.  My hair has never looked beautiful and voluminous and shiny like some girls I know.  I almost always wear my hair up, so it never really made a difference to me.  Well, I saw the infomercial for Wen and it was extremely convincing.  The girls' hair in the commercials looked AMAZING.  It said if you used Wen, you would have shiny, frizz-free, voluminous hair.  I bought it, was really excited to use it, and.....NO DIFFERENCE whatsoever.  My hair is normally SHINE-FREE, matte, boring, ugly, FRIZZY, THICK, and DRY.  Wen made me believe there sulfate-free shampoo would make my hair beautiful and that my problem all along was the sulfates in regular shampoo.  I used Wen on multiple occasions, and there was NO difference, and I mean NONE.  I even tried to help out the product- I completely stopped using a blow-dryer (for weeks I didn't touch a blow dryer) and would just let it air dry as I drove to school/work, I completely stopped using a hair straightener for weeks and weeks.  Just using the product and letting it air dry I thought would at least help it do what is claimed it would do.  It DID NOT, \\""make my hair bounce back to life,\\"" it did not give it more volume, it DID NOT make it shiny and beautiful in the sun.  And the worst part?  When I used it and would smell my hair, it smelled METALLIC..... (!?!?!  At least make my hair smell as amazing as it smells when they use the expensive stuff from the salon.  It smelled weird.  I used the product just as it said to, with 4-6 pumps per. 4 dif sections of my hair.  This product is a major bummer.  Maybe they're onto something about shampoo not having sulfates in it that \\""strip\\"" the hair (they compare it to using laundry detergent in your hair), and that shampoo should be sulfate free, but I just didn't see any results that were different than using Garnier Fructis (or similarly affordable shampoo products  on my hair.  :  i even tried, like I said, to NOT use a blow dryer AT ALL, NOT use a hair straightener, wash my hair EVERY OTHER DAY (instead of every day to).  Then I would look at my hair in the sun to see if it was as beautiful and bouncy and shiny as some other girls whos hair I envy.  But, nope.  Still the matte boring shine-less hair I have and have always had.  Let me also say I rarely color my hair, so it's not like it's \\""damaged\\"" from color because I rarely even color my hair!!  And while I'm talking about color, I have gotten red color before in my brown hair and after I came home from the salon, and was washing it with shampoo in the shower, I would just see TONS Of red color just washing down the drain.  It was depressing, so maybe Wen (being sulfate-free), helps with maintaining color vs. a cheaper shampoo, but I wouldn't know because I don't have color in my hair.  They did say on the commercial it helps maintain color).    Overall, I was really sad I spent money on this product because it did not give me any beautiful shine whatsoever.  I seriously can't believe it's getting any good reviews at all because my hair still looked matte and shine-less when I used it, (AND STILL FRIZZY!!!).  I don't care how expensive a hair product is, if it HAD made me look like the girls in the commercial, I would spend whatever on it, no matter how expensive, but it didn't take away the frizz, didn't make it shiny, and made it smell metallic and weird.    :  Major sad face for being born with the hair I'm born with and Wen not working like it said it would.  By the way, as a side note, I just wanted to say it's not just Wen that doesn't work.  I just bought ANOTHER expensive \\""sulfate-free\\"" shampoo called S Factor, about $30 for a regular sized bottle, and I see no difference after using THAT product EITHER.  All these stupid expensive shampoo companies, I just don't know, you know?I just see no difference, so I'm going to save my money and just use (see following):   All that's worked for me is to literally just spray on a \\""shine-product\\"" after using regular ol' shampoo and conditioner (I use something from Fantastic Sams called Spray Shine Finish.  I used something a long time ago from Garnier or some cheap company similar to that where you basically just spray a shine onto you hair after you're done blow-drying and straightening it (or however you style it), then you get immediate shine in the sun and it just looks great.  That's really the only time my hair has looked shiny and pretty.",1

1,I could hardly wait to get this nifty product. It looked like the most amazing gadget ever- how did I ever live without one? Well I wished I would have just kept my money and stuck my cotton swabs in an empty pickle jar.  This thing is junk. It does not work right- since it does not actually dispense without a fair bit of muscle and anger directed at product (and the lid does not fit correctly )we remove our swabs from the top. Once ours is empty I am going to leave it on the doorstep of someone I don't like.,1
1,Update: battery still great but once again walh fails to deliver a good product. Thing started rusting after a few months of use. For the second time I am officially done buying wahl products.  I used to hate wahl clippers and swore them off two years ago. It just so happens I was at Walmart looking for a pair of clippers I had bought in the past (apparently discontinued) and couldn't find them. Against my will I bought wahl. This thing is awesome and powerful and more importantly for me is that it cuts super close to my scalp because I shave my head. Love these things so far! I will update my post if they turn south like my last pair.,1

So far, only her legs have shown this problem, but it's still a major inconvenience.<br />I have even attempted to exfoliate that area on my legs, but hasn't helped at all.<br />As nice as it was to have a wax kit that was organic and water-soluble, I will not be buying this again, nor will I be recommending it to anyone.<br />Giving it two stars because, well, it DID yank the hair out.",1

Mine doesn't smell citrusy at all, but more like the most overly sweet cupcake possible. It was quite nauseating and I could barely keep it on my lips, so I'd end up rinsing it off. Used it a handful of times and returned to my Mary Kay lip scrub which is much more expensive but much better quality.",1

If the spout pops up during transit there is nothing stopping the bubble bath from freely flowing out.<br /><br />I had ordered several items along the bubble bath all of which arrived in a large box. Upon opening the box I discovered that the entire contents, 12 oz, of the bubble bath emptied during transit. Everything had bubble bath liquid on it. A box with an amp took the brunt of it, it's side was soaked in bubble bath. I had to return a couple items that couldn't be easily cleaned or that I didn't want to risk damage like the amp. Also when I first picked up the box to bring it inside and then set it on the counter to open, I couldn't see nor tell that the middle of the box of soaked with bubble bath. So I had a couple of spots in my house to clean up after I found what had happened.<br /><br />I will not order this product again. Why chance it. It gave me much more work than it was worth. If you are dead set on ordering I'd advice ordering it with something that could easily be cleaned up in case you experience a similar incident; like diapers since they come in shrink wrap bundles anyway.",1

I shouldn't have to use it more than once to get the result nor should the light have to be just right and I didn't even get the expected result after following directions and applying it twice...I could wait another month to maybe see more vibrancy like other reviewers have mentioned but I should just stick with the salon and not waste any more time or money on disappointing results...maybe my hair is just too difficult for such a huge change with at home kits.",1
2,This is not like the original massage oil. It's sticky and without much fragrance. I threw it in the trash.,1
1,Old and dried out,1
1,"Very strong, not very pleasant smell",1
2,"I bought this newer Panasonic shaver because the cost of replacing the foil and blades of my previous  5-blade Panasonic cost almost as much as this new, less expensive shaver.    The shave takes a little longer than the higher-end unit, but that's OK. What I am NOT happy about is that water has leaked into the LED display in just two months of use. I shave in the shower and then rinse the shaver under the showerhead - nothing contrary to instructions.    What bums me is that I have to pay the return shipping and wait for two weeks for Panasonic to replace the unit.",1
2,takes a while to groom oneself with this particular item.,1
2,It wasnt what was said,1
1,"I bought this product for my girlfriend, who has had dark bags under her eyes ever since having her first child (probably from lack of sleep). She used it every day and night for 6 weeks, and saw NO improvement at all. Don't waste your money.",1
2,"I thought it would highlight my colored hair which is medium brown, but I can''t even tell where I applied these highlights.  I left the product on the full amount of time, but no highlights for me.",1
1,Will not buy this product again since I learned it is NOT cruelty free.  I am ashamed of myself for believing Clinique was cruelty free and not verifying it.,1
1,it has been over a 6weeks and I still not have it. the computer said that had 5 in stock and it was on its way. then I got an email saying that they had to order it. if they have 5 in stock why did they have to order it. then they said that had a problem with custom not once but twice. now the coumper says that they have 5 in stock an I have not  gotten a email saying it is on the way. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE.,1
1,Did not glow.,1
1,"This stuff was just awful for me. I had high expectations after reading reviews, but here's the rub: It doesn't rub in at all. It is impossible to blend, so you can't get a natural look. And this is after my routine of cleansing, toner, essence, exfoliant and moisturizer, so my skin is plumped, hydrated and ready for application. I just wanted a gentle foundation that would allow my skin to look like skin and breathe while covering redness/spots. This did not irritate, but it made me look like crap. Total mask-face, and suffocating! It's a bummer because of the price. My search for an HG foundation ended with $20 Korean BB, VIP Gold by Skin:79, which is incredible - dewey finish, blend-able, looks like skin, great coverage without breaking out my super sensitive and acne-prone skin.",1
2,I didn't care for it.,1
2.0,not for individuals with sensitive skin,1
2,"Don't waste your money on this hangnail trimmer.  It does not do a good job of trimming hangnails.  There are other products that work better, such as the regular Tweezerman cuticle cutters.",1
1,"I am beyond imaginable ANGRY, at whoever came up with the name BALDING CLIPPERS.    DO not use this crap to cut your hair bold short.  I have been cutting my hair for 5 years, and never experienced, what I have experienced just now. My had is bleeding, from \\""Balding\\"", I have now a bunch of cuts on my head everywhere, and i have a job interview tomorrow.    These clippers are extremely sharp and cannot possibly be used for balding without the guard. I am returning this S*** as soon as I am done with the review",1
1,"Its too soft. Doesn't brush my hair. I have thick hair an was looking for a brush similar to the Avon classic one, that I recently lost. Didn't work out at all.",1
2,"I personally did not like this water pick as it is very messy to use and launches water in all directions. This could be because of operator error, but even with the pressure turned all the way down, it did not help.  It did do the job its intended to do, but I feel flossing still does a better job.",1
1,Exploded inside from the first use<br />And I wasted my time reading how to use it<br /><br />Didn't last one day afterall,1
1,Doesn't last. Cheaply made. Crap. Won't buy Wahl products again. The battery is good for just a few minutes that's it.,1
2,The quality is nice but I don't like the verity of the brushes I only use like 3,1
1,"This guard falls off the clipper too easily while cutting hair and can cost you a client. The vibrations and cutting of the clippers slowly but surely tears away at the guard, I do not recommend you use them for Wahl clippers, I honestly don't know what clippers you're even supposed to use them for if they don't work with the ones they were specifically designed for?!",1
2,"This face wash did nothing to my combination acne prone skin, and I feel like I just wasted 30 dollars.<br />It had a slightly odd chemically odor, and I tried using it for a month every day twice a day, and I did not see any \\""decongestive\\"" action in my skin. I regret wasting my money on this, but I guess someone had to try it.",1
1,"Disappointed in this sunscreen, as it is far too greasy.  I have been using California Baby and Blue Lizard products, which are thick and pasty white.  I was hoping this would be a solution, but it was a waste of money.",1

I tried warming the wax with my hands, and even the hair dryer. Nothing works. 0% adhesion. even post it notes sticks better.<br />Shame on you for shipping out old goods to your customers. Says so much about your service.",1
2,"When touching the scalp, not comfortable at all.",1
2,"Things seemed well with these the first three days of use. They weren't horrible. They didn't fit very well but I really did feel like they worked good.  I can tell after 4 days my teeth are very white!  However, today I had an interesting experience that I hadn't had before.  My gums were burning while I had them on.  I took them off early (after only 25 minutes) because I couldn't take the burning anymore.  When I took them off I looked in the mirror and my bottom gums were sore, swolen, and WHITER than my teeth!  UGH!  They still hurt a few hours later.  I probably will not use these ever again, nor will I recommend them to anyone!  I think I'll stick with whitening strips!!!",1
1,"What a complete waste of time & money! My hair is fine w/ a medium curl and a little bit of frizz along the hairline. I didn't see any difference after using this product and I followed the instructions to the letter. Also the shampoo & conditioner that comes in this pack are so small, I've been to hotels where the bathroom amenities are bigger! Really, I can't emphasize enough...don't waste your money!",1
1,"please do not buy this product, not good at all.thank you",1
1,Don't waste your money on this product. :-(,1
1.0,"stopped working after 2 hours, mid-tattoo, luckily i had a backup. won't buy this again. you get what you pay for.",1
1,Scam. This was a knockoff and not a real clarisonic.  Called clarisonic when the replacement heads didn't fit right. Gave them the code on the item. Fake!!,1
1.0,did not work,1
2,Thought this was a good deal.  But the brush hairs are really hard.  This is not a quality brush and I will not buy it again.,1
2.0,Didn't curl my hair. It was difficult to use.,1
2,I really wanted to love this but just can't. I gave it 2 stars bc it's cute and I like the color. But will be going back to my cheap Revlon curler. This one is much harder to use than I expect and pinches my eyelids. I can avoid pinching if I am really really careful but never had this issue with my old curler bc I don't have the time or patience to deal with this one every morning.,1
2,This product is not for me.  I don't like that it's a liquid base.  I would prefer something that's more like a powder.,1
1,after one day of use the area that comes in contact with the skin became overheated<br />returned easily,1
1,These brushes shed and shed and shed ... I have to constantly be taking hair from the brushes off my face or my husband has to point out that I have the hair from the brushes on my face. I washed them and that only made things worse.,1
1,Replaced Oil of Olay Regenerest (25.00) with this product and after 5 weeks ran to the drugstore for more Oil of Olay.  Did not work at all for me.,1
1,"Turned my hair orange--would not recommend! Also, it is very difficult to have nicely separated highlights without using foils. And for long hair, you really need more highlight product than is in this kit.",1
1,"I was excited after reading reviews to try this under my eyes for the lines and wrinkles I am getting. I have NOT felt or noticed ANY difference at all! Nothing! I have used it right away in the morning under makeup, and use it before bed. I would think using it twice a day I would have noticed SOMETHING! \\""Maybe\\"" just \\""Maybe\\"" it will help prevent new lines, but I bet ANY under eye cream, even from a Dollar store would do the same.",1
1,I wasn't even able to get one use out of these. They fell apart while on my fingers...almost like they were dry rotted.,1
1,ok so this is NOT hair chalk.. it's regular artist's pastels. lucky for me i use pastels and can tell the difference. additionally this was suppose to come with a hair braid ponytail maker but it did NOT. what a scam and a rip off. amazon needs to remove this product ASAP as it is misleading and I'm getting the BBB involved for false advertising and claims.,1
1,The polish is dull,1
1,arrived damaged.,1
1,"Commodity use period is too short.It will expire in half a year.The emulsion texture is too thick,and color is too white.",1

2,"I used it on me and my three girls. One of my daughters it burned her so no more usage on her. It smells horrible. Whoever said it's a pleasant smell either loss their sense of smell, loves the smell of garbage mixed with methanol or is getting paid to say so.

1,"i always used this perfume and i love it , so i know how it smells like , but this one is definitely fake and i hate it .<br />DISAPPOINTED",1
1,"Purchased this product when Clarins discontinued the Total Body Lift product I loved. Well, this one does absolutely nothing for me so I had to search for companies who had the Total Body Lift left over in stock. Just did another search for the Total Body Lift and can't find it anywhere anymore. :(<br />My cellulite is on my legs and arms. I work out 4-5x a week (yes, I even lift light weights 2 of those x per week) & wear a size 2 or 4 or XS, so it isn't that I'm a couch potato I just have a big problem with cellulite. At this point I am lost for any solution because none of the other products I've tried have been nearly as successful as the Total Body Lift. Sadly the package for the High Def product says it has almost the same ingredients as the Total Body Lift but there is a significant difference between the results I've seen after using at least 2 bottles of this product. Yep, I kept trying in hopes of eventual success.<br />I'm writing this because I'm at a total loss for a good product to truly help me with my cellulite.",1
1,On a second time I tryed to use this UV light lamps wouldn't work at all or only one lamp would light up. After i tryed to return it the Blue Planet woldn't sent me a free return barcode or anything like it as it says on amazon.com return policy. And on top of that they charged me RE STOCK FEE afound 25 dollars witch they subtracted from my refund! So returns not as easy as they say!,1
1,Got the blade refill for my razor and it broke almost immediately after using.  Stick with the name brand - NO AFTERMARKET.  Not worth the money!,1
2,Are you kidding me? I willfully electrocute my face everytime I use this gadget.  I don't like using it at all and I use it as a prop for jokes...I cannot believe people would use this and face the tv camera and say it made their skin smoother.  I will use a cool flat iron first before I use this on my face again. This is not what the institutional machine does--the real McCoy gives you a feeling that you are being lightly massaged on the skin while the muscles underneath twitches without pain. This product however is a portable capital punishment and no results. I am embarassed that I bought one.,1
1.0,This item has never worked well.  Now It is functioning so badly that I cannot use it.  The edges of my nails do not get the light to cure the polish.  I have not changed anything in the process.  I will be contacting the manufacturer.  I hope they are receptive to replacing it.,1
1,"I have sensitive skin, and have had bad reactions to deodorant or ocean water, but never have I had an experience this horrific, and never have I had a bad reaction to a hair removal product. I used it on my legs and under arms and after only leaving the cream on for a couple minutes, my skin was burning. My legs have several little red dots on them, along with redness under my arm pits, that all sting like a bee and ich like a rash. The day after I used the cream, the burns on my legs were an open layer of skin that had peeled off, two days after I used the cream it seems as if my legs are heeling with those open wounds now scabing. My arm pits are still red and it hurts to touch, imagine how applying deodorant feels, I would never recommend this product to ANYONE who still wants nice, non-burnt skin. And on top of all that, it didn't even remove my hair, so now I have to shave on top of my chemical burns if I feel like leaving the house.",1
1,The product streaks very badly upon application. Did not look natural. Was very disappointed and threw the product away. Would not order product again.,1
1,Bought the lower end water pic $25 weak spray so I ordered this model and it is weak also  Very disappointed  looking for a different brand   Would not recommends his or buy another one  Crap,1
2.0,"What I received was not the Turbie Twist brand but some off-brand, in generic-type packaging.  I have purchased Turbie Twist before and what I received was not the same fabric; it was visually different plus it felt much lighter than the original Turbie Twist.  I was disappointed that I did not receive what I had ordered, and initially thought I had purchased something looking like Turbie Twist by mistake.  They were intended as stocking stuffer gifts and I will not be using them myself so I don't know if they will perform the same or not.",1
2,"I was very happy with the way the pick itself worked but not so much with being able to take it on and off the facuet.  Unfortunately the sink where it fit was also for company and I needed to remove it on occasion.  That proved to be very difficult to do and ended up not even being able to get it back on the facuet, the adapter broke.  If you can leave it on it is a great product, otherwise I would buy one that sits on the counter, which I just did, so ended up spending more money than I wanted.",1
1,"Didn't seem to work very well. Was stinky after a few hours of first use. After one full day of use I developed an unfortunate under arm rash, which cleared up after washing the deodorant off. Throwing away and trying another brand.",1
1,"It came with no instructions on how to remove them and it was so hard to remove and it tore my skin in several places, it was very painful.",1
2,"The kids loved the fizzy-ness of the bubble bombs, but unlike the liquid Mr. Bubble, these bombs created no lasting bubbles.",1
1,Sucks,1
2,"The product is great, but the bottle was shipped to me with a broken nozzle, so I can't even use it. Yaaaaaayyyyyy.",1
1,I noticed it when my dentist told me that my dentine feels noticeably softer after at a regular check up.  It also works for about 2 hours that's it.  I'd say go with something else.,1
2,If my ridged chipping peeling problem is due to dryness this did not help but did smooth out my cuticles and certainly smells good. So guess I would say it did not perform as promised.,1
1.0,Burned my scalp immediately upon applying. I have colored my hair many times and have never had that reaction. Will not buy this brand again.,1
2,I gave this as a gift and as soon as they opened the package the helmet gaurd fell off. This product is a great idea but badly put together.,1
1,"This product is worthless, it pulls out more hair than it cuts, in my opinion this is nothing less than a piece of junk. I wouldn't recommend anyone buying this product.",1
2,"The tanning oil itself is fine, with a nice smell and texture.  However, the \\""continuous spray\\"" bottle works poorly if at all!  Usually, the first time I depress it, some lotion comes out, but the spray peters out quickly, and subsequent attempts at using the bottle barely even get lotion to trickle out!  This would be much better in a lotion form or even just a tradition spray design.",1
2,"Let me back up and tell you what's good about this toothpaste. It's fluoride-free so young children won't get fluorosis from it. (If you aren't aware of the problem with fluoride toothpaste for children, read the small print on popular brands. It warns against letting children swallow it. But children will swallow anything sweet, won't they?)<br /><br />Furthermore, this product contains &#34;no artificial flavors, sweeteners, preservatives or dyes&#34; and also &#34;no gluten, propylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate.&#34; However, it does contain ingredients from corn and possibly birch, so persons with allergies to one or both of those will want to avoid it.<br /><br />The ingredients on the box are listed in small type that I cannot read so I went to the manufacturer's website. Here they are: Glycerin, PDO, water, hydrated silica, xylitol, benzyl alcohol, carrageenan, natural flavor, and citric acid. Wait! What's PDO? Well, Tom's says it's made from corn, a a further look shows that PDO is 1,3 propanediol and is sourced from fermented corn sugar. I looked on another site and saw that it is considered safe although it is classified as a skin irritant by the National Library of Medicine HazMap. I was still uneasy about this ingredient so I looked it up in Wikipedia and found that it is commonly used as an industrial chemical. It is produced in several ways; the method involving corn is conversion &#34;from corn syrup effected by a genetically modified strain of E. coli.&#34; That's not very comforting.<br /><br />And the other ingredients? Well, benzyl alcohol can cause allergic reactions in some people. Although considered safe by the FDA, I read elsewhere that in the European Union it is classified as toxic or harmful when used &#34;around the mouth.&#34; And according to Wikipedia, benzyl alcohol is toxic to neonates (newborns). And then there's carrageenan, a recent topic of controversy on some websites. As for the scientists, studies disagree as to whether carrageenan &#34;triggers gastrointestinal tract inflammation or contributes to tumor promotion.&#34; And while the evidence is inconclusive, I question putting this ingredient in a product for toddlers.<br /><br />Tom's of Maine is a respected brand. It has been a subsidiary of Colgate-Palmolive since 2006. Beyond that, I can only point out that word natural is frequently used very loosely in advertising.<br /><br />As for the taste, I would describe it as more like grapefruit than grapes. I am probably more sensitive than many people and I found this terribly bitter. No doubt some children like it. But personally, I would not give this product to a young child.rageenan &#34;triggers gastrointestinal tract inflammation or contributes to tumor promotion.&#34; And while the evidence is inconclusive, I question putting this ingredient in a product for toddlers.<br /><br />Tom's of Maine is a respected brand.

1,"I really don't understand the hype. Came from China so didn't mind the wait in shipping, that was a given I'm always in search for the next product for eyelashes,when lash extensions became costly and damaging, then to expensive eye serums that never worked for me. I received this about a week ago. Can't say anything but disappointed. Started with the serum, then layered the fibers on top. The results were a dry, brittle, spider look that flaked onto my under eyes and cheeks. After using it on trial to see what it looked after errands I ran on a weekend afternoon. I saw my lashes had gone straight and to my original stubby form and fibers disappeared,this was only after a couple hours. I wasn't pleased with them anyway before leaving the house.",1
1,The items I recovered are not what is pictured<br />I received pink bows and black hello kitty's<br />They also look to be extremely low quality.<br />I will probably never use them.<br />Do not buy,1
1,"The best fibre lash extensions mascara is by Cherry Blooms. I've tried and tested most of them already.

1,"Because of these razors(used it once), my face will hurt for at least 5 more shaves, I got excited with the price and bought a lot of them, I only used one once, I will donate the other ones, meaning that I spent $59 for ONE SHAVE.",1
1,I had to return this item. I had tingling feeling when I applied it on my face. Does not clean up blackheads.,1
1.0,OK I brought two jars of this stuff and let me tell you the smell is amazing. So minty and fresh and clean. This stuff however doesn't work. It works for a little while because the ingredients in it swell up the tissue of your rear to give it a smoother more plump look but it fades over time. I did have a booty before I started this but only 34 inches. I noticed no change with this over time. But I can tell you my butt never felt softer. If you look at other Some other customer reviews you will notice that this is the only item they ever reviewed. This seem so suspect to me. I gained a bigger booty by doing squats everyday. This product comes with instruction that tell us to do squats.<br /><br />To keep in mind I never believed the pictures but whatever. Try it if you want to but keep in mind I gain a little then a lot with squats so whatever.,1
2,I do not know how is it work yet. Still it is very small compared to its price. I never thought it will be in s such small size. I would not buy it even for 10 $.,1
2,"It doesn't really do the job but it's ok. I tried sharpening it but doesn't come out looking like a pencil, just a cracked up piece of wood.",1
2,"I have thick hair (both volume and the hair strands themselves) and this product just can't provide enough hold. It's a shame because I really like the consistency, fragrance and price. But, even after applying and combing through my hair, my hair quickly becomes unruly looking. I confess to having very difficult-to-manage hair, so hopefully others will have better luck.",1
1,I don't think it is authentic. Regret buying it. It gave me a lot of pimples and it is not what I anticipated.,1
2,"Soft, just like at the barber, but the strands come off pretty easily. You get the sense that you are replacing your own cut hair, with the strands left on you from this duster.",1
2,I was dissapointed with this product. It made the ends dry. The product is leave in. After a few minutes I wanted to wash it off.,1
1,"love the water pik but second time i have to buy the same one because the plastic holder that holds the pik has broken now on both of them...i am very reluctant buying a third one though i use it everyday, once broken you cannot keep the pik level and therefore water goes everywhere...it's a mess.!",1
1,"I thought I would try something different.  I have been using Mary Kay for years and love the quality, but it is expensive.  I just thought I would give this a try...especially for 4.38.  The color looked really pretty online.  But when I got it, the color looked kinda orange.  I still tried to use it...thinking maybe I could tone it down and make it pinker with a gloss.  But that's too much trouble for regular use.  And it didn't look good anyway.  I threw it away!<br />So much for that idea.",1

1,Horrible.  Didn't melt worth s*** & ruined my wax pot,1
1,"This product was just horrible for me.... almost made me bald in less than 10 days!!!<br /><br />I got it because i had a small spot  where my hair was thinning ... after a week of sporadic use it literally ruined my hair, the healthy ones thinning, shedding the healthier ones  and paradoxically leaving my thinning spot identical for some reason ... I went into depression and still going through phases now.<br />I wish I could sue those guys ...  I did a lot of research on this and the side effects ...didn&#34;t expect this.<br /><br />Just BS.",1
2,In the picture the color looks brighter but when i got it is was a dull blue. Not a greenish color like it looks.,1
1,I have ordered this product direct from Arbonne and have been very happy with it.  I decided to order from Amazon because<br />it was a little cheaper in price.  I thought I would be receiving the same set but was very disappointed.  The box it came in was<br />torn apart and looked like some of the product had been used also smaller container for the face cream.  One bottle was<br />missing a lid.  Will not order this product from Amazon again.,1

2,"I bought this because I had a good experience with a previous purchase from Walmart.  This order, however, is turning out to be unsatisfactory because the bristles on the brush head I'm currently using, are busily falling out before they are becoming worn out enough to replace the head.

2,Maybe I don't get it right how to put it on but even after watching YouTube videos on how to stick these rhinestones they don't stay on for more than 5-10 mins... Don't waste your money and time on these...they are useless if doing it on your own nails,1
2,"Great smell, but sure does not last long.  Can't we do better than this for the price?  Come on Michael Kors!",1
1,Ultra-low price should have tipped me off. No lot # or exp. date either. Do not purchase from amazon.com or anyone other than TendSkin themselves.,1
1,I was disappointed in this product.  There has been no whitening that I can tell after I have used it for two weeks.,1
1,"clumps, they sent me full refund. much prefer  Bobbi Brown or Mabelline",1
2,Smells horrible.,1
2,"Just discovered the Vital C skincare line which I love and can't believe what a difference it makes!  However, not a fan of the eye recovery gel.  I don't think it does anything different or better than my Clinique.",1

2,"couldn't get a little lather out of this. so no, not for me.",1
2,this hair is horrible after the first 2 weeks it start shedding and tangling really bad. it doesn't look any better even if you wash it. I wouldn't recommend this hair at all,1
1,"This product didn't change my hair color at all, and my white hairs are just as white as they were before I tried dying them!  To add to insult, this product stained my scalp more than any other dye I've used.  My hair is medium brown with reddish highlights, and I have a decent amount of white hair that I want to cover. I thought that the Red Brunette would be the closest to my natural color, so I gave it a shot.  I followed the directions except that I'm not able to heat my hair, so I left the stain in for an hour instead of the 15 to 20 minutes as directed.  I've tried many hair stains that recommend using heat, and they all still worked even if I didn't heat my hair.  What a total waste of time and money!  For less than half of the price, I can buy the Adore line of hair stains that have worked much better for me and have a wider selection of colors.",1
1,This item sucks  badly do not even dare buying,1
2.0,Made my face totally peel and get dry and crusty. It eventually went away but I'm not using it again.,1
2,"I purchased this gift basket as part of my wife's anniversary present, a small part but a part nevertheless. The item was on time and gift wrapped as I had specified, but to my dismay, all the original bath and body works prices were still on each item! Not to mention it was missing the body splash. I am very unhappy, do not buy from this seller.",1
2,I purchased this thinking it will be less oily. Yes it is not oily but did absolutely nothing for me. Its too expensive for the results achieved. I am considering trying another product line going forward,1
1,"I have used Vanicream in the jar and Vanicream lite lotion for years and love them, my lack of skin reaction and the moisturizing is very effective.<br /><br />I decided to try Vaniply as a winter moisturizer, and it's just awful for me.  I had increasingly severe itching and feeling of skin tightness each of the few days I used it, and they went away as soon as I stopped.  In my experience, this occurs with products that lower cortisol levels in the body, (Aquaphor healing ointment is another example, the bisabolol added to it promotes itching, but not Aquaphor original, which does not have this ingredient) gives me a reaction very similar to what happened with Vaniply.<br /><br />Bad feel going on, not smooth or soothing.  My first disappointment from an otherwise excellent and helpful line of products.",1
1.0,"These are gray as pictured, and not silver as described. I don't know why the description was changed from gray to silver, because these are definitely not silver. My hair is silver - white in some places - and I was looking for a light-colored bobby pin. These ones stand out in my hair as much as brown or black bobbies. The pins are fine as far as function goes, but they are quite dark in color.",1
1,"I bought this from a local Family Dollar store. I was sold on the \\""Super Hold\\"" statement on the package knowing full well that it would not live up to the claim because usually the better it claims to be, the worse it is. I put this in my hair and it dries relatively quickly and then disappears with no hold after two hours tops. It really isn't worth anything. I would pay a little more for something else if you see this on a shelf.",1
1,"Like many other reviewers, I have exceptionally sensitive, pale skin with roseacea.  I purchased this starter kit because I was excited about the idea of being able to sleep in this makeup.  I should have guessed that something wasn't going to work out quite right when the DVD that came with it showed the CEO of the company looking particularly orange--I was hoping it was just my TV.  When I tried the product on, I had several reactions.  First of all, the brushes that come with the set are incredibly cheap and rough, and left my skin red and irritated for some time afterwards.  Secondly, while the lighter option in the starter kit was suitable for my skin, if not ideal, the 'warmth' jar did not in any case look natural or flattering.  No problem, I skipped it.  Thirdly, I had difficulty getting the right coverage on my small bit of scarring, despite how easy the DVD told me it would be.  Fourthly, I didn't get the reassuring feel that makeup usually gives me--that sensation that I look better, that added piece of confidence.  I will stick with the Prescriptives that my dermatologist reccomends--it's not cheap, either, but it lasts quite a long time, does not irritate my skin, and makes me feel a little better dressed when I leave the house in the morning. <br /> <br />I sincerely reccomend that, before you purchase this set, you find a Sephora where you can give it a try and make sure that it's what you want it to be.  Also, invest in your own brushes.",1
2,"It does what it's supposed to do, I guess, but I don't like the fact that you have to wet it first. Also, the crystal part is loose and wobbly, and I find that annoying.",1
2,"The lighting on this does absolutely nothing. This is the first lighted mirror I've tried and I know it's cheap, but I wouldn't even bother. I ended up giving this to my daughters to play with.",1
1,made mine and my friend's hair even more dry..  this did not work for me. I will not be using this again.,1
2,"Why I get the wrong production!I order 5 coppertone oil free faces SPF50,but I get four SPF50 and one SPF30!",1
1,"This brush set isn't really good at all for applying eyeshadow.  The brushes aren't sized correctly and don't pick up shadow well.  The set is missing a firm, flat brush for packing shadow onto the lid.  It is also missing an angled eyeliner brush.  The blending brush is big and has an odd shape.  The crease brush is huge and not good for creases.  It just makes a mess.  Also, the envelope to hold the brush is a rough texture and gets dirty easily.  The ONLY brush I use is the highlight brush to apply my highlight shade and blend out the edges of my eyeshadow.  I occasionally use the smudge brush to smudge out eyeliner in a pinch, but it's scratchy and not quite the right shape.  Personally, I am happier investing in good quality brushes that are perfect for the job and not buying cheap brushes that don't cut it.  Yeah, good makeup brushes are expensive but they make a HUGE difference in how your eyeshadow comes out.<br /><br />I use:  Mac 239 or Urban Decay Good Karma brush (the one that comes with the Naked Palette) to pack on eyeshadow, the Mac 219 to smudge or define my crease, the mac 217 to blend.  Then I use the highlight brush from this set.",1
1.0,"Don't like the scent at all - way too strong for me, kind of reminds me of Este Lauder Youth Dew or something (waay too overpowering). But the little box is pretty.",1
2,"I do not recommend this product for anyone. The battery life is subpar at best; for example, I cannot utilize this product more than once on one charge. It is constantly dying mid-shave, thus I constantly must charge it. Because of this issue, I will likely never again buy another Remington product.",1
1,Arrived completely broken up and no seal on the plastic container.  The package was undamaged.  The taupe color appears to be good.  Have requested a replacement and I am sending it back.,1
1,Did not smell like the one I purchase at store at all.  It actually smelled ver weird.,1
2,This stuff didn't really do much for me except make my hair look dirty.  I have normal to fine dark brown hair with a little natural wave.,1
2,"I think the key to this product is strong water pressure.  When I used it at my old aptartment they worked really well, the scent was strong without being overpowering. In my new apt, which has considerably less water pressure, the tablets do not dissolve properly.  I ended up giving them to my friend who moved into my old place.",1
2,The scent is so strong that it gave me a headache after I used it for two days in a row.,1
1,"Not sure if I'm the only one experience this but I bought from QVC a long time ago barely see any product inside the tube.  I had to scrape the brush from side to side every time even when I first bought it.  But even recently, I bought it straight from their website and still the same thing happen.  It's the stingiest amount for such an expensive tube.  Every time I use now I have to put it in hot water to melt some out so it goes smoothly on my lashes.  It does lengthens when it first come on but will lump after a while.  I would not buy it again.",1
1.0,"After reading other reviews, I'm assuming I received a defective Bidet.  The bottle lid leaks, even when not in use.  The \\""spray\\"" end leaks.  The first time I used it, most of the water leaked on the floor.  The second time I put water in it, I set it on the counter and it leaked standing upright, soaking papers I had on the counter.  I know I cannot return a product such as this, but I would not recommend it with the experience I had.<br /><br />J. Michaels",1
2,"Looks nice, but avoid buying this product.  Nice idea to have it be more secure with the stud. However, it's a cheap material, and it doesn't fit right at all. It sticks out on the ear, and doesn't follow the contour of the ear at all. Mine easily broke.",1
1.0,The decals smeared as soon as I tried to apply a top coat. I honestly am disappointed.,1
1,"I HAVEN'T REALLY HAD A CHANCE TO TRY IT OUT IN AN EMERGENCY BUT DIDTRY IT IN A TEST.<br />FIRST- THERE IS NO ELECTRICAL CORD TO KEEP  IT PLUGGED IN AND CHARGED AND TOO MUCH WINDING IS NECESSARY TO CHARGE IT TO A USEABLE DEGREE. ALSO THE CHARGE DISSIPATES TOO QUICKLY AND THE SIDE BUTTONS ARE  DIFFICULT TO ACCESS WITH LARGE FINGERS. THE PRINT ON THE BUTTONS IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO READ ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE EYE PROBLEMS, (THE REASON I USE CAPS, SO DON'T RAG ON ME). IT'S ALSO SUPPOSED TO BE SOLAR CHARGEABLE SO I LEAVE IT ON MY DESK NEXT TO A WINDOW THAT GETS SUN BUT THAT DOESN'T HELP MUCH.. I BELEIVE A GOOD BATTERY POWERED WITH A PLUG IN OPTION WOULD BE BETTER AND THE COST OF HAVING EXTRA BATTERIES WOULD BE CHEAP INSURANCE DURING AN ACTUAL EMERGENCY.",1
1,"This wig is the right color, but very thin. The cap us made of the wrong mesh, which looks like a clothing mesh and is very clearly visible through the hair. It is a pale yellow. I have black hair so my hair shows through the scalp of this wig. The only way I will be able to wear this is to dye the mesh and a wig cap. Even then, I am debating on whether to cut some of the length and GLUE IT INTO THE HUGE GAPS. Very disappointing.",1
1,The oil works great. The brush not so much,1
1,"Only my opinion, your experience may differ...I used this product as soon as I got it, and it was one of the worst experiences I've had with hand sanitizer - in my opinion, it has the worst smell possible - a nose-stinging, very-very-very fake wanna-be citrusy-like smell...like something cooked up in a lab and never smell tested by anything human. The smell lingers for about two hours on the hands. I will remember this horrific smell for many years to come. The smell was so bad that it scared my family - they thought I had spilled some nasty chemicals in the kitchen.<br /><br />The product is now resting comfortably at the bottom of my city trash bin, waiting to be hauled to the landfill to no doubt be ostracized by the garbage around it because of the odor it exudes.<br /><br />Again, only my opinion...",1
1,"I cannot recommend this product. It did a very good job when it worked, but with a two year warranty, it should not have stopped in less than a year. Philips' customer service policy leaves a lot to be desired. Shipping is 7 to 10 business days, which we all know means at least two weeks. I had to speak with a supervisor because they were only going to send the handle, not the handle and charging base. They nor I have any idea whether it is the handle or base or both. I was told if the replacement handle wasn't the problem to call them back and they would send a charging base. When I explained that would take a month in shipping time, I was told that was their policy. The supervisor did finally agree to send both the handle and charging base. I asked why shipping time was so long when Amazon could have a new one to me in two days, and was told that was how Philips worked. Well, after I hung up, I placed an order for an Oral-B with Amazon and it will be here in two days. Had the Oral-B before and I was very happy with it. When it died, I thought I would try a Sonicare. Not a very good decision on my part.",1
1,"These 3x Dual Lense Flip-Up Magnifying Makeup Glasses were a total waste of money. I got them because I can't see to put on eye makeup without my glasses and I couldn't see to put on eye makeup with these glasses either. I got the strongest strength available, and still I could not see with them on. I would not recommend these for anyone.",1
2,The brush part doesn't stay in the place keeps falling out of the handle when I brush my hair. Not a good product.,1
1,I have been using this product for several months and initially thought it was the greatest product ever.  Made my hair shiny and silky.  Now my hair is falling out.  PLEASE be careful and watch the amount of hair you are losing now versus typical hair loss in a day.  I slowly started to notice it and now it is is coming out 10 or 12 strands at a time at the root.,1
1,This cream didnt do anything its all the same no difference i never lost an inch id rather workout than waste my money again.,1
1.0,I could not trust the bottle for it appeared opened and like someone could have squeezed<br />another product other than primer.  I did not trust its safety on my face. I will stick to<br />buying cosmetic products elsewhere.  Unsure of expiration date as well which is a problem.,1
1,"I'm not sure what the deal is with Murad products. I know that there is a seal of approval, but this is the second time I have ordered this product from Amazon, and the seal was clearly torn off. I've learned my lesson. Just because it is cheap, does not make it real. Buyer beware!",1
2.0,"Cheap smelling, good for a teen",1
1,"I had a Shu Uemura eyelash curler many years ago and thought it was great.  I bought others when it needed to be replaced because of the price.  I was willing to splurge a little and buy another when my 5 year old Paula Dorf eyelash curler gave it up.  I did not know that replacement pads are not sold.  But I was willing to let that go, since each pad was supposed to last 6 months.  Both of the included silicone pads split within 6 weeks.  In the 35 (!) years that I have been using an eyelash curler, I have never had such a lousy one. Some reviewers have speculated that they received knockoffs, but mine is imprinted with the brand on the bottom of the pads.",1
2,"I am a 53 year old woman with deep lines along my nose, and \\""parentheses\\"" between my eyebrows, along with smaller lines. I have been using this product for two and a half weeks. I was so excited after reading the glowing reviews. I see little, if any, difference so far, even in my little lines. Also, I would like to let people know, you WILL break out if you apply to oily areas. I have bought one more bottle to give it a longer time to work, but if I see no progress after that, I will buy no more, not at this price. Also, it would be NICE if they told you how much to use, and where to apply it (all over face or just problem areas) in their directions. Would not recommend it at this point, but if things change, I will be sure and post a new review.",1
2,"There are more effective products for less money if you are looking to curb \\""brassiness\\"" in your blonde or grey.  LUSH ships painfully slow.  Overall not worth it.",1
1,"I never write reviews, but If I can help someone by providing more information about this product, I thought I should. Someone else wrote in a review that this feels like 60grit sandpaper, and I didn't believe them. Well, they were exactly right. Someone else who gave a review said they thought bathing should be a penitent process, and I thought this was funny until I received this soap. There is absolutely nothing in the description that lists this as an extreme exfoliant bar, but instead says &#34;gently exfoliates&#34;. If gently means a surface akin to a pumice stone dipped in diamond dust then I guess so. This soap is ROUGH. Hope that helps some people. Probably good for hand soap to get stubborn tattoos off or something, but daily bathing with it is out for me.",1
1,I tried this twice to give it a chance. Both times it flaked onto my cheeks. If a mascara does that then it doesn't work.,1
1,This is one of the worst hair dyes I have ever used. It has little to no effect on my platinum blonde hair.,1

2,"smells like honey, for those who like sweet perfume",1
1,"Should have heeded the previous 1 star rating; they were generous. The product is labelled &#34;organic&#34; but there is not a single organic ingredient in the entire list. The ingredients consist of lovely items like methlyparaben, Dimethicone, IsoButyl Paraben, Butyl Paraben, etc, etc. As noted by the other reviewer, the product is unsealed...you open it and there it is...so contamination is a definite possibility. However, due to the laundry list of chemicals in the ingredients, I wouldn't be concerned with contamination, as no self-respecting bacteria, virus, or other living organism would dare inhabit this soup.<br /><br />My advice is to *avoid* this product as it is grossly mislabeled.",1

2,"I've tried several different brands of pore strips, the best ones being Biore and Clean& Clear.  I thought I'd give these a try bc of the low price and the relatively good reviews...well that was a waste of $18.  White the strips managed to pull out the tiny peach fuzz on my nose, the black heads stayed in place.  I still had some Biore strips, so I put one on after the Ponds strip failed, and the Biore got the black heads out faithfully.  Don't waste your money, get the more expensive brands bc they are worth the money.",1
1,Actually broke my hair really bad and stop using it after a couple of times.  Totally wasted my  money.,1
1,"First of all, the stuff absolutely reeks...smells like some little old lady's bad $2 perfume. Gag.  I'd throw it away based on that alone.  However, I toughed it out and wanted to see what it did for my hair...and it did zero.  No gloss, no color boost, no shine...zip, zero, zilch, nada.  Off to the recycle bin with the bottle, and the rest is dumped down the drain.",1
1,"This item was purchased in silver, not in the teal color.<br /><br />Nightmare customer service from Mardisplay. I returned my item, but it took eight emails and over five weeks to get my refund. Thank goodness I had gotten delivery tracking on my return! Often my emails were simply ignored. Several times I was promised my refund would be issued \\""tomorrow\\"", but it didn't happen. Stay away from this seller.<br /><br />On the other hand, the box is pretty, with drawers juuuust a little too short to hold any nail polish bottles that stand upright. There are tall \\""legs\\"" that take up a considerable amount of the box's height. Still, this item is DEFINITELY not worth trying to work with an unresponsive and untrustworthy seller.",1

1,"Horrible product, bought it in mid February and it died mid may. Bought primarily for shaving my head which it did fine the first time, but then died before it could finish the job a 2nd time even though it was fully charged, and had been very well taking care of for that short time period! Worst money I have spent in a long time, please do yourself a favor and get something that is going to last.",1
2,"It might be a matter of hair type, but this did not work for my hair.  The results were zero. I discarded it.",1
1,"I purchased the 1050 to replace my old Phillips Quadra 6865 which needed new heads and rechargeable batteries. I am really disappointed with the results from this shaver. As other reviewers point out, this razor is very harsh on my skin and in fact the third time I used it it gave me a bad case of razor burn in my adams apple area that resulted in scarring (since healed). I now am very careful when I use it and this results in it taking longer to shave than my old razor. It can give me a smooth shave but it requires care and patience. I feel that the 1050 is a step backwards for Phillips. In the end I replaced the batteries and heads on my old Quadra and use it more than the 1050. I would recommend that if you are buying this shaver, make sure you can return it if you need to. One final thing. Several reviews here complain about the shaver head catching their hair when using the trimmer on sideburns. The manual tells you to remove the shaving head when using the trimmer.",1
2,"I bought this device from the company itself and used it faithfully for about two weeks.  Number one, it is difficult to use.  Number two, even though I was smelling burnt hair, I didn't see any hair removal.  And I would go over the same area several times.  I did this every day for the two weeks before I finally gave up.  I had no trouble returning it, though.  The customer service rep was very nice, even though she tried to get me to keep it longer and keep trying.  I said no and she gave me a RMA#.  I got my money back in a short amount of time.  My niece bought the newer Pro model and it seems to be working for her, so maybe it really depends on your hair type.  However, it's too expensive to get and find out it doesn't work.  I would save my money and just use a razor.",1
2,"My waterpik worked great for the first few months of use. Shortly after about 3 months, the button that pauses water flow started sticking. Now, after almost one year, it is leaking from the button that ejects the attachment. The leak is so severe that there is no water pressure coming from the attachment itself. There is no way to fix the problem which makes it completely useless now. I am very disappointed that this happened. I thought waterpik was a good brand. I will be buying from a different company next time.",1

2,"I bought this because my older Conair caught on fire one morning, after about 6 years of use. I needed something quick and inexpensive. That is what this is. The diffuser is not well conceived, the directional is poorly done. The airflow is slow, and the dryer doesn't seem to get hot enough.

And then no change in skin. I tried to call customer service but got put on hold several times until I just gave up.

2,"O.K warm colors but the bright colors are HORRIBLE. I ordered this palette for the nice different colors that are on it and it came really soon (I believed it came 1 day before it was supposed to arrived) I got the palette for Halloween since I'm really good with stage make-up so I thought that this was going to be great for my 5 costumes this year 2012, But the bright colors DO NOT SHOW ON SKIN no matter how much you put on (I'm Hispanic male Tan 4 X's a week) so I have great complexion for the colors to pop but did not, not even on my little siblings when I was doing their Halloween make-up. I threw the bottom palette but kept the top with the warm colors [ex: brown,black,nude,white. etc] I kept the top palette because I use the soft browns for shading in my eyebrows and works wonderfully and lasts all day. I only use for eyebrows because it does not work for me as eye-shadows AT ALL. Came wrapped perfectly and without any crushed colors  (I'll stick to buying my eye-shadows at Sephora&Mac)",1

1,"This was recommended by my dental hygienist for my deteriorating gum condition, and for a great many months I soldiered on with it even though it burned my mouth and was on the whole unpleasant. The manufacturer's customer support advised me to stop it if it was burning me, and my own research persuaded me that any mouthwash with alcohol was subjecting me to a danger of mouth cancer. So I stopped it, and amazingly my gums improved *after* I stopped, when they had deteriorated while I was taking the mouthwash. I'm not suggesting that the Listerine made my condition worse, but it clearly didn't help. My dental hygienist is pleased with my improvement and is no longer urging me to use mouthwash.",1

I will say this massage roller was poorly made or not well thought. When I attempt to use this product it scratches into my skin not leaving a wound but just enough to be really painful. It's also very loud when in use. It's somewhat embarrassing if you were using it in public or amongst others. I just wish I never purchased it,",1
1,"I would not waste your money on this product.  The entire idea of it is that it's supposed to last longer than normal nail polish, and it chipped the next morning after I did it, and then kept chipping as 2 days went by -- a total pain in the butt.  It's also hard to apply neatly because of the process of painting color over wet gel.  So even if it didn't constantly chip - you have messy-looking nails.  So what's the benefit?  Also, you have to purchase special remover to get it off of your nails.  I bought 100% acetone to get it off.  REgular nail polish with a regular topcoat works and looks so much better!

1,"I had previously ordered the Mirenesse mascara and loved it, however this product didn't seem the same.  The mascara itself was very &#34;clumpy&#34;, and the wand was bulky, not like the one I had previously ordered.  I did not like these products!",1
2,"A friend said it worked for her and she has lost fat around her stomach using it.  I thought this \\""to go\\"" pack was very convenient as I can take it anywhere.  It tastes pretty good too.  I found that I forget to take it before every meal, but, when I did take it, I did not notice any difference.  I knew it was too good to be true.",1
2,Not bad,1
2,"I don't believe this product came anywhere close to fulfilling all the claims it made.  I have found that, of all the tanning product companies that I have tried, Devoted Creations is the most reliable, honest product.  I don't love everything that DC makes, but I feel the high quality is uniform across all of their products.",1
2,"This is VERY small, and could only hold half the perfume from its original bottle. It doesn't spray particularly well, either. It is pretty, but that's about it.",1
2,"Did not work right out of the box. Just got it today and plugged it in...nothing...no LED light up...no motor movement. It's broken! Going back to Amazon! Thank God for free return shipping! I did give it two stars only because I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt and I'm thinking I just got a \\""lemon\\"".",1
2,"I bought this product directly from my stylist. It worked wonderfully to smooth my edges. But beware!!! After continued usage, it turned my hair into straw! The hair on my edges and nape are now completely unmanageable. A touch-up won't tame it. I need to SHAVE my hair for new growth. I strongly recommend using an oil-based hair gel.",1
2,"I hated giving this two stars because I am a big fan of Burt's Bees and any all-natural product, but it was totally ineffective with some bug bites I got (from the hospital, yikes!) It has been days and I am still itching like crazy. To be fair, OTC hydrocortisone has not helped with previous bites either; sigh....",1
1,"I purchased this product on November 1st, used it a few times then suddenly on November 25th... the middle button stopped working. Perhaps mine was poorly manufactured... I don't know. For some strange reason they don't accept replacements either... I am waiting to process my refund.<br /><br />Update: Replaced the battery as this Amy person suggested... useless... still broke. I have since gotten rid of mine because they will not accept returns and will not refund you, had to throw it away... what a waste of money! DO NOT BUY!",1
1,You have to hold down the button to keep the light on.  Not easy when you need 2 hands to tweeze.....great trying to remove a splinter - or a stray brow hair....NOT,1
2,"I thought I'd save a few bucks and buy these since I didn't think it was possible to mess up such a simple product design. I thought wrong. The ones I received were extremely dull, making them pointless to use. Rather cheap plastic molded handle as well. Some of the edges on the handle were sharper because of the burred edges from the mold job.<br />My advice: spend the money for the name-brand versions in the beauty section of your local stores. It'll be worth it.",1
2,"I had high expectations for this product based on all the great reviews. After using this product for a month I can't understand how these reviews came about.<br /><br />Firstly, I am disappointed at the build quality of this product. The silver paintwork is already peeling off. I thought considering the cost of this product that it was made of metal. The silver panels along the side are silver painted plastic.<br /><br />Apart from the build quality, shaving takes a long time to complete as you need to pass the shaver head 10-20 times over your face. The worst part of the shave being around the neck.<br /><br />The \\""Powercomb\\"" technology does absolutely nothing.<br /><br />The cost of this product does not equate to quality and I could have gotten the same shave experience with a much cheaper product.",1
1.0,Awful..I threw it away.,1
1,"I bought this item since December 14, 2013 and now i got it 4 months after and this is after the second time of sending it cause the fist one did not come.After taking long to come,one of the bottles were empty,imagine that,you all need to do better.One more thing, you all need to do something about the people you send these item with,cause i was not getting any information from the tracking number i got.Need to do better,need to do better,need to do better.",1

1,"Both the blue and the green medium boar bristle brushes cracked within 20 seconds after initially runnning them under warm water and soap.  This is totally unacceptable. Now previously, I bought the red soft brush and have had it for 6 months with no problems, regularly running it under warm water and soap to clean it.  I have never had this problem with a Diane brush and I don't know if I can ever purchase from Crown Quality Products again as that $40 plus dollars seemed to have been a waste.  The quality of the wood should not be that fragile and so I question the &#34;quality&#34; of the company in their choice of wood.",1
2,"As soon as I heard about this new product I was so excited to try it. I purchased this in three different colors 310, 315 and 320 because I have such a hard time matching my skin tone, It turns out 315 was my perfect match.... I loved the fact that this make up comes in many different shades. I also love the fact it has a lot of yellow tones in my opinion... Most make up from drugstores have more red tones and don't look good on my skin but THIS particular product has yellowish tones... and I was happy about that... The main thing that I didn't like was the coverage... It provides light to medium coverage and I have a lot of acne spots and bumps and this product did not cover anything. If I ever get my skin clear with less spots I would definitely wear this make up. It's so light and natural perfect for like younger women that have really good skin but.. if you're like me and need tons of coverage would not recommend this product...",1
1,it's not works at all. I been using it for 3 month already I don't seen any results like these comments discribed don't waiste your money!,1
1,"It is totally not worth the money.  It is a good idea, but poorly designed.  The adhesive base is flat and does not conform to breast.  The outer edge will stick out and very unnaturally looking.  I may as well just use duct tape and cotton ball......LOL",1
1.0,"I received my first \\""Walklite Walker 6300\\"" in April 2012. It was purchased through Medicare.  I  called the Company that my physical therapist used. The name on the label.As of the middle of September 2012 my rear plastic walker footing / rear breaking system wore out to the rear two metal legs until the rear legs were slowly wearing away.<br /> Unfortunately I cannot receive another walker for another 4 1/2 years through Medicare.<br /> called the Company that my P.T.used.  They informed me of the above information. However they would \\""repair\\"" my rear legs  for a total of 209.96.  I have the breakdown but it's too long to go into.<br />  I looked at another company online, unfortunately it was not Amazon.  I paid a total of $167.46 for another walker exactly the same.  Amazon's price was a lot less.<br />  Unfortunately there are predatory companies out there looking to prey on seniors.<br />  This was a lesson I learned.<br /><br />  GO TO AMAZON FIRST TO RECEIVE THE BEST PRICE.<br /><br />  WaltCT",1
1,The item received is not as the item pictured it is GH5050. There is no where to lay the hot curling irons. It is too large for a small bathroom. The GH5250V1 is the correct size and is what I needed for my use.,1
1.0,This product felt oily on my skin and caused more breakouts and redness than I had before using it.,1
2,"I thought this would be more convenient than my older model that plugs in to the wall and has a rectangular reservoir for water.  I was wrong.  This thing runs out of water before I'm halfway done, and you have to hold it vertically or it stops pumping.  The tube from my countertop model is a minor inconvenience compared to having to tilt my head around to accommodate this dumb vertical thing.  Also, this has two power settings, Low or High, where the other one is continuously adjustable over a wider range of pressures.  On the plus side, it basically does the job, just not as conveniently as my older one.",1
1,"There was hardly any primer in the applicator.  I contacted the seller, who immediately refunded my money minus $2.  I'm very satisfied with the seller, not the product.",1
2,"Considering how messy and time consuming it is to do properly color your hair with henna, I found the results disappointing. If your hair is darker (mine's dark brown), this does nothing to cover your grays. It might work for somebody with auburn or dark red hair. Regardless, whatever results you do manage to get with this product last less than two weeks. I used a sulfate free shampoo every other day and still, the color was gone after about ten days. Total waste of time and money.   Speaking of money, if you still are curious about experimenting with this product, it's probably cheaper at your local Indian grocery store: $1.99 as opposed to $5.99. Lame, Amazon. Real lame.",1
1,"I love this scent an1d the product arrived in perfect condition. HOWEVER, paid waay too much. Should have had more patience and let it come back into season!",1
1,"Terrible! For being so cheap I guess you get what you pay for, but my power box wouldnt even power on the tattoo gun. No directions on how to put together. One would assume this being a beginners kit you would get instructions. Had to go out an buy another power source.",1
1,overall the product is fine so far but the cartridge went bust within the first 5 flashes. The machine was making sound and beeping when put on skin but no flash. I changed the cartridge and it started working again. Also i read it in so many places that the cartridge they supply with the machine is mostly faulty. The replacement ones are fine.,1
1.0,I have been looking for a product to stain my lips and not dry them out. I found that this stain did not stay on very long at all. I also purchased the gloss and the same thing happened. The color was bright and didn't chap my lips like some stains do. It only stayed on my lips for about 3 hours then faded away.,1
1,"have used this product for years and not sure if it was a bad batch or avalon is using a new formula but it had a very bad odor and barely smelled like lavender.  I used to love that this was the one lotion I could buy that smelled like a pure lavender squeezed flower, but this particular batch did not unfortunately.  Went in the garbage because the smell was not pleasant.",1
1,I thought the sizes of the products were larger. What a RIP OFF!! NEVER AGAIN! My fault: I was so dissappointed!!,1
1,Doesn't work. Not enough suction or bad design.,1
2,"Not impressed. The grit is a weird chunky and isn't like sand paper. I won't buy, these again. I'd rather spend more and have what I need.",1
1,"I bought this product not on Amazon but should have read the reviews first. I only used it for 2 days and almost didn't wake up on 1-20-14. I am very lucky that I did. I was gagging, my tongue was swelling and my throat was swollen out past my chin! I took a Benadryl and went to the ER. I am on Benadryl, Prednisone and have to carry an Epipen all from this mouthwash! I have seen my Allergist Doctor and tomorrow I see a Ear, Nose, Throat Doctor as I am still having issues. I have been a Crest user since I was a kid and this is the first time I tried the mouthwash and it TRIED TO KILL ME! Don't use this product. I have seen over 500 consumer complaints on the internet about this very thing since then. It is not just me that this is happening to. My bills are skyrocketing from this product.<br /><br />Update as of Jan 23rd. Saw a ENT Doctor today and I still have residual allergic reaction swelling.  More predinsone and benedryl with a recheck next week. I haven't used this mouthwash since Sunday night and it's still causing issues! My doctor and I are reporting it to the FDA. If you have a reaction to this product please also report it to the FDA to get it off the shelves!<br /><br />Update as of Feb 10th. Still have jaw and tongue swelling and more medical bills. I just reported it to the Better Business Buerau.<br /><br />***This product won't get off the shelves unless your report it to the FDA and the BBB online. It is very easy to do both. Just doing a review like this won't get it off the market. Please do the reports****",1
1,It burned my face.I would not buy it again,1
1.0,I can't believe I was so excited to receive this and followed exact directions Drybrush upside down. And this is what it looks like after the first time I use it.  Very scared because I ordered two other brushes from this company that are on their way. I will update this review in a week. The seller is trying to rectify this with me and talk to the dealer:) hoping this was just a bad brush,1
1,sprayer was broken when I got this and it's sealed shut so I couldn't even remove the contents of the bottle and put into a spray bottle.,1
1,The product itself is very good but The vendor cheated me with this product. Their offer made you belive you were purchasing the 16 onz size instead they send me the 5 onz (with a price appropriate for the bigger size). I felt cheated out of my money and when I complain the said that they never offer the size I though I've purchased. I know the salon price of the product and I ended up paying way more with this vendor.,1
2,don't waste the money. used the whole thing and saw no results!,1
2,My nails are not very shiny after putting on polish and top coat. Has anyone experienced this?  Any suggestions? Also put on 1 or 2 coats of polish?,1
2,"I absolutely LOVE the product itself - after trying every single dry shampoo on the market, I still haven't found a good replacement! It comes out perfectly foamy, yet it's not hard to brush it into my hair.    HOWEVER - It seems as if it evaporates after only a couple uses! I know no one else is using it, but the product always seems to dry up or something after only 2 weeks... That makes it waaaaay to expensive of a product if it just keeps evaporating!    I would love it if TIGI could just fix the product packaging so that people like me would actually get our money's worth of product :(",1
1.0,"As an African American woman finding the right foundation or concealer is extremely difficult. Posner cover cream in shades light-medium and medium use to be the perfect match for my complexion. I would use light-medium in the winter and medium during the summer months. However, the last few times I have order this product it seems that these two shades have changed drastically as both are now way lighter than my skin tone (even the medium). It's unfortunate that whom ever is making Posner cover cream now has totally gotten it wrong. I will no longer order this product not even in a darker shade.",1
2,"didn't work for us like we assumed by reading about it, would not recommend or purchase again",1
2,"Blowout sale my foot!  I would not pay a penny more than the $10.75 that I paid for this. I have purchased about 20 different sleep masks over the last few years. This one is of no better quality, nor  does it work any better than the other masks in the same price range. I really expected something special. Oh well",1
1,"It worked ok, I just say get the real deal it try Target and Sallys for an alternanive that's almost as good as the real beauty blender sold in Sephora",1
2.0,"The combs don't last long; the first broke in my back pocket after about two weeks. They start breaking at the very end and works down. The comb feels very hard on my hair, because it feels as though it is being stripped and i don't have coarse hair. At the time my hair was maybe 4 inches long. I have tried other combs that have the same teeth spacing and are much better. Don't buy this.",1
1,It doesn't smell like Christian Dior. I still have some left in the bottle I got from the store and they look and smell completely different. This one was yellow in color. Disappointed.,1
1,"This product didn't do anything out of the ordinary drug store product, costing much less.",1
1,"On December 13, 2014 I purchased this product on Amazon because the photos featured pictures of the attractive box it came in, as you would buy off the shelf in a cosmetic store. So, I naively assumed it would be BRAND NEW IN BOX. What I received was a LOOSE TUBE of lotion rolling around, one that could very well be used for all I know. NO BOX!!! This was not as advertised and I am extremely disappointed!",1
1,"Why did I even give this a try in the first place, the MT brand is so much better. This one just leaves scratch marks all over my skin, the needles are so close together that they do not even penetrate my skin, they just scratch it. Worst dermaroller I have ever used.",1
2,"This *seemed* like a great idea when we first bought it, and even tried a sample of it, but within a week the smell of it really got on my nerves and we had to give the rest of it away! Sort of a sickly sweet smell, hard to describe . . . we had to give the rest of it away :-(",1
2,"I'm usually not a very picky person but I'm quite disappointed with this product. Yes, it goes on the nail nicely and dries quickly but I had this top coat peel right off the same day I put it on! Unless your a doll who sits all day, this is not for you. I would much rather recommend the Sally Hansen Insta-dri polish. Its cheaper and works better!",1
1,I tried this eyeliner after Sephora quit carrying my usual Anna Sui liquid eyeliner (001 black). The black eyeliner is too light and unlike most liquid eyeliners it smudges really easy. If you are looking for a dark black eyeliner with staying power try Anna Sui.,1
1,do not use any heat on these at all. used my flat iron one time on the lowest heat setting just to make them blend with my own hair better. the ends began to frizz and get supper tangled. half my head was straight smooth and beautiful the bottom half was bushy. if u r someone who is just gonna let them be as is and not style them great item for you but if u wanna style them and do different things dont they are CHEAP,1
1.0,Sent it back - outrageously expensive,1
2,"The last one of these I had, (another brand) had rounded tips on all the little knobs. These are flat on the bottom of each one, which makes them sharp on the edge of each one, and it feels like I am scraping my scalp off. I have used it several times, thinking I will eventually get use to it. So far, that hasn't happened.",1
1,"This pillow has no support at all and doesn't make any sense to me at all.  I bought it because I wanted to have something handy rather than rolling up a towel for support every time as recommended by my doctor, but this just collapses.  I suppose it's better than nothing at all, but I feel like a fool for spending my money on this.  Mine was also folded in half in the box.",1
1.0,I  have used Bare Escentuals and this blush for six years and always purchased from a store.  The consistency of the powder was such that it will not spread on my face.  It seems hard and in little balls instead of powder.  I am very disappointed given what it cost.,1
1,I wish I could give it 0 star. I don't know why anybody would do this to him/herself! I rolled this on my face very gently but it really hurts! The density of the needles is not high enough for me to tolerate the pain! It's like a mini meat tenderizer.,1
1,The brushes are low quality and not worth your money.,1
1,"It's the worst toner that I had!<br />Pros-nothing;cons-it leaves your skin sticky,greasy,clog pores and you will feel it until your next face wash.",1
1,"I was excited to try this but found that it doesn't work. At all. It may have pulled out the odd hair or two, but in NO WAY did do what it claimed to do.",1
1,Smells horrible .. I threw it away 😡😡😡😡,1
1,"I used this product faithful twice a day as instructed.  My teeth did not change, there was no difference with my shade from the first day I used the product to the last day.  The ten shades lighter claim is absolutely false.  Very disappointed in wasting my money.",1
1,"I had bought this product as i heard so much about it, and also because of the description . It actually don't do Anything for me it almost month and nothing change so dont waste your money",1
1,"I have been an avid Crest user for most of my life, for no particular reason except for the fact that Crest was what we had in the house. I went to the dentist about a month ago and they recommended Crest Total because it contains Triclosan which helps with gum health. I went right to the store and started using it, after 2 days I had 5 canker sores! My fiance also used it and the same thing happened to him, multiple canker sores within a couple days of use. I stopped using Colgate and switched back to Crest. The canker sores went away almost immediately with no other treatment.   I now know why that is what we always had in my house! I did some research and it turns out that one of the ingredients in Colgate Total is Sodium Lauryl Sulfate which has been shown to cause canker sores. So if you are having trouble with canker sores look at the ingredient label of your standard toothpaste and if it contains SLS, switch for a few days and see what happens!  Learned my lesson and will never buy Colgate again!!",1
2,"This doesnt really work if you sit down ever, the stethoscope will be in a very awkward position or pop out, also hard to get to stay on pants. It was cheap but not worth it.",1
1,Worst lipstick ever.,1
2,"I thought I was sending my bf a 2 pack of &#34;Clix&#34; by Axe, instead he got something called &#34;Click&#34;. I'm so confused, the product and picture clearly state this is &#34;Clix&#34;. I'm so embarrassed as it was sent as a gift.",1
2.0,I could never get a suction on it. It bruised my lip and I had a bruise mustache :(,1
1,If you guys are really thinking that your buying authentic mac brushes you are wrong... they are definitely fake... mac brushes are very expensive and if they came in a set they would be even more expensive... these are no anywhere close to the quality of mac brushes... sorry,1
2,Definitely not the scent for me.,1
1.0,"To begin with I've used WaterPik Plus for years now and the only complaint I had there was that the Batteries failed after about a year or so. I thought I'd try this unit to see if it fared any better. No joy there, it failed after about a month. I have extensive bridgework, so I look to the unit to replace the awkward floss threaders the dentist gives you. My critique will be a comparison between the ToiletTree unit and the comparably priced WaterPik Plus. (I'll assume that the quick failure was a luck of the draw MTBF glitch and go on its functional merits)<br /><br />Pro:<br />-Gets the job done (though I think the WaterPik does it better).<br />-Smaller footprint than the WaterPik if your shelf is crowded.<br />-Charge light is bright enough for a Nite light.<br />Cons:<br />-Reservoir fills from the top and is too tall to fit under many Bathroom taps, so you need to keep a fill cup handy.<br />-Fill hole is small and unvented so you have to pour slow and steady (just a minor pain I guess).<br />-Looses power quickly after charging , I had to charge about every 3 days to keep it working to my satisfaction.<br />-Power button is stiff and not very prominent. Hard to find and click off while using the unit.<br /><br />All in all, I found the user experience of the device subpar and probably would have replaced it with another WaterPik even if it hadn't failed. Sorry ToiletTree (Seriously, who picked that name? The visual I get from it not very flattering).",1

1,"\\""This shaver was high priced, yet LCD display stopped working after after 8 mos so I couldn't tell when I was getting low and resulted in poorer shaves. Blades dulled after 1 year when these were supposed to not need replacement for 2 years and I have skimpy, light beard growth.\\""",1
2,The smell is the same as a shampoo I once used on my dog and it does nothing for my hair other than make me smell like a forest all day.,1

2,"I bought this for my girlfriend.  It has very clear optics on the regular and magnified sides.  The light is not really very powerful, but OK.  The main problem is that after it was plugged in for a week it just started turning on and off by itself.  Had to unplug it, what good is that?",1
2.0,"Just received this product. I'm an esthetician & was going to give this a try in the facial room (for some clients w/ super dry skin). The size of the jar is ridiculously SMALL! I certainly won't be able to try on more than 3 clients. Guess I should have paid more attention to ounces. But this doesn't even seem like 1.3oz. The container is thick & actual product is not much bigger than a sample size. At this price this for this amount, this better be like a masque of gold. Think twice before ordering. Will make another comment after use but size of container &#34;massively disappointing&#34;.",1
1,Product doesnt stay on all day. It smudges and is clumpy when applied. Didnt irritate my eyes though. Isnt water resistant,1
2.0,It says blonde but it's very dark,1
2,"Save your dollars and buy an oscillating brush- because this spins in one direction is pulls your skin a bit and is pretty messy (flings soap everywhere).  Also I'm not sure if it's defective, but the button is really hard to press.",1

2,"I just started using this product and I have to say so far so good.I am happy with the quality of this product and it seems to be doing what it's supposed to.I will update this review as I near the end of the tube and I am confident I will still be liking if not loving this product.Very happy I got it and I look forward to great results!!! I have changed my rating due to lack of ability to contact the seller directly.I used the product and after the first use I was happy with it(I use various vitamin C products and this seemed to be a good one)Unfortunately the dispenser broke and I tries several times to either get a replacement or just a pumper and this issue could not be addressed,my only option is to send it back for a refund not a replacement.A simple pump would have made me happy.Any contact with the seller would have made me happy.I will use the product without the dispenser and I am not at all happy about that and will not buy it again knowing these types of issues cannot be resolved.I love A,azon and this is no fault of theirs,they did everything they could.",1
2,"Perhaps this was just a bad batch but none of the three that came in the package have stayed on the brush for long. To the vendor's credit they did contact me soon after the order was received asking to be allowed to fix any concerns. I shared with them that the first brush had failed but that the second seemed to be working. I have searched my email but there does not appear to be a reply from them regarding the faulty first brush. In fairness, they probably receive hundreds if not thousands of emails. In any case, while the second brush did last a couple weeks or so, it too, failed, as did the third one, almost immediately. None of these brushes would stay on the handle. Again, it is probably just a bad batch but I will probably try to find another vendor for the next order. I should say the brushes themselves were fine, otherwise. If they had stayed on I would have given them a 4 or 5.",1
2,"I was under the impression that this was sunblock. It's not. It just \\"" protects your tattoo\\"". Don't waste your money. Buy a good sunblock, it's cheaper than this.",1
1.0,I don't like the smell. For me it's too sweet. It  makes my hair heavy and limp.,1
2,Broke the first day my girlfriend wore it.,1
1,"I have four problems with this product.<br /><br />A) Product quality:<br />My previous handle came apart after 24 shaves.<br /><br />B) Usability:<br />The handles are entirely different shape and contour between models.<br />Many do not come with a tray to hold extra blades.<br />Many do not fit in existing trays to hold extra blades.<br /><br />C) Customer Service:<br />I reported the problem to Shick, which is \\""Energizer Personal Care\\"".<br />2 weeks later, they responded with apology, and committment to send me a coupon to replace the handle.<br />5 weeks after that email, I received the coupon in the mail.<br /><br />D) The blades clog.  If I have stubble only, then the shaving goo and stubble bits pack into the razor.  It can't be rinsed out except maybe by a pressure-washer.  If I have a couple of week's worth of growth, the hairs all get stuck in the safety wires they put over the blades to keep them from cutting you.<br /><br />Overall, this product shows a lack of usability study, poor customer service, etc.<br /><br />Go back to Gillette.  They are worth the 15% more cost for the 3000% better product.",1
2,"I like Neutrogena, have been using their products my whole life. I use the grapefruit face wash , so it seemed a no - brainer to use the wipes.<br />When I opened the package I had second thoughts. The fragrance is VERY INTENSE. Also unpleasant. Only vaguely like grapefruit, with a very musty and acrid component. Hard to describe. Scent is a very subjective thing, but hard to believe anyone would find this appealing.<br />Still I used several times. The wipes are large and very soft, and remove even stubborn makeup. Not drying at all. I'd love them if they smelled good<br />, but not only do I dislike the smell it really lingers.",1
1,the pump stopped working quickly and I junked it. This goes through soap way too fast. I was using a bottle a week with this as I can't wash in the 2.5 seconds of soapy spray you get. It took me four long pumps. Nice idea though. And the chrome is not worth the extra cost. Just get the white. The chrome is still plastic made to look like chrome. Cheap looking. I thought it would match my fixtures.,1

1,"Minus that star! This vendor told me it was shipped, I never rec'd it. And surprise they have no more. When I tried to contact them thru Amazon the site it was unavailable. The fact that they didn't research it or care or try to do something to get me another is what bothered me. They couldn't be bothered by my small purchase.",1
1,"I'm amazed at how many people really dont read the labels and could care less about what they are putting on their skin. I guess as long as the price is right and the packaging and scent look good, it really doesn't matter. Almost all of the Canus products contain toxic chemicals, but you are led to believe they are \\""natural\\"" and gentle on your skin. I would much rather wear a goats milk lotion, or ANY type of lotion for that matter that has none of these toxic chemicals or preservatives added. They use them because they are cheap to manufacture, not because they actually CARE about what it does for you. I prefer the natural bath. [...]",1

1,Don't ever buy this curling iron!! Comes from factory with wear and isn't even close to being 2&#34;. Save money don't waste it on this scam.,1
2,I received brushes that were bent at the metal section. The bristles were uneven and jagged. It also took a really long time for it to ship,1
2,"Don't really think much of this product.  Was looking for something a little cheaper than my current product (philosophy).  Guess you get what you pay for.  I am 43 and don't have too many lines, but this really does nothing other than hydrate for a few short hours.  Not horrible, but not really worth it.",1
2,I have purchased 3 brushes in the last 30 days.  The first one did not work?  The second worked  for 2 days and it quite too?  The third lasted for 5 days and it stopped.  The people that sell these brushes to the public should be ashamed of themselves.  My dentist stopped selling the rotadent products a long time ago because of complaints from his patients.  Poor quality products.,1
1,"I ordered it and received another product. I sent them a message and instead of shipping the right product, they asked me to purchase the shaving foam again and keep the wrong product,cause that wouldn't be fair Sending me what I ordered with no extra cost, so I should return their wrong product. I bought that as a gift,i thought it wouldn't be nice of me asking the person to return it. I have to pay for that again,if I want what i ordered and paid for. Terrible costumer service.",1
1,Ughhhhhhhhh ok I ordered mine in JANUARY!!! AHH I still haven't got both items I ordered from here. I ordered<br />Extentions and bangs (separately) and I haven't got either 😡. Iv emailed them several times and no reply. So if you don't want your items to get lost I suggest NOT to order from them. I want a refund really bad but I used a gift card😡😡😡. It makes me sad cause I most exited to get these. Big mistake,1
1,I don't no why I even bothered with this rite after u put it on it tangles. Rite up its annoying and I already have to cut it,1
1,"I used this on several different settings over several sessions, starting at the lowest and working my way up to about medium-high. The lower settings appeared to work at first, but the hair grew right back - and no, not hair in the same area that just hadn't grown in at the time of treatment. Hair from the same follicles I treated. I could tell because I had red spots in every treatment location for weeks afterward. I tried higher settings twice, and have experienced no regrowth in those locations. However, I am still scarred five months later from those treatments. I'm done with this.",1
1,It's very heavy in my hair and honestly didn't notice a difference.. Save your money and buy something cheaper and if you have thin hair it is to heavy of a product for that hair type,1
1,"The items description says things like \\""Made by hand\\"" and \\""Polished to perfection\\"".  LIES!  This bun cover is made of cheap, tacky, bendable plastic and could be bought in any local store for under $2.00",1

1,"I bought the Prevage trial kit with four small pump bottles.  I really, really, REALLY wanted this product to work.  After reading about the rash outbreaks experienced by many, I tried this product using a VERY small amount applied only to my deepest facial creases.  It was all fine for about 2 weeks (long after the period suggested when doing a patch test).  After that time, I developed a horrible rash on my foot.  It spread to my lower leg, then I got patches of it on my thigh.  The next rashy area developed on my hands, then I had some patches on my face.  The itching is absolutely intense, with small blisters and \\""weeping\\"".  Cortisone ointment helped me stop the itch long enough so I wouldn't scratch in my sleep.  Having it on the foot is agony because the rubbing created by walking causes the rash to itch madly and simultaneously supply a simulated scratching.  This creates a viscious cycle of itching, scratching, further irritation and outbreak, etc.  I am surprised this product managed to find its way on the market when there are so many people adversely affected by it.  It is a highly-priced form of torture.  You may be one of the lucky people not experiencing a reaction, but you may also be one of those whose reaction is delayed.  Are you willing to take the risk?  I have to say it's not worth it.",1

I lit the candle while taking a tub bath, no aroma.  I had it by the tub at my head and still no fragrance.  This was a complete waste of money.  The only thing that I experienced was a crackling sound when lit and the packaging was as described but there is no fragrance.  I was thinking of contacting you because I thought perhaps this particular item was outdated.  I would definitely not buy this again",1
1,Never received the product so I can't give you a review about their product but I have used formula 10 before and been very satisfied with just can't find it in stores any more.  but the seller refunded my money no problems so I nothing bad to say.,1
1,Really hate it. It just makes my skin sticky and greasy looking...very uncomfortable after applying it...,1
1,This lotion is really a strange product. It says it is for REALLY sensitive skin and that it is ultra hypoallergenic. On the contrary - it made my daughter break out and have weird blotches all over her beautiful face when she has never had that reaction before to any other lotion! I would not recommend this as it obviously has some strangeness about it. I have loved and never had any problems with little remedies intense moisturizer and will be going back to that product. I would never have bought this Exederm stuff except that I was on vacation and had run out of little remedies. Exederm gets a thumbs down.,1

2,It does not seem to protect my hair from breakage due as I'd hoped.  I use a flat iron regularly and was looking for a product to help keep my hair as healthy as it could be.  This product did add shine and has a plesant aroma.,1
1,"Yes I should have sued them but I waited to long hoping my hair would grow back, this is crap it changed the texture of my hair when it finally did grow back to fine and brittle plus my hair never fully grew back.

1,They're too thin to have any magnetic pull to any surface.  Your best bet is to go to a craft store in your area and get some there instead.,1
1,Product discretion is misleading. It is twilight themed and has twilight written on it at least 3 times. It's VERY thin and cheap feeling. Mad and disappointed I was tricked.,1
2,It doesn't keep the clippers cool.  Doesn't cool them down once they are hot.,1
1,Beware this product is fake as the seal came off when i opened the lid.,1
1,"Being in the &#34;It Works&#34; business as a distributor, personally I would not recommend buying this product. Not just from here, but from any online vendor. When I bought this I wasn't in the business, and I personally liked the cheap price of it without having to sign up for anything like the company makes you. But you get what you pay for. Now i know that the quality is way worse than the ones directly from the company. When bought, I followed all steps, drank eight gallons of water, but still no effect. I used as directed, but the problem wasn't me, but the packaging! From this seller, they were pretty dry, and that's why the botanical's didn't infuse properly. I recommend just paying the $100 buying from a seller.<br />Also if you're looking for other weight loss solutions, I would recommend you follow @endless creations (WITH A K instead of C) @voluptuous chicks, and @couture bod (NO SPACES) on inst a gram. They will get you hooked up.<br />I'm not saying its the company's fault it didn't work, but the online vendor's.",1

2,"I have had three Remington shavers and they perform great, but poor battery life is the achilles heel of the product.  With daily shaving, expect your battery to last about 18 months.  After that, it's time to either ship it to an 'authorized repair site' and incur a big fee or plunk down more cash for a new one.  <br />By the way, the battery bypass cord is useless if the battery dies.  It can't bypass without some sustainable life in the battery so the shaver is dead when the battery goes.  Not exactly what I'd call consumer friendly engineering.",1

1,"With all the hoopla about this &#34;new&#34; oil I was anxious to try it.  Of all the promises of improvement, the only thing I found to be true is that it didn't break my skin out.  I saw no benefits whatsoever.  The oil is thicker than I assumed (it did not soak in even after 1-1/2 hours;  had to blot with a tissue before applying makeup).  One  odd thing to note is that is mixes with water, which I did to thin it out.  Won't be ordering this again.",1
1,"I originally purchased this exact bottle of body wash from my local vitamin store & fell in love with it. It helped with my acne (face & back) and I really enjoyed the smell. I decided to buy it on Amazon since it was about $4 cheaper per bottle. I see why now... Although its the same brand and label, the bottle I purchased from here does not have any (I mean ZERO) exfoliating beads. The previous bottle I had was packed with them and I think it's what works to help get the dirt and make up out of your pores. I am very disappointed & will not buy this item from Amazon again.",1
2.0,"Product didn't live up to the hype for me.  It is \\""lite\\"" but it leaves hair crunchy.  My hair type is 3A/3B and I didn't feel like my curls were well nourished.  I even tried it on my son's short curls and the hold only lasted a few hours then it began to look dry.",1

1,I am in my mid 30's I have fine lines on my cheeks and around my mouth. For me this product did nothing. I saw no improvement. It actually made my lines look worse because it dried my skin out. I felt no tingeling or tightning of my skin. So for me it did not work.,1

2.0,Seller sent me opened boxes & unsealed tubes of a vaginal product. I have ordered this same product from another seller in India and they were sealed boxes & tubes. I ordered it for a health problem and don't need to make it worse. The product didn't look or smell like what I already had from another seller. After paying $10.00 to ship {which I did not mind} two small tubes of this product they expected me to also pay shipping back to them for the return. Would you use this product? I think not. I order alot from Amazon and am saddened they did nothing. I hate to give anyone bad feedback but this seller didn't understand what was wrong?? They did provide very fast shipping.,1

1,Says it is a dry oil and penetrates the skin.  It feels very thick and oily on the skin.  I am sure the spf 50+ works though.,1
1,Be forewarned that the dye for these scrunchies is not colorfast. I had it in my hair and the dye transferred to my beige leather couch. I can not get the stains out of my $1500 couch. The dye has also gotten onto my pillow cases and sheets from sleeping with it. Do not use my most costly purchase here on Amazon. Wish I had never brought.,1

2,"I got all the facial products from this Grandma Agafia product line, including this one. While I love all the rest, this one is greasier than I would expect from a day cream, takes a while to get absorbed in the skin (and does not get absorbed well, overall), does not seem to provide enough moisture; lastly, it does break me out - not terribly but enough to look for something else. In addition to this, it leaves some white residue - much like a sunscreen, although, it has got no UV filter.<br />I have a sensitive, combination skin and so far I haven't been able to find a daily cream which would not cause my face to break out (with the exception of Neutrogena oil free moisture for combination skin, so I'll probably revert back to it, although, I wish it were more moisturizing). The fact this one did break me out might not mean the cream is bad, just perhaps not a good match for my skin type or someone with a similar skin type.",1

1,Simply didn't work well. It was applied correctly but it just didn't stay put.,1

2,"Ultra thin.  Doesn't feel sturdy, feels like they will break or bend very easily. Not sure they can withstand very much use.",1
1,I bought this without first smelling it based upon a recommendation from someone. The stuff stinks. It smells like rotten coffee poured on someone wearing too much cheap cologne. I threw it away. It is gaggingly bad. I don't know how they can call this cologne. The bottle is the only thing worth anything.,1
2,I didn't really like this color or the feel.  It doesn't stay on like some others I've tried in different brands.,1
2,Have to say that I cannot give an accurate rating at this point because I'm not quite sure how to use them! The idea I had in mind was not doable once I got them. Cannot find any step by step info anywhere after doing multiple searches including YouTube (instructions on package are written in Korean). Found one blog about it but no actual instructions. Disappointed,1
1,When I first tried these I was amazed that my pony tail would stay in place!  It was great as I have very thick hair.  After using them for a whole day my hair would become wrapped around the bands when I would try to take them out.  Not realizing the extent pulled the hair band out of my hair.  I now have patches of hair in the back of my head that are shorter than the rest.  These bands ripped my hair out.  If I had cut these out I would have gotten the same result.  Beware and be careful if you want to keep all of your hair when using these!,1
1,I wish the bottle was full and not used.I received it and left a review before I opened it BIG MISTAKE!I Didn't think I had to check to see if nail polish was used.,1
2,"I don't like the feel of it at all. I tried it first on back of my hand, and within a few minutes it was like dried glue. Glad I didn't use it on my face too.",1
2,This fragrance is a little too strong for me.  I like my lotion to be lightly scented and this isn't.  It is pretty pungent.,1
1,Sent different product,1
1,"I love proactiv but, this seller scammed me big time! After receiving it in the mail I not only realized that the product was a &#34;trial size&#34; not a 30 day supply whatsoever. If that doesn't make it bad enough I was signed into a recurring payment plan with proactiv from this purchase too! Who says I have the money in my account for a recurring payment! It's crazy someone can do this without your consent! Watch out amazon customers this is the first time I've ever had a bad experience on this site...",1
2,"This is ok, but it did make my face break out. I went back to Dermalogica products skin smoothing cream! So glad I did my face is back to smooth and refreshed! Love Dermalogica!",1
2,"after waiting weeks for thr shampoo to arrive, i couldn't wait to lather up and send the itchy scalp goodbye. i was so disapointed that the shampoo didn;t work as well as head and sholders, so don;t waste your money and time on this stuff.",1
1,"Heard from a friend that it was very nice so I tried it but I really dislike it.  Smells like a very cheep perfume, though it's not.",1
1,"I was using the product twice a day for 5 days, and on the 5th day had bad itching on both my thighs where I had been applying the gel. On both legs I had gotten huge bumps like large bug bites. They appeared in clusters, one leg had about 10 bumps and the other 4. I usually do not react this way to new products. This is just my experience to it and my skins reaction, but I had never seen anything like it! I stopped using product and they are slowly going away.",1
1,"I bought this hairdryer 6 months ago after having the previous model for 2 years and being very happy with it. I have been using it an average amount, maybe 10 minutes a day. It's worked great until recently. Now, whenever I turn the dryer to high, sparks literally shoot out of the end of the dryer towards my hair! It appears a small piece inside the dryer is the cause. It's still under the 1 year warranty, so I'm calling Conair, but I will not be buying this dryer again.",1
2,"I'm post menopause and found out that over a year ago my Estradiol level was just about nothing. Starting having different issues from feeling tired, depressed, hot flashes and worst of all painful sex. Also had this sinus thing were my sinuses would continually swell up making it hard to breath. I've been using this along with natural progesterone cream for the past four months.My dosage was every morning , one pump and I'd use the progesterone at night. I started to feel really pumped up and decided to back off using the creams every other day but started having heart palpitations, trouble sleeping and anxiety. So I decided it might be wise to check my levels.  Got my results today and my levels are in a normal balance for the most part but I just need to increase my progesterone to every night to balance the Estrogen/Progesterone level. So I had become estrogen dominant. This cream works! In over four months I went from almost nothing regarding my Estradiol to within a normal with supplementation range. Note: Just as others had posted, if you still have your uterus it is wise to also use a natural progesterone cream with it.  *Update 04/07/2015 After repetitively having heart palpitations/racing after many attempts to lower or spread out the dosage I just cannot use this. I also felt it contributed to having anxieties at night. Bad because my energy level is so low since I'm not taking it. I am going to again use the Estriol cream.",1
2,"I used to use one of Dove's shampoos before switching over to this because the Dove shampoo stopped working after a few weeks and left my hair feeling very stringy and dry. I used this shampoo for about two weeks until I realized that it was extremely drying. I have used several other shampoos, like Naturoli's, Avalon Organics, and Nature's Gate, and this is by far my least favorite. It just took all the shine out of my hair and left it almost brittle. I don't use a conditioner because it makes my hair too heavy and bundle together, but if I were to continue using this, I would have to.",1
1,"I ordered 2 of these mirrors for Christmas gifts. They look nice. For the first mirror, I tried to insert the adapter onto the base. It's a tight fit, and with just a slight push, the entire adapter receiver collapsed inside the mirror base. I then used 4 C batteries instead. It didn't turn on. For the second mirror, I bypassed the idea of using the adapter and used the batteries right away. The mirror turned on once the batteries were inserted but there was absolutely no way to turn off the mirror without taking the batteries out. The knob turned, but there was no \\""catch\\"" to enable it to turn either off or on. The quality of these are so poor, they're just above landfill material. VERY disappointed.",1
1,"I found this to be a total disappointment.  I had been using Estee Lauder BB cream and hoped this would be almost as good, but it's pretty inferior.  First the colors are extremely light, even going for a shade darker than normal.  There is a LOT of water so it's hard to work with because it's so runny.  I left it open for 5 days to get some of the water to evaporate and that helped a little.  With or without the extra water, it's very streaky and takes a lot of blending to look natural.<br /><br />The one positive is that I don't get too shiny by the end of the day.<br /><br />Overall this is not worth buying; and I'll never buy it again.  I felt pretty ripped off by how poor the quality was.",1
1,"Just tossed it in the trash after a week, it doesn't cut worth a damn.  Only good point is it is smooth against the skin, but leaves the hair right where it found it.",1
2,"Got this at  Sephora and the makeup artist cautioned me that if I use this over my entire face I end up with a green cast to my skin - and he is so right!  I can use the green from Physician's Formula without getting that cast, but Make Up For Ever is just too dark a green.  I use it just on the red portions of my face and that is okay but I am not impressed, and when I used it over some dark red bruising, it made the bruises look even darker.  I don't have any trouble with the applicator, as I am very careful at pressing down as I've practiced so I get just the right amount (almost none) each time (I hold the bottle with both hands, I don't leave it sitting on a counter or table when I press the plunger).<br /><br />To those having trouble getting it to cover your pores - apply with your fingers, not with a brush.  The brush will pull the product out of your pores, while your fingers will leave it in.",1
2,If I use too frequently I break out in itchy red rash under my arms.  Such a shame considering you need to use more often due not being an antiperspirant. Will be looking for a better alternative.,1
2,"Super sticky and goopy.. It got on my wig, it took two days to get off my hair line. The brush it comes with is useless because the product is very thick and it gets everywhere. I would try a product that is thinner and less goopy.",1
1,This sponge is so little and totally useless.  I threw it in the trash as soon as I saw it.  Very disappointed.,1
1,Does not work for me.,1
1.0,Horrible and synthetic hair,1
1,This product used to be amazing and really was scent free.  The last several bottles I purchased have a distinct perfume like odor to them and had to be returned.  If you are fragrant and chemically sensitive I would no longer recommend this product.,1
1,"It cracked in a week. A week after that the handle came off. The look is great. The size is perfect, but it's a piece of crap.",1
1,I wouldn't even give it a one star rating!<br />Don't waste your money. It's absolute garbage!,1
1,"I have many spider veins in my lower legs, in the ankle area.  I was willing to try this product since I had read that vitamin K was actually good at removing the appearance of spider veins.  It didn't work.  I could not see any difference at all.",1
2,"The shipping speed was standard. Upon receiving the 2) tiaras I ordered, one had jewels broken off. So I returned both. I could have just glued them back but why should I when I paid for a complete item.",1
1,"I recently returned to 'old fashion,' shaving & am using Col Conk's glycerine shave soap.  I compare the Feather's Hi-Stainless Double Edge blades against the Merkur Double Edge blade.  After using the Merkur blade that came with my razor handle, I replaced it with a Feather blade.  The very first Feather shave was a decidedly different from the Merkur.  I had a return of razor burn and skin nicks/cuts that I had not had during the prior week.  I tried to stick it out, but after the 3rd Feather blade shave I had had enough.  I switched back to the Merkur and on that day, my shave was without razor burn or the nicks/cuts I had had.  For my beard, I will not be using the rest of the Feather blades & sticking with the Merkur.",1
1,I'm not sure if this is an authentic product! If it's not it's a really close knock off.,1
2,The tools in this set are ok but not my favorite. My biggest problem is the cheap case. It won't stay closed and I have to put a rubber band around it to keep it closed. Inexpensive but you get what you pay for I guess.,1
1,Works great when plugged into AC but won't function after about two days in cordless mode (won't stay charged) w/normal use.,1
1.0,"not a strong treatment, doesnt do whats advertised.",1
2,Ingredients are mostly a bunch of chemicals and the size of the bottle is very small.,1
1,"My Mother-in-Law recently read a book about Coco Chanel, which we bought her for Christmas at Amazon.com. She enjoyed the story of Coco so much we decided to buy her some Chanel perfume for her birthday. Returning to Amazon, we found the perfume at a great price and placed the order with BargainsInc. I sent a message to the vendor explaining that I wanted to expedite the purchase because it was to be a birthday gift. I never heard back. A month went by and I still heard nothing, even to the two messages I sent requesting the order's status. I have now filed a claim with Amazon to recoup the money paid for this item. As soon as that claim is settled I will be shopping for Chanel once again. This time however, I will avoid BargainsInc, as I would strongly advise everyone else to do as well.",1
1,Drakkar Noir is my brand since I was 26 and I always loved the perfume & why I bought it but this perfume seems to be duplicate and doesn't last more than a hour.,1
2,"They are okay, best for days I'm not wearing eyeshadow. Otherwise they don't show.",1
1,"This item was shipped to me in a timely manner, the problem came when I opened the plastic USPS bag it came in to see a dented, abused gift set. All the perfumes were fine but the box didn't look presentable. I was also extremely upset to see a sticker on the box that says suggested retail is $48.00. I paid $20.00 over suggested retail and then another $5.00 for shipping. I feel I got completely ripped off by this seller. But I guess I'm stupid one for buying it.",1
2,It works but is too much of a hassle. Having to boil the heat packs or microwave them was time consuming and bothersome. Then on the third or so use the gel pack busted. I tired of thirty second intervals so i left it a minute. I now solely use my hard heat bonnet and it works perfectly each time.,1
2,"I wanted something like a flat iron/curling iron combo.  I was thinking this would open and close like a flat iron, clamp onto my hair and I could easily pull and twist my hair around it.  Instead you just slide your hair into the gap in between, then you can turn like you would with a curling iron.  Well, for me it didn't work well at all!  My hair kept getting stuck in the seams and at some points I'd have to rip my hair out to get the thing off my head.  Might work well for super straight and smooth hair.  I have kind of average hair, not curly, not pin straight.",1
2,no- no happy with this product too cumbersome to use and you need<br />a long extension cord to reach to the floor. I wish I would have<br />waited until the new cordless model came out......to me this<br />product not worth the $$.,1
2,I like the smell very much although it disappears in several minutes. This aftershave doesn't include oil and the skin remains dry. Also the price is too high in my opinion.,1
2,scent did not work for me but I gave it to a friend who liked it very much,1
1,"I can't even begin to explain the scent, it is a nauseating, old lady rose smell, with a burst of stench that permeates throughout the NYC subway.  Just horrible.",1
1,"i bought and tried this, once i went in water, my skin was all gooey and slippery and i looked like a shedding lizard, guessing this product is mostly for tanning bed, if your in the sun and laying on raft in pool, i would highly recommend Austalian Gold bronzing dry oil spray intensifier with color boost maximizer, for a great great tan,",1
1,"This item is not as pictured.  It does not have pearls on it....just one big diamond shaped pearl in the middle and very cheap looking \\""crystals\\"" on either side.  Save your money,these barrettes are tiny and cheap!  A waste of money.",1
1,"I heard such great things about this cleansing conditioner, so I spent this much money, used it 3 times and each time I used it, my hair came out in wads.  I have never had a problem with my hair coming out with any product but this one.  I personally will not ever buy any WEN products again.",1
1,"These extensions are such poor quality. The clips don't stay in, the hair is very fragile and THIN. I ended up just throwing them away because they did not even match the quality of my own hair which is much thicker. These are definitely not worth your time and money. I do not understand how these can be considered &#34;remy&#34; hair. Remy hair is top quality. These are the lowest of quality imaginable. Only get them if you wish to waste our money.",1
1,This product smells good at first but after about a week it does not mask the smell its as if you never put deodorant on in the first place.,1
2,I was disappointed that the product I received does not match the posted photo.  The comb I recieved does have the rotating teeth - which is great for untangling hair but it's awkward to use because it has no handle.  The teeth completely line the comb.  The comb shown has a handle and then a line of teeth.  I would prefer that design and was disappointed not to receive it since I ordered 3 of these combs.,1
1,"I used this hair dryer for about 1.5 years.  I started noticing a light strange smell coming from the hair dryer.  I thought that the filter needed cleaning so I cleaned it out.  A couple of weeks later, the hot or warm blowing options stopped working.  Now it only blows cold air.  What a waste of money!",1
1,"I had high hopes for this product because I love that it is paraben free. However, the grains are too rough for delicate facial skin, especially if you already have sore blemishes.   This is more suitable for arms, legs, back and chest areas. If they were to refine the grains a bit more, I'd be all over this. Unfortunately, I ended throwing half the tube away :( Smells nice though.",1
2,Unfortunately this product is  very greasy. The non-existence of titanium dioxide is unacceptable and disappointing  for very sensitive  skin especially and after laser  treatments. In the sun exposure the product is very shiny and greasy: It can not cover the redness and it will dye your skin and the fingers very much. It must be reformulated.,1
1,Not as expected,1
1,"I've smelled this perfum before, at stores, so, at the time I smelled the perfume, I realized it's not original!!!!",1
2,"For such a well known product, I was pretty disappointed. It creased and caked very quickly, and I didn't notice any improvement of my under eye area. Have used a drug store brand that worked better.",1
1.0,Every brush I used left little brush hairs everywhere,1
1.0,Made my hair feel worse!,1
2,"It works, but the bottom piece already fell off and it is extremely weak.  Barely cuts anything more than fuzz without pulling. I've already purchased a better replacement.",1
2,"It's a ok shaver, but save your money and get a Braun instead it's just a better product.",1
1,"Too dark and very unnatural looking, after I put them on, I took them off and decided not to wear them to work like I usually do; I may use them at a later time, maybe to an evening event, where the lights are dim...",1
2,"No charger, only batteries! Serious feature lacking in this regard.<br />I would love a travel size irrigator, however, I don't like the hassle of buying/changing batteries. Give me a charger!",1
1,"Not so good, at least for me.  They are ill fitting, and uncomfortable and I was not able to get them to mold at all.  They are better than nothing, I suppose, but there are better products out there for this purpose.",1
2.0,just ok,1
1,I broke out all over my cheeks after just two applications. I want to return it.,1
2,"These sleeves were not too durable.  As soon as I tried to put the first one on, it ripped.  The second one also ripped as I was trying to put it on.  The third one went on with no problem.",1
2,"I ordered the Istubble because it seemed to have decent reviews and I wanted an accurate beard trimmer. When I got it I plugged it in and, started to shave. By the time I was done I had blood dripping down my neck, and I had to finish with my regular old Wahl hair trimmer. The trimmer is just not meant for people with thick tough hair. Then I returned the trimmer via post and never recieved a refund, so all in all the purchase was a loss for me. I just wanted to let people know not to buy it if you have a thick \\""russian\\"" hair folicles.   Good luck   -Eric",1
2,"This product did help to clear my acne, and it was fast acting.  I saw results after only two applications.  I experienced no skin irritation and thought the cleanser felt fine when I applied it.<br /><br />However, I was very unhappy with the extent to which this bleached my washcloths and towels.  There is a warning that states &#34;avoid contact with hair or dyed fabrics, which may be bleached by this product.&#34;  However, I interpreted that to mean that if I spilled a big blob of it on my shirt, it might bleach it.  I didn't expect that it would bleach my washcloth, and I absolutely didn't expect it to bleach the towels that I used to pat my face dry after I had thoroughly rinsed my face.<br /><br />I'm not comfortable using a product that is so strong that it bleaches a towel even after I've done my best to rinse it all away, and I also don't particularly want to use a bleaching agent that apparently stays on my skin even after I've tried to rinse it away.<br /><br />While this product is definitely effective, I will happily return to using something that is milder but less alarming (and damaging to my towels).",1
1,I really didn't feel any different after using this. The adhesive is not strong enough to hold the pads on your feet. I had to use tape to get them to stay on. I really wouldn't recommend these to anyone. They are a waste of time and money.,1
1,"This is more like BLack Black Black... Such a dark color, i have medium brown hair and this is like black. Maybe I should of ordered blonde to get the right color. Also it had a heck of a time coming out have to try a bunch of times to get any out.",1
1,The container looked a little bit different than the real one I've used for years.  There is also a slight perfume smell and the main reason I like L'Oreal's Futur-e is due to not having an annoying smell.  Hopefully I can find the original.,1
1,Too tight on big toe.  Cuts off circulation.,1
2,"Good - smells nice, may or may not actually work as deodorant (I wasn't able to use it long enough to know), good customer service, and reasonably priced.<br /><br />Bad - I have somewhat sensitive skin (not overly sensitive), and I broke out into a horrible, horrible rash. It spread down my side, all over, and caused painful blisters. I ended up having to go to the doctor who said it was a small staph infection, and got put on medication. It's been a pretty terrible experience. I normally wouldn't give a bad review, but I would hate for this to happen to others, so just thought I better share my experience.",1
1,Didn't work!,1
2,"Its is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy too frosty for me. I mean... I'm a black female, so it might be my skin tone, but I still think its waaaaaaaayyyyy too frosty. It is so frosty, when i put it on, There were kids around me singing and dancing in the snow. Yeah, I turned into a damn snowman when I put this lip gloss on. Its that frosty.",1
1,"Dry and immovable. Once you put it on, it's there, won't smear or blend.<br />Also difficult to remove. I would not recommend it or purchase again.",1
2,"I mean, it seemed good in the first place. then the toothbrush won't charge after three months use. Apparently there's a quality issue.",1
2,"I was under the impression that there were going to be three necklaces. I was not given a choice of which color I was choosing, it shows three in the picture, therefore I was expecting three necklaces. Creative advertising is say.....",1
1,I don't know how there are a lot of good reviews but these have a terrible taste!! I don't know if I'm doing something wrong but it's like almost like burnt rubber. I used it on my rba kanger mini and rebuilt aspire Atlantis coil and has a very bad taste. Almost made me throw up!,1
1,"This was one of the worst dry shampoos I've tried. I saw it recommended in a magazine or two and then it had good reviews on here so I decided to give it a try. My somewhat thin, blond hair felt like it was covered in gunk after spraying this on and brushing it through my hair like I do with the other dry shampoos I like. It also smelled really weird. I used this 2-3 times and then just threw it out. Life's too short for nasty feeling/smelling hair.<br /><br />I recommend trying Psssssst Instant Spray Shampoo or Batiste Dry Shampoo Blush Hair Shampoos instead.",1
1,"When i first boght it i didnt realized it was without the box, my bad. But the product is fake and it was broken. I asked the seller about the box and they sad the box was too demaged. But the product was too. And it doesnt fell the same in the skin as the original that i boght in dutyfree at first time",1
2,"From all the reviews I read I was really expecting not only something different, but something that that seemed like a miracle for me.  I have been searching for a waterproof mascara mostly (to try to avoid smudges) that dries fast, keeps my lashes curled, doesn't clump & washes off with soap & water (wear contacts so an oily eye cleaner is out of the question).  This mascara is not that special mascara as it sometimes crumbles under your eyes during the day.  Also, I have lashes that want to stay straight & this mascara does not dry fast enough to keep my lashes curled. This was an expensive mistake.",1
2,Eh it was okay,1
1.0,"Don't buy this, it doesn't work!",1
1,"It looked like it was working 1-2 weeks in, but it's 5 months later, and my big toe still looks like.... something that no one will ever see again. The directions are pretty vague, but I used it daily. Sometimes, 2x daily... just in case.",1
2,I purchased this as a moisturizer with some sun protection.  It smells too much like sunscreen to use as a daily moisturizer.,1
2,"Experimenting with lipstick colors is fun! Love to mix up my lippies and am not afraid to branch out from my usual MAC staples. Kat Von D's lipstick appealed to me, however the color is very vibrant, however the once apied, the color did not match the item. The consistency did not provide even coverage. I wanted to love this product, but will stick with MAC lipsticks. Returned this item and went striaght to the MAC counter and purchased Show Orchid. You never know until you try, but sometimes you just have to stick with what works.",1
1,"Compared to the Resmed head gear I was trying to replace, this was much thinner and less elastic.  The lack of elasticity significantly affects  how stable and effective the seal is that the mask makes with my face.  This makes it not completely worthless, but nearly so.  I also have doubts about its durability.  The Resmed mask was elastic enough that you could adjust the Velcro to the fit I wanted, then slide the mask off without undoing the Velcro.  That does not seem possible with this head gear.  I am worried that undoing the Velcro every time I take the mask off will cause the Velcro to wear out unusually soon.  Also, how light weight the material is makes me suspect that what elasticity it does have, will not be very durable either.",1
1,"I gave this product 1 star as I purchased to remove discolorations on my left cheek.  I have been using for 2 + months morning and evening along with sunscreen and (extremely dissapointed) have not noticed any sort of difference.  After reading all the prior reviews, I was highly hopeful this would work but it has not.  Looks like I have to get a chemical peel or laser to remove the spots.",1
1,"I purchased this, received the package, with the bottom slit and no whitestrips. were not included. I contact and filed a complaint. My money was refunded. Will not order again. n",1
1,"I knew it was to good to be true but it is what it is. I received a Fake Cool Water, the bar code on the bottle did not match the bar code on the box period. I later bought another Cool Water @ a department store and compare the difference . The cap on the Fake came off to easy and it didn't last very long . The real Cool Water match the bar code on the Box . I just hope people will be more caution buying fragrance online .",1
1,I ordered 3 dental retainer box tray denture mouth night guard cases based on the photo at  Amaozon. what I got was not what was in the picture- it is bigger has 2 holes and does not fit in my shirt pocket- Smile Medic needs to change the photo.

1,"I love the product, BUT the nozzle was broken off when it arrived.  Therefore, it was unusable. I was very  disappointed.",1
1,"If you have a fairly heavy whiskers than this is not the product for you. They are not of very high quality and produce dragging and pulling, which would mean they were not sharp. For me they are useless, a person with a lighter growth may like these and the lower price and rate it higher.",1
1,Just a waste of $$$.  I cannot recommend this product at all.  Just glorified toilet water.  Don't buy this .,1
1,I think these were a complete waste of $$$.  Just using a waterpik gets down into these pockets without trying to wedge these into your gumline.,1
1,My first ever review - got so tangled using this product I had no choice but to CUT my hair off!,1
2,Not quite at all ...<br />useless for me ...,1
1,"Just wanted everyone to know......DO not expect this before the first of Juvember, 2280......I was tracking the package and so far it's made it to Hong Kong.....sent a pricier model back to another provider(it got here in four[4] days.....wow......so order it before you want to use it.....by the time you do......it'll be there :)",1
1,"The Shine Max product that I was looking for was actually a \\""smoother\\"" not the spray. (This product has been discontinued by Pureology.)

1,"Product arrived a day before it was due. The colors are just beautiful. They go on with three brush strokes and dry quickly. The problem is it chipped terrible within hours of application. It took forever to remove and stained my nails. I will try experimenting with different base and top coats. Hopefully I will have better luck.<br />UPDATE:<br />I just took the green off my nails and although it was beautiful and I had many compliments, I can not recommend this polish. My nails are stained \\""glow in the dark\\"" yellow. I have tried everything to clean them, but they are stained. If you like a variety of light and dark polish, this is not for you. Stained nails, chips quickly and is just awful to remove.  DO NOT BUY.",1
1,Product left my hair brittle and dry. It caused many split ends. It had the complete opposite effect from what it advertised.,1
1,"Destroyed the surface of my nails!!!<br />Purchased at Dollar Tree.<br />Not shaped very well.<br />Too small and had to piece.<br />Kind of thick and weird-feeling, but went on fairly easily and lasted very well for two weeks with only some wear at the tips.<br />Upon removing them, I found that the adhesive had actually eaten into the surface of my nails!!!!!<br />Definitely intend to hold Essie responsible.<br />Does this constitute a personal injury case?",1
2,"Unfortunately, this chair is too cheaply made. It falls over every time I get up from using it. The seat is not comfortable. Go with a different model.",1
1,This item is crap.  It fogs up the first minute you start the shower and stays that way no matter what you do. If I had to I would not purchase this again.,1
1.0,The product had a crack when i recieved it. I informed it to you guys the same day.....but no action.........disappointed,1
1,"I've tried many powders and spray looking for a solution to my oily hair. I don't want to have to wash my hair every day, so I need to use a dry shampoo type of product. I tried the Finely powder after reading several reviews. To my disappointment the powder was awful. It felt disgusting in my hand and even worse in my hair. It almost felt silicone-like. It truly felt disgusting in my hair. I guess it helped absorb some of the oil in my hair, but so does baby powder. The color didn't do anything different from baby powder either. I would love to return the item, but I immediately threw out the packaging once I received it because I was so sure it would be my answer because of all the reviews I had read. Bottom line: expensive, super small bottle, bad product. Flat out unfortunate. (I have found that Batiste dry shampoo spray works the best out of all the sprays out there. Fair price too. Otherwise, Shower-to-Shower powder works well- better than regular baby powder).",1
1.0,"I was disappointed!  Despite all of the positive reviews, I found it difficult to use.  It went on fairly smoothly, but if you mess up, it's there to stay.  You need make-up remover to get this stuff off.  Also, it didn't last very long.  I only used it for approximately 2 weeks before it dried up.  I used it daily - however, I generally get 2 months of use out of an eyeliner before I need to purchase again.  It wasn't worth the price.",1
1.0,no me han llegado,1
2,"The only thing good about this item is that it is cheap. It was able to somewhat straighten my incredibly curly, thick hair but that was only after going over the same sections of hair numerous times. In the end my hair would still come out somewhat curled, frizzy and puffy. This straightener is somewhat heavy to hold and the plates do not get hot enough.",1
2,"I think mine is a fake, or old...that's if cologne can get old lol.  I bought my 1st bottle from Macy's and the fragrance was awesome.  I ordered this bottle because the price is much cheaper.  The fragrance smells similar, but changes soon after.  It isn't nearly as strong as the original and doesn't last long at all.  I've been bamboozled!!!",1
2,"When looking at the list of ingredients, you would assume this would work, however it did not work on my pesky Melasma. I finally broke down and got prescription obagi and within a week, I'm already seeing the results.",1
2,"These are EXTREMELY fake looking nails. Not one of them glued down properly. Only the little finger and the ring finger nails fit the size of my nails, and I have used plenty of Lee Press On Nails with no problem. These are simply done cheaply with bad glue. Convenience-wise, they only take a few minutes to peel and glue once you find the nails that somewhat fit each finger. I do not recommend these.",1
1,I was very disappointed as the first time I used the nail clippers they promptly broke into several parts. Too much work to return for refund.,1
2,"I've been on the hunt for an alternative to the expensive Gillette Fusion blades. I'm a head shaver.. I keep it bald, so I need a good razor that will shave close, smoothly and last a while. The Fusion do the job for me, but hurt my wallet. I thought I had found one the I picked up a few of these... Well I was mistaken.  At first the razors seemed to be of decent quality and I liked the first few strokes going down my cheek. Not quite as smooth as the Fusions, but it was acceptable. I'm a head shaver.. I keep it bald, so I need a good razor that will shave close, smoothly and last a while. When it was time for me to get to my head is when my thoughts on this razor changed immediately. I go against the grain for the closest shave on my head. Not even 3 strokes into shaving my head these blades cut me ..and cut me badly. The razor literally shaved off a decent size chunk of my scalp. Large enough for me to grab with my fingers and pull out from between the blades.  Don;t let this review steer you away if you're buying these to shave you face, because for that I think these blades will do fine... But they tore my head up!",1
1.0,Hardly any fragrance. Big waste of $.,1
1,"Of all the things I've purchased on-line, this has been hands down the most disappointing.  The curler gets so hot everywhere you can't get it anywhere near your eyes because the metal part will burn you.  By the time the metal cools enough to get it close to your eye, it's no longer effective as a heated curler.  When I finally did manage to get a bit of curl into my lashes (after repeated attempts and having to heat and then let cool the curler enough so that I wouldn't burn my eye), the curl didn't last.  Save your money.  As far as I'm concerned, this is a total scam.",1

Hard, swollen, HOT, painful nodules all over both cheeks. Red skin, itching, red, itchy eyes (even though I was being careful not to get it near my eyes). I'd used Benzoyl Peroxide for several years in the past, with good success, but concluded after using this product that I'd developed an allergy to BP, as these are classic symptoms of allergy to it. Only recently, have I mustered up the courage to try a different product with BP in it, and discovered that it wasn't the BP, but the Acne.org product that had caused the problem... I could have saved myself almost 2 years of only partially successful pursuit of other methods of clearing my acne, including tretinoin, as well as a lot of emotional and physical pain, and scarring if I'd known that :(.",1

1,I hate it. Would not recommend it .,1
2.0,I had high hopes for an easier way to cut my own hair short. I have used the Remington short hair cutter and found it acceptable. This thing does a poor job of evenly cutting the hair though. I followed the directions for how to use the tool as they show in the video for the product but it left patches of hair uncut. Maybe it works ok for some kinds of hair but it was almost useless with mine. The only use I found for this is to start cutting with this thing and then finish it off with the Remington short hair cutter. I don't think they tested this thing before selling it. I oiled the blades up like they suggested before my first use and it still started to feel like it was pulling some of my hair out. I am hopeful that some day a worthy self short hair cutting tool will be available but the time has not yet come.,1
1,"I can't believe the high ratings for this stuff. I broke out horribly from the oil free version. Garnier uses the cheapest ingredients that clog pores, no oil required. It's a myth that if it's oil-free, it won't cause breakouts, and it's definitely a myth that all oil WILL break you out. Evidenced by this garbage, which gave me the worst breakout I've had in years. And no, I do not typically break out. I switched to another brand after using this crap for two days and my skin went back to normal. Don't waste your money!",1

I'm returning the product because I don't want to support whack jobs like this and his family, who continue to keep the label as a memorial to Dr. Bronner. The only thing it's a memorial to, is/are how crazy he and his family are/was. They would all do well to enroll in a business ethics 101 course.

I had read the reviews and assumed that it would be a wise purchase but once I received the brushes I realized that only the blush, powder, and large fan brush were actually natural hair. The rest of the brushes are acrylic. You ever tried applying eyeshadow with an acrylic brush? It cakes and it's terrible.<br /><br />So A+ for the powder and blush brushes but the rest can only be used for liner, lipstick, and gloss.

Once they did arrive, the candles would not burn. Contacted seller and was sent replacement candles. These too did not burn. Told seller I wanted refund and COULD NOT get one.<br /><br />Below is a partial response from the seller:<br /><br />\\""The manufacturer (Pacifica) has verified the lot number of the candles you received. They do agree that there are times when a candle wick has been cut too short and thus will not burn properly\\"".<br /><br />So basically I am OUT $75.00 for expensive candles that are defective and that will NOT burn. What is the purpose of a candle if they can't be burned???? I have bought cheap candles at Target that burn better and know if they didn't Target would at least give you a refund.<br /><br />I am astonished that neither Pacifica or this seller would issue a $75 refund knowing that the merchandise being sold is defective and to keep a loyal (now ex-loyal) Pacifica customer happy. Obviously, neither care about the products they sell or their customers.<br /><br />Avoid BOTH the manufacturer (Pacifica) and seller at ALL costs!",1

Also, if you have a small mouth like me, your teeth will catch all the color towards the back of your lips. Never Again!",1

1,"I don't recommend this product. It has several design and usage flaws that must be discussed. First of all, it's creators had the idea that all men are created of equal size. We know that this isn't true. I purchased this product back in 2003, and  tried using it for about a month. When I tried to put it on, it wouldn't fit over the head of my penis. This is a problem that can't be overlooked  because it claims that you can urinate while wearing it. I tried to urinate after wearing it for several hours, and what resulted was a blockage due to the \\""one size fits all\\"" insertion, and the urine back-flowed and went everywhere except for the in the toilet. Another problem is the method in how one is supposed to use the device. One is supposed to use medical or adhesive tape to attach the skin of the penis just where the foreskin was cut off to the metal slider. From there, the user will pull the skin over the  head  of the penis that is taped slider and secure it with the screw on the slider. Now this will cause discomfort, residue from the tape to be left on the shaft of the penis,and cause the skin below the foreskin scar to be stretched out. The discomfort for the stretching is rather painful. The ere were several time when I was trying to removed it, and the metal slider fell back, pinching the skin between two metal points. The problem with the tape is that it caused irritation, and lint would get stuck to it it wouldn't wash off very easily. The only thing that got it off quick was rubbing alcohol which can cause further irritation. The last problem with how it will stretch out the skin on the shaft of the penis. If one is sexually active (And I was while trying to wear this thing) the skin will be stretched out to the point where bacteria can form and pool in the stretched out microscopic cavities caused from the device. This can result in a variety of skin diseases and it happened to me. The aliment that I had was a rash that resembled acne but couldn't be poppedand was covering the shaft of the penis. I know that it wasn't a STD because my wife (girlfriend at the time) and I were both tested and came back with a clean bill of health. Doctors didn't know what to make of it, and the only way I was able to get rid of it was by soaking in a warm bath with anti-bacterial soap diluted into the water. It took almost three months of soaking twice a day for the rash to clear up, but once it did, I pretty much gave up on trying to \\""grow back\\"" was sliced off of me as a newborn infant. Look, guys, you might have a feeling of envy towards those that still have it, but using something like this isn't worth it. It caused me a lot of problems, stress and an feeling that I wasted my money. It did start to re-grow a little ridge of skin but look what I just described for you. If its gone, its gone, and trying to re-created something that is missing certain glands and original nerve endings is going to leave you with a less than satisfactory result. Thank-you for your time.",1

Add to it the completely inflated price for this product (I expect to pay more per ounce for a travel size version....but not more than I pay for the regular product!) and I'm giving this offer one star. I would give it a zero if I could. A complete rip off.,1
1,"I have rosacea problem (as i was diagnosed, but not sure if it is),<br />the entire soap bar is washed out and it did not help to reduce my skin problem (itchy, red cheeks, and some small pimples with little white puss heads). After using this soap my skin gets more red and irritated. But soap's fume is nice.<br />I put one start because some one in reviews asked to use it for rosacea problem.  But this product did not help me.",1
1,Was too hot on my skin caused a burning kind of feeling made my skin look burnt and not tan,1
1,product did not deliver or live up to the emuaid guarantee.  I purchased this to treat the pain and itching associated with shingles.<br />It did nothing to help either.  I tried it on mosquito's bites and it did not help with this this either.  This was a very pricey product.<br />Could have purchased  calamine lotion for a few bucks and gotten much better results.,1
2,I was seriously afraid that I was going to be stung by bees because of the smell of this product. It's like putting vanilla pudding in your hair and overpowered everything in your day!,1
1,These blades are poor quality.  Spend the $10 more and buy real Norelco blades.  The blades are dull and malfunction.,1
1,It doesn't work for me.  Gray hairs stays gray after apply this product for 2 hours,1
1,Didn't have fresh pleasant scent I'm accustumed to,1
2.0,"Shampoo lathers great, smells good, but the conditioner is impossible to get out of the bottle. I think I need to cut it open. They need better packaging, will not purchase again",1
1,I put fresh new aaa batteries in it twice. both times the next day the batteries went dead. it drains battery power when not in use.another piece of Chinese junk from the people planning on taking over the world. ha! good luck with that. just stick to making chop suey u jerks.,1
1,"I absolutely hate it. it is very messy and impossible to clean off the skin or any surface it touches , I got the whole kit including the oil that is recommended to remove wax, but it didnt work well either. i got bruised in the areas where I couldnt get the wax off easiy and ended it stopping mid way through.",1
2,"I wish I had researched into the stuff companies are putting into these sorts of products before I bought this. This one has just about everything bad that's commonly used. Polyethylene Glycol (PEG), Propylene Glycol (PPG), Methylisothiazolinone (MIT), and more. It does have more good ingredients than many of the well-known brands do, but I'll be looking elsewhere for conditioner that is healthy. I'm not taking the risk with known dangerous ingredients when I don't have to. I will try to remember to upload a \\""customer image\\"" of the ingredient list when I have some time.",1
2.0,Definitely not worth the money. I've been using this product for a couple of weeks now and haven't seen any changes at all in my skin.  Very disappointing.,1
1,"The color was pretty, but the smell of this lipstick is so horrible that I couldn't even stand to keep it on for more than a few seconds.  The smell of this lipstick is by far the worst I've ever smelled.  I'm so disappointed because it was such a pretty color, but I know this is one that I won't be wearing.",1
2,"this arrived new and sealed, I tried it and while it did make skin smooth, I did not see any change in looks of skin. Maybe it  takes longer -but since the name itself has 'instantly' I assumed that it would work instantly.",1
2,They will work but not very comfortable. Very stuff not flexible as I would have liked.,1
1,"When the product was delivered, the smell was overwhelming. The bottle had leaked ruining the box and depleting the product by a quarter. It was a mother 's day gift and I couldn't 't give it to my mother -in -law. What a disappointment.",1
1,"Amazon sent me one, (1)' UNO can of hairspray and the cost was $30.00!  It was. 7.6 oz. can.  I have made this purchase before and I got 12 cans for $30.00.  I am in the process of returning the item because  I will not pay $30.00 for one can of hairspray!  Very disappointed!",1
1,Color not same I used to use. It bleeds I only used once when I first received.  DID NOT LIKE,1
2,"Pretty color, didn't agree with my nail chemistry.",1
2,"It's a beautifully put together set, I'll give it that. I love the white leather box it came in and the brushes look like they are good quality. I can't stand that these brushes soak up my makeup though. I've been using these for just over a week and I have already used twice as much makeup as I normally would if I weren't using these brushes. It's a waste of money; I'd rather use my fingers to apply the makeup to my face, that way I use what I want...not more.",1
1,"Recently I had a lipid panel test. After reviewing with my doctor, I decided to purchase a blood glucose meter and the Cardiocheck Cholesterol Meter.  I decided to monitor my glucose and cholesterol as I try to improve my lipid panels for the next time I have a lipid panel test in five months.   Upon unpacking the unit and checking all components, I revise the unit put the batteries on. My first impression was that the unit, the screens and the strips looked more like a toy than a home-medical device.  I think that the materials used, the dimensions and LCD display look cheap, not that the price is cheap. This contrast poorly when compared to any blood glucose monitor construction and price.  I decided to take it for a test drive, so I used the included pink boxy lancets. It is a pre-loaded lancet that you need to press hard against your finger until the raised cover is pushed inside and the lancet is activated. It is extremely painful as you have to push hard and the needle is thick. I used it once and switched to the lancets I use for my blood glucose meter because my finger tip was bruised for an entire day after one use.  You might need to prick your finger(s) several times for each of the Total Cholesterol, HDL and Triglyceride tests. If you have used lancets from other companies you will find that many companies design their product to make it painless and the customer to use their product over others. I do not think that was the case with these lancets.  In addition, the capillaries collect enough blood for one single test, so you know those will go fast.    The test strips are a plastic with a window on which to deposit the blood. These windows have a paper-like recipient with the reactive agent that changes color with the blood. The color change in the bottom of the paper and it is the intensity in color change that the meter measures with reflective photometry. The test is susceptible to room temperature and lighting.  After several tests with the monitor,I found that the results vary enormously and more significantly the readings are way off from the lab results I got a couple of weeks ago and cholesterol does not change dramatically in such a short period of time.  I am returning the unit.  I think that I could do better with a quarterly professional lipid panel test.",1

1,"The quality of the wig was good and it came with 5 pretty clips. However, the color of the wig was Gray not &#34;Elsa&#34; blonde. Will be returning.",1
2.0,"Not only did I receive the wrong comb, which was extremely annoying, but when I took a close look the comb definitely has seams. I thought cricket made seamless combs smh. My advice: the hike price will usually indicate it's seamless. A $5 comb most likely isn't.",1
2,I read and followed the instructions but this product stay away from the acid is too strong I put this product on and in less than 1 minute my feet were burning I ran to shower and soaked my feet and they hurt for 24 hours not FDA approved no regulations don't buy from anywhere but good ol USA,1
2.0,"I have been trying safety razors to find one that suits me best.  I bought this one because of the massive number of great reviews on Edwin Jagger safety razors.  I didn't care for it.  The handle is too smooth and it really didn't cut all that well.  Returned it for another Merkur, but bought a 1904 Open Tooth.  Absolutely love the Merkur.",1

1,Dont like this product would not recommend,1
1,"This clearly says 12 count, I just received 1 (that's right, ONE) bar of soap in a huge box.  What the heck?????",1
2,Clunky and does not work very well,1
2,the oils put inside leak out when you put the brush back in.  There doesnt seem to be a stopper for the liquid when you pull out the brush so the brush and opening is a loose fit.,1
1,"As far as the realism of this product its spot on. Its not very big so if you an avid user of products like this its not very impressive. It does not squirt unless you use a very thin liquid. ****DANGEROUS**** TRIM THE TUBE AT THE TIP!!!**** If you dont your going to get hurt. We're talking blood and scratching and days of discomfort and maybe even permanent damage to your sensitive areas. I cant believe they let this product out the door without taking this extra step themselves. I know, I know sold as a novelty only but lets be serious we all know what these products are being used for and I would expect a company to try and protect the safety of their customers. Not very impressed at all.",1
1.0,Don't buy,1
1.0,This product contains collagen. Do you know where that comes from???  Animals. Do your homework. I wouldn't recommend this product.,1
1,"The package that it came in is completely torn up. The bottom is covered in tape and the back is ripped, and most of the text is faded. The actual product is fine I guess. But overall it was a waste of money.",1
2,cheaply made.  Already broke.,1
2,I have been using this for 2 weeks and have not seen any remarkable results. Hope it shows some signs soon.,1
1,"The water container is toooo small, requesting you to keep putting water every single day if want to sanitize the toothbrush.",1
2,very gloppy,1
2,Fragrance is quite odiferous and I used 5-6 times with no &#34;tan&#34; results. I usually love La Mer products but I am quite disappointed with this one. And expensive to boot.,1
1,i ordered this and it worked great for a month and then stoppped working i ended up throwing it away and buying a diffrent brand,1
1,"It took forever to get these. And to add to that, I got all that same color. I hate blue, I don't wear blue eye shadow and that's all I got. Not the variety that was shown.",1
2,Smells great but came  opened in a bag..and the body wash all in the sealed bag and on the outside....Yuck..what a mess..looking  for another seller..when I need more..,1
1,It was dried out when delivered,1
2,"I had high hopes for this moisturizer based on all the reviews and the list of ingredients.  I have highly sensitive skin with rosacea, and green tea is an important ingredient for fighting it.  However, because the list of ingredients shown is about half of what this actually contains (including perfume as fragrance, and other preservatives), and because even the photographs chosen do not allow you to see the ingredients, it began to sting and itch the minute I put it on.  Since it was so pricey I stuck with it for 3 days, but to no avail.  Manufacturers:  PLEASE disclose your complete ingredients!  I gave only two stars because of the lack of complete information.  I would not recommend ANYONE with sensitive skin, rosacea or allergies to try this -- and the smell is rather strong and perfume-like.",1
1,"This product made my eyes break out and I wanted to return it, but couldn't. Not happy.",1
2,"TL,DR below.    Well, it smells GREAT. It works \\""how it should,\\"" but the residue afterwords is what kills me. I don't see how this would be a good product to use, waste of money in my opinion. Here's my reason: after applying this lotion-like creme, it dries pretty fast after application, so overusing it is a possibility. However, the main reason I dislike this product is because after application and the \\""drying-to-powder\\"" aspect to it, there is a whole s*** ton of residue on my junk. It fills in the crevices around your scrotum for sure, but dries leaving white powder in the \\""cracks\\"" or \\""wrinkles\\"" if you would call it that and is hard to manage or \\""dust-off\\"". Otherwise this product seemed to be great...a go on lotion, dry as powder...you'd think that it would work. Who knows, try it out (from a friend first if possible) and maybe it'll work for you, but it didn't satisfy my needs. I might give it another shot with some sporting activities, but that's about it.    I am currently switching between using Cowboy Code (Manageable residue) and Gold Bond (Green) throughout the week. Cowboy Code for nights I am looking for a good time, and Gold Bond (Green) for nights at home alone (since it has that medicated smell.) These two products are what is working for now. The Gold Bond helps keep the bacteria at bay with its medicated powder I believe. I hope this review helps.    TL,DR: Too much white residue after application, leaving genitals looking like a winter wonderland. Might be better for sports or something that you wouldn't care about how looks like down there.    Try treatments of Cowboy Code and Gold Bond (Green) throughout the week (These two products have manageable residue, unlike some baby powders I would use that left a bunch of white marks on my underwear.)",1
1,I bought this for my daughter's birthday and was disappointed in the quality.  One of the eye shadows was shattered and crumbling all over the others.  What happened to paying a fair price for good quality merchandise?  I won't order from this brand again.,1
1.0,"Bought these for my wife, but they are no good for her because they are way too small.  I agree with other reviews that complain about the tiny size.  I cannot recommend these for normal sized women.  Midgets shop here!",1
1.0,"When I use this my hair feels horrible. Extra dry and coarse (if that is even possible). The smell is not that good either; it smells like... bamboo. I guess if you like the smell it would be okay, but I don't.<br /><br />I don't see any improvement. There are a lot of better things out there.",1

1,"My old Panasonic trimmer was showing it's age, so I thought I'd try a new one--a tremendous disappointment! This ER389K was completely unacceptable,and I returned it. The cutters are too fine, and the thicker beard hairs (most of them are,of course much thicker than the hair on your head!) pass over the cutting teeth unscathed. The height adjustment is difficult to set, and there isn't a positive enough lock. Finally, it is a rechargeable only cutter, without a cord option like my old one. <br />I decided that my 20 year old Panasonic ER200B still works well enough, and I congratulate Panasonic for that design. Why not remake it?",1
1,Wrong product in the box and not sealed,1
1,This stuff does NOT work!! My daughter got head lice at school and we treated her and competley got rid of nits and lice. I saw this product in the store and thought we would give it a try. We have been using this product for three weeks now at every bath and just tonight found lice on her again. Do not waste your time and money on this product. Highly disappointed,1
2,"After reading some of the reviews on this razor, I bought one to replace an old double head Braun I'd owned for years.  This one only has one shaving head and  leaves many long hairs.  It also takes many 'passes' to get a clean shave.  I tried to return it but couldn't because I'd owned it over a month.  I then purchased the double head Braun 7-720 which is a far superior razor.",1
1.0,"Doesn't work, waste of money.. don't even bother.",1
2,"I bought another brush from this maker and thought that was what I was buying again. Wrong!!!! This brush is super soft, too soft in my opinion. I will be trying something else in the future.",1
1,This is petroleum jelly. I should've read the ingredients before purchasing this. I wouldn't recommend it unless you just want petroleum jelly.,1
1,"Well, this did not work for me.  It is awkward to use and does not product the curl that is promised.  Stick to hot rollers if you are looking for curl.",1
2,It's beyond painful to use and so hard to get the hand of it. It does pull the hair but I just prefer to thread.,1
1,"I have been using Oral B brush for years and was very happy with the Oral B Pro White Head but they did not have them at the store so I bought this one, the Oral B Floss Action. When I looked at it I thought it would not clean good in the corners of the teeth since the round brush is not fully round but I said to myself, \\""oh, it should work.\\"" I figured I would not know for a few months. Well several months later and I was right. My teeth have dirty spots on them in the crevice corners and this never happened before. They should discontinue this brand. It does not work. I floss everyday with normal floss, a toothbrush cannot do that. I need to get a cleaning from dentist now and will order the Oral B Pro White Head again.",1
1,"These \\""supplements\\"" are a joke.  I have been using them religiously (taking one everyday) for the past 6 months and there has been NO improvement in my hair.  So basically I wasted $50 on this junk ($25 for a 3 month supply).  Oh, and don't forget that I've also been using Nioxin's Shampoo for Thinning Hair (ANOTHER $20) as well and even the combination of Nioxin products have done NOTHING.    Don't waste your money on this overpriced, overhyped garbage.  PLEASE save your money.  The only thing that can truly help thinning hair is Rogaine and possibly taking actual Biotin pills (which are a heck of a lot cheaper and have a higher dosage as well).  Again, I'm trying to save you money, so please don't waste your money on crap!",1

1,"I ordered the 1 oz bottle of Smokin Joes egyptian musk in a plain glass bottle (because i absolutely HATE the roller topped bottles), just as pictured on the page, and what i got instead, was an unnamed brand (presumably, HalalEveryDay brand), which smells awful - like flowers - and it is in a roller bottle.  As it turned out, my order came from a place located in the town next to mine, and yet, it took a full 10 days for me to receive my order from them!  Halaleveryday puts out an awful product, which is not the product pictured on this amazon page (at least, as of this review), and takes an incredibly long time to get your shipment to you. Terrible seller! Terrible product! if you want Smokin Joes, make sure to buy from smokin joes - hahaleveryday does not actually sell it!!  Bait and switch!  Shame on amazon for allowing it!",1

1,"Do your research before buying, I purchased this because I was travelling to Miami for spring break and I wanted to loose the little pouch on my lower abs. I try to workout at least 3-5 days a week and i'm pretty sure i'm better of doing that than taking these pills. What makes it even worse is that you have to take 6 humongous pills with 32 ounces of water everyday for 7 days straight, these pills actually gave me headaches and made me feel really dizzy after taking them for a while without seeing any results. I suggest you look else where for a better colon cleanse because this isn't what you're searching for to do the right job for you.",1

2,What was I thinking.  I bought this to smooth out the appearance of my face.  It has a chalky consistency and made me look like a ghost.,1
2,"I have sensitive skin and adult acne, so I was hoping this product would do the trick since tea tree oil has always soothed my skin when it's dry. After reading so many good reviews, I decided to buy it.<br /><br />When I first put it on, everywhere it touched felt like it was on fire. The next day, the path I had rolled with it was bright red and slightly raised. It took a few days for the redness/swelling to go down. I tried it again a week later with the same results. I'm pretty sure it's the willow bark, which is where salicylic acid is derived. Every redness reducing product I've ever tried that contains salicylic acid just makes my face worse - red, burning, dry, and itchy. If you've experience the same sensitivity to willow bark/salicylic acid, skip this product. I've read that sensitivity to salicylic acid is uncommon though, so if your skin isn't overly sensitive like mine is, I'd say give this a shot. Usually Burt's Bees is good to me, so I think this one is just a fluke because of the salicylic acid.",1
2,"I purchased the maxi-peel from a seller to sent me the product ruined. It was a very dark brown burned color. That really made me mad because I was so eager to try it. The maxi peel should be a light yellow color. So now I have to send it back and buy it from a different seller. Also I dont believe to use the solo one hand pressure sprayer is good for the maxipeel. I think you should get the a cheap pray bottle from your beauty supply store or a perfume bottle. The solo sprayer comes out kind of in a heavy spray and will use up the solution much quicker, plus you can just buy the cheaper smaller plastic bottle for like .99 cents. I will post a review once I get my 2nd order of maxi peel in the mail.",1

I guess I should have noticed that the description said 6 grams!  I thought I was purchasing the full size compact as shown in the picture and would not have paid the price I paid had I realized this was the mini.  Beware of purchasing from this seller because as I stated earlier, this photo is of the full size eye shadow compact and not the mini that is for sale.  Very disappointing.  Good grief!!",1

2,low quality varnish - in some debris that spoils when apply varnish,1
2,This product is okay. But I think it is way overpriced.  I got it for the cotton pads but didn't realize it had an opening in the front.  For half the price of this plastic one I got a couple of nice glass containers from the container store for the rest of my bathroom needs.  The lid is very hard to put back on once off.  Other than that it serves its purpose.,1
1,Like many other reviewers I was hoping it would would work out. Just wanted something to keep my face matte since I don't wear make up and it tends to get shiny.<br />My face broke out almost immediately. I don't have sensitive skin so I was mortified not being able to cover it up. I think it may be old or something. Don't know much about makeup to say that it is.<br />A loss for me!,1

NOT IMPRESSED with the product at all!",1
2,"The product is okay. Not amazing... Not something I want to use all the time, just when I need to.",1
2,Love the product but the product doesnt love me. I have been using it for a couple of weeks and everytime I put it on it will not hold to my package. I am about 7 1/2 but it either gives me an uncontrollable erection or I have to put it on so tight that it continues to slip off with the slightest movement. I have to be still and not walk for me to get the effect of the product. Don't know if it's the product or me but either way I feel it would work if they invent better grip support. I am going to try and tough it out because 9 is my goal but 10 is even better. Any suggestions?,1
2,My hair feels dry and like straw when I used this product.  I will not re-order it again.  Only reason that I have given it two stars instead of 1 is that my boyfriend likes it.  So not a complete waste of money.,1

She came home with the hair in three large mats that were unable to be detangled. We had to spend another $200.00 to get micro braids put in with Expression extensions (a very good product). The Zury Company was completely unresponsive to my emails. Classy Wigs of Covington, LA would not give me a refund either because they could not believe that one swim completely destroyed the Zury hair. But I am telling the truth - Don't waste your money!

1,Doesn't really work.  I use this because my hair is very oily in the morning if I haven't had a chance to shower yet.  I bought this to buy me some time before I shower if I ever have to run to the store or something.  The smell in this shampoo is good but very over-powering.  And it makes my hair SOOO dry when I go to wash it next.  It is notty and hard to brush.  And it really doesn't even work to make my hair look less oily.  Will never buy this again and do not recommend it.,1

But then I looked at some of the &#34;ingredients&#34; on my bottle and it didn't seem to be entirely free of &#34;sulfates&#34; than the traditional sodium lauryl sulfate/sulfate Shampoos. As a vegetarian I was expecting herbs not sodium cocoyl sulfate, cocamidopropyl betaine, sodium cocoyl sarcosinate and other high concentrations of Hair Conditioning Agents, Deodorant Agents, Surfactants, and Cleansing Agents.<br /><br />Ingredients: Purified water, organic aloe barbadensis leaf juice (1), sodium cocoyl sulfate, cocamidopropyl betaine, sodium cocoyl sarcosinate, vegetable glycerin, serenoa serrulata (saw palmetto) fruit extract, panthenol (pro-vitamin B-5), biotin, thiamine, pyridoxine, niacin, riboflavin, polyquaternium-10, wheat protein, soy protein, citric acid, soyamidopropalkonium chloride, jojoba oil, organic helianthus annuus (sunflower) oil (2), sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, ethylhexylglycerin, organic rosamarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf oil (2), and other essential oils. (1) Certified by BioAgriCert (2) Certified by Quality Assurance International<br /><br />According to the journal Contact Dermatitis, the following ingredients were said to display &#34;similar&#34; signs of irritation to 2% sodium lauryl sulfate:<br /><br />5% sodium C12-15 pareth sulfate<br />5% sodium cocoyl isethionate<br />10% disodium laureth sulfosuccinate<br />10% sodium cocoamphoacetate<br />10% cocamide DEA<br />10% cocamidopropyl betaine<br />10% lauryl glucoside",1
2.0,Haven't even been able to use the product yet due to the stopper not even fitting the bottle.  Had to wait for an order of additional supplies so that I could dispense this properly.  Anyone that even glanced at this bottle would be able to see that the stopper just 'rests' on the top...sticking 1/4in out of the top of the bottle.,1
1,"I purchased this product to remove facial hair. Does it work? Well, it does remove facial hair. But not like I expected. It really doesn't take off much hair.i wouldn't recommend this .",1
2,"I mean it´s ok. Someone else said that the rubber on the handle gets caught up in the hair and pulls it, it´s true. I don´t like that.<br />Also, I bought this because I thought the bristles wouldn´t melt. They totally melt, maybe less than other brushes, but they melt and my hair smells like it´s burnt.<br />Not very good for the price, quite dissapointed.",1
1,"I bought a couple packs last week, but I don't plan on using anymore. I have never really had skin problems, but I do get some black heads on my nose. It did pull a couple of them out when I used it, but a few days later I broke out really bad on my nose. Considering I've only broken out a couple times in my 26 years, I'm guessing it was caused from these. I would suggest an at-home remedy or a different brand with less chemicals. Having a few black heads is better than a bunch of pimples/zits on your nose, trust me!",1
1,"The comb seems fine so far but is made in India.  The Amazon description says made in Switzerland, but when it arrived it had a big sticker on it saying MADE IN INDIA.  False advertising, so I am giving it one star.",1
2,"The color is not cute at all. I use this at home on the weekends so that nobody has to see it on my lips. I can't just throw it out because I paid for it, and yeah the color is gross but it's still the Baby Lips formula so it's still a nice lip balm.",1
2,For an expensive candle I was completely underwhelmed by the fragrance. Perhaps it is the clementine scent as I have enjoyed other Decker candle scents with satisfaction.,1
2,I kinda liked this for the hold the smell and the brightness that gives to your hair but once you try to remove it ITS IMPOSSIBLE i spent almost a week trying to wash it down but it would only get worse it would get solid and look so bad if you wanna take toe chance try it,1
2,I love nars and their products but i hadnt seen this in person and i was hoping it was going to be more pink on the skin with a matte finish but it translates as a very light pink heavier on the shimmer and glitter. I have olive/tan skin.,1
1,"So disappointing. I guess this was just wrong for my hair - I have fine long hair. It felt like my hair was covered in film, no matter how much I rinsed it.",1
2,This product has great conditioner and all but if you keep it in even a little bit longer it will be MUCH darker then what its suppose to be.,1
1,I received different design,1
2,Spray bottle did not work well.<br />Stopped up and difficult to apply<br />Lots of waste<br />I will not purchase again,1
2,This is called perfect match and has &#34;dual set&#34; for a reason...there is TWO! Why did I ONLY get the gel polish? I guess you live and learn!,1
1,Do not buy if you are looking for a closed top cap.  It is open and it is flimsy.,1
1.0,Does not stay on longer than one day,1
2,saw no improvement so once again save your money,1
1.0,"Very disappointed. I don't even want to give it one star. It deserves a quarter of a star, and it's only because of the cool design on the bottle!!<br />I am an avid indoor tanner, and have used all sorts of different lotions. My best tans are with accelerators. I seen so many positive reviews for this lotion that I thought for the price you can't go wrong. Boy was I wrong! I'm not sure if the actual tanning lotion was replaced with moisturizing lotion that you would use for when you have dry skin or what, because there is no tingle what so ever, and I don't even tan !!!! No color at all!!!!! I Will defiantly not buy this lotion again, nor buy from this seller.",1
1,"I've been using a shavette for years, so when this promotion came up I wasn't actually all that interested.  At any rate I figured I'd try it since some times I shave my head (yay summer!).  In short: this razor is pretty terrible, clogging all the time and just giving an overall unsatisfactory shave.  I don't understand the point of the vibration feature and seems extremely more trouble than it's worth.  Add in the expense and I just see no reason to use this razor.  I wound up giving the handle to my brother, he may use it at some point, but overall I can't recommend this razor to anyone and have a hard time bringing it up other than to wonder why the heck it exists.",1
2,didn't realize these were missing some sort of tool to put them in your hair....haven't ordered it. So don't know how they work,1
2,"EXTREMELY hard to see what you are doing, it covers your whole eye, it works a little but absolutely not worth it. I could have done the same thing freehand.<br /><br />Probably going to throw this out or give it to someone...if I can find anyone who wants it<br /><br />Not worth it, would not recommend.",1
2,"I guess it works, but takes too long to use to get all the hair. It took a whole month to get it in the mail.",1
1.0,Smells awful! I tried to use it but could not get over the rancid smell.,1
1,Looked like denim but they're elastic shorts.,1
2.0,"The white one will glow in the tube, the yellow one a tiny bit the other colors don't glow at all. I did manage to get it to glow by taking the tube apart so more could be taken out but it takes about half a tube applied over a base to get it to glow in blacklight.",1
1,The stamper I ordered doesn't look anything like the one I received.,1
1,As I am not the only one that recieved Addict when I ordered Addict 2 for my wife.  You would think that Sephora would look into the problem to see where the disconnect is!  They never responded to either of my attempts to rectify the issue.<br />Thankfully Amazon takes care of their customers via A-Z guarantee.<br />Thanks Amazon!,1
1,the scent doesn't last all day like other Jason products. Even my wife didn't like it. Not the best or what i come to expect from the Jason brand,1
1,"You know I've always wanted to look like an alien.  What a perfect idea invisanips!!  Now I can hide my shameful nipples from the world.  Put them on and wore them trouble is I forgot about them.

1,Great product that i have been using for years. Unfortunately  this bottle was old or something as it smelled terribly of mildew when wet. I have returned it for a refund.,1
1,"I jumped for joy and didn't believe the clear skin reflecting back at me in the mirror the next morning after the very first time I used the product. It was amazing. Then a few days later....pimples were back with angry vengeance, and the more I used it, the worse they got. There must be something in it that certain skin types can become immune to over time, for me, rather quickly. If you have mild acne, I'm sure it will work for you, but if you have bad acne, you'll be up a creek.",1
1,I have been using this product for years and have in the past been happy with it. But this order is runny.  It looks watered down.  I have to use twice as much as I have been. I am not happy.,1
2,I love the product. Found it for less then half the price at Whole Foods... That was very disappointing.,1
1,Too bad this product did not work at all.  I returned it and they refunded my money right away so the effort was worthwhile overall.  Had to find out what works and what doesn't.,1
1,"It did not work well at all. It feels like water. Also after using it, still left the polish on. Very poor quality and very disappointing.",1
2.0,Too grease,1
1,"I've used many dry shampoos and I know what a good one can do so this was just not want I was expecting. I've read many reviews trying to find a good one but there are so many mixed reviews that I'm left wondering if they are even reviewing the same product?! So in order for this review to be helpful I have to mention what I am expecting and what this product did because ultimately that is what would help me find the product I need.<br /><br />What I expect and need: I have long hair and don't want to wash my hair in 2 days when it gets a little greasy at the roots. So I need a product that does a good job at making hair look clean, by taking away the oiliness.  A little white residue doesn't bother me, I can work with that. My primary need is to be clean-looking, not necessarily more volume, although sometimes that's an added bonus.<br /><br />What this product did: Absolutely nothing except to add more oiliness to it?! I don't know why but when shook the can very well and sprayed at the roots and my hair came out flat and even more greasy than when I started. There was no powdery substance to it, it felt slick to the touch, my hands came away with a shininess to them when touching my roots and my hair was limp and gross. Maybe this product works for volume when hair is cleaner? That's the only way I can think why some people have positive reviews.",1
1.0,"This arrived on time and looked great.  This was to be the center broach on a bridesmaid dress. The bridal party got dressed and we were all set to go. Someone noticed that the broach had come unfastened before we even left the house. It was re-adjusted and we left. Once we left for the church things were very busy. The broach fell off at some point shortly after the ceremony. I thought it was lost forever. Just recently the bride returned it to me, said the reception hall people gave it to her. Now it is too late to return it, and the pin part is broke off so I cannot use it again. Very pretty but extremely poor quality for the price. Extremely disappointed.",1
1,"This product does not do what it is advertised to do. I actually had to order something different. This product is not worth the money and frankly, I could have just purchased a moisturizer. I was not at all impressed. I went back to using  Reviva Labs Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Ampules. I have used the Ampules in the past and had noticed a huge difference as did friends and family. I will stick with that instead! What a waste of money Perlabella was. I assumed this product was 100% Hyaluronic Acid, boy was I wrong. You will note the difference if you have used the actual acid.uggg!",1
2,"I think this is effective as a supplement to flossing, but not as replacement. I think this may depeend on your teeth. I easily get things stuck in my teeth. I'm sure this is cleening under the gums better, but it can't dislodge everything. If you're looking for a replacement for flossing, probably not the way to go, but again, it may depend on your teeth.",1
2,not as good as you claim it was.  does not shave as close as I would like. I would not recommend it.,1
1,"Ehh, I never tried anything like this before and it turned out to just be something that smells ok and makes my beard bushy. just sits in my drawer now.",1
1,THE SCREEN ON THIS PRODUCT IS TRASH IT DID NOT LAST ONE WEEK I AM VERRY DISSATIFED WITH THIS .THANK YOU LARRY LUTINSKI,1
1,I intending to use this razor as a reintroduction to shaving with a safety razor at a low price.  Low price in this case also represented low quality. The head of the shaver was broken from the handle before arrival.  Not worth the time or effort to request a replacement for a $2 piece of plastic wrapped in some &#34;metal&#34; like substance and wait another 4-6 weeks to receive.  The accompanying razor was of equally poor quality when used for less than 10 seconds in my Edwin Jagger DE89 which I had ordered later and which arrived much sooner. All parts and pieces of the broken shaver made a quick journey to the trash can.,1
1.0,This smells so much worse than normal nail polish. The bristles for the tip are coarse which leaves it uneven and leaves streak marks. It clumps really fast. So unless your using it just for dots and quick touch ups over already white nails don't waste your money. Get normal nail polish or just try something else... anything else.,1
1,I would've given it 5 stars but they sent  me the wrong product. I ordered these because it seemed like a colorful set from the description but when I opened the package it was the silver moon rhinestone set in different designs but all the same color. Disappointed.,1
1,"DO NOT BUY THE TRUE CERAMIC PRO! It is not truely ceramic! Mine broke after only 9 months, which is probably why it only has a six month warrabty. The first iron they sent me stopped working after two days, and the second they sent to me had chipped plates, and the third stopped working after only 9 months and the painted on plate coating chipped off VERY quickly to reveal METAL plates, NOT CERAMIC! I regret buying mine, it was not worth the money. The quality does not match the expensive price. This item should be priced at $1.00 for its quality. SCAM!  <br />",1
1,I didn't see cell renewal.  I saw drying and skin eruptions.  Too harsh. I would not recommend it. I like Dr. Gross  Alpha Beta Peel treatments better.,1
1,"If you look in the second photo (smiley face) there is a UV light or something used. This may be why everyone says it doesn't glow. Also it only comes in blue, orange, yellow, and green, which is shown in one photo. This is highly sexual packaging, and a very small quantity of gooey thick stuff (not really paint).  Do not buy.",1
1,This deodorant is not natural! Contains Propylene Glycol which is a chemical and is actually under investigation..,1
2,"Well, '40 pairs' means 20 pairs to these people. And the eyelashes shown are not the ones you will get. The quality is okay, but seriously, what false advertising.",1
2,"Very poor hair extensions. If you're thinking about buying them, buy them with no intention of ever dyeing, straightening, or curling them. I've been wearing them about 3 weeks and they're already fried. I'm highly disappointed. :c Waste of my time and money.",1
1,Thick and ineffectual.,1
1,"Don't make the mistake that I made. Don't purchase this product if you are thinking it will be a healthy, natural skin scrub. Read the ingredients listed below this cheaply made &#34;natural&#34; product before purchasing. Make sure you're ok with Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and the other carcinogenic garbage that they somehow pass off as &#34;natural.&#34;<br /><br />I bought it because it was an add-on product and seemed to be a very fair price as far as a natural skin scrub. Well, as soon as I received the bottle, I realized why it's so cheap. This petrochemical product was a waste of my money and time.",1
1,This is the worst electric razor I have ever used.  It doesn't come close to giving me a good shave and I've tried using it dry and wet.  I have to go over the same spot seven times before it is even remotely close to a razor shave and takes five times as long to shave.  Even after I shave my face raw I still have to get out a razor if I want a good shave.  Wish I had never bought it.,1
2,"The specs above say: Heats to maximum temperature swiftly and remains constant throughout use^Temperature gauge offers ranges from 140° f to 410° f^Swivel cord prevents tangling^Sleek, ergonomic design with non-slip grip^110-120 volts, 60hz<br /><br />But there is no temperature gauge. It's just on or off. And the cord is fixed, not swivel. I would have been happy if the product i received had the specs listed. This is not what i ordered.",1
1,this color is way too light and to get the white-ish color you have to have 3 coats. The seller is the BESTS (not the first time I order from them) but THIS particularly nail polish is not great... I'll just stay with Opi &lt;3,1
1,I feel totally ripped off. The tubes of massca,1
2,"I'd used a Braun foil shaver for many years, but grew tired of having to purchase their clean and renew refills every month.  Thought I'd give the Norelco a try.  My expectations were high for this shaver, given the numerous favorable reviews here and the amount of money I paid for it (even though Amazon's price point is pretty darned competitive).  After using the Norelco for three months, I've ordered a new, top-of-the-line Braun shaver.  I shave every day - and shave my face and entire head (given that the hair on the very top of my head is long gone) and this shaver hasn't lived up to expectations.  If there's a few days growth (e.g., shaving on Sunday in preparation for work on Monday), the shaving process takes an inordinately long period of time, as areas have to be shaved over - and over - and over again before the closeness of the shave is anywhere near acceptable.  The shaver's pop-up trimmer is a joke.  It barely protrudes when extended and is positioned in such a way so that the shaver's three shaving heads obstruct your view of the trimmer (and what you're attempting to trim).  It's a sharp-looking shaver, but that's about the only positive I can mention.",1
1.0,"We have other superhero toothbrushes. We bought this one because are son wanted a Batman toothbrush. I'm really sorry that I bought this toothbrush, it is really cheaply made and the bristles do not move the only thing that vibrates is the handel.",1

1,"Unfortunately, I ordered the wrong item.  It is also Nioxin Therapy but not the conditioner.",1
2,Not sure that it is working that much.  Don't care for the smell at all.  Wish it had more of the pomogrante smell to it. Probably will give it away.,1
2,"I bought this item after using another Hot Tools flat iron for many years. I loved that product and wanted the exact same, which is what I thought I had here, since it's the same product number. Not so. this product is designed differently with a completely different dial for the temp, and the handle is also different. The first one I had made straightening easy, while this new one is HORRIBLE. I actually have to take a rest half way through using it because my wrist starts to hurt so much. I don't know what it is that they've done differently but I am extremely disappointed and wish I hadn't bought this now.",1
1,It's very messy and it doesn't work at all! don't waste your money!! pls don't purchase this piece of junk!!!,1
2,"I am over 50 and have a few minor wrinkles near my eyes and around my lips.

KMS Had an EXCELLENT Leave-In conditioner called LIQIUD ASSETS(tm) (Later: DAILY REPAIR / DAILY FIXX) Which was the BEST, MOST EFFECTIVE, leave-in treatment I have ever used. It was SUPER LIGHTWEIGHT and REALLY WORKED (Guess that's why they discontinued it) The current batch of Leave-Ins from KMS are TERRIBLE!! there's not one that does not contain silicone, herbals or some other objectionable ingredient, not to mention the fragrance(s) which I can't stand. The herbals in the formulas give me a headache and a rash on my scalp, neck, chest and anywhere else they touch so, obviously, I am not going to be using them again which is a shame since I have been buying them since the late 1970's when they had great formulas and yummy fruit fragrances.",1
2,I was disappointed in the shade of.green. I thought I would be getting a darker green but.....no! It Is really more of a teal. I would never order this again.,1
1,Order two packs if you plan on doing both hands like a normal person.<br />For the price i think this product is outrageous!,1
1,Smells like redhots not true cinnamon. And since it is called cinnamon BARK it shouldn't smell like such an artificial byproduct.,1
1,"Some people just have no clue about this product because EVEN THOUGH FAKE, it still works like a hair straightener, just not fantastic results like the real one. What's that you say, you like the results? Now imagine how much better results the real one would give you. Please hear me out.<br /><br />So my wife's REAL one I paid $300 for died after 4 years. No way was I spending $300 for a new one so I found one on Amazon for $40 figuring they dropped in price online since 4 years ago. Well. This is NOT REAL. The plates are way off and way small, they're risen instead of indented, they pull hair, the screws are stripped metal screws not those black triangle screws like on the real one there was a gold passed sticker on it and a bogus warranty card in the box as well. (The real box has the choose your fashion label on the back in black, not white and Le, Ni, Dv, Tp 1.75 and 440 are all on the back as well almost looking like a bio chart) I sent it back right away. Those who love this product obviously don't know what the real ones feel and look like and therefore because this is a hair straightener, it will work to some extent. However it won't give you results the real one gives you and will probably break in less than a month. I question the plates even being metal, let alone tourmaline or titanium, I bet its synthesized metal created in a lab somewhere in china. How there are 17 left right now is beyond me. All that says to me is if they had 100 then 83 people who never had a herstlyer before just got ripped off and if they end up hating their herstyler now I feel bad for the negative comments the real company would get because some people are just blind to fake products like this. I contacted amazon and they've removed the one I purchased already, I'd assume this one would be next but with so many listings they may not get to this one. Just try not to be one of the next 17 people from the 17 left that get ripped off. If you want to spend $40 on one then go to WalMart and by their brand styler, unless you love the look of this one, then buy this one cause that's all your $40 will end up going to is the look and maybe the cord for the plug, at least that part was real. Fakers go home. I'll take my chances on the real one for $300. I now see why they're $200~$300, but you can find them for $100~$180 depending on the model you want elsewhere. trust me, if you ladies know and love your hair and want a herstyler like my wife had gotten attached to hers, she couldn't use another one and she knew the difference right away, but then when I examined it I felt so burned that Amazon could let such a fake product slip through the cracks like this. I'll 2nd guess some of my purchases from Amazon from now on.<br /><br />P.S. For awhile now I have been shopping on Amazon wondering why some of the products I was looking at were cheaper brand new than some used things on ebay. Now I see why and how easy factories in China manufacture products so close to the original product it's crazy and for some people who have no clue, it's those people who keep those factories making products and money. I also see now that patents are created not only so someone doesn't make money off of someone else's product, but because people put in so much time inventing something for a reason, and this hair straightener proves that statement completely. The real ones were invented to do what regular hair straighteners can't do, and my wife could curl her hair with her straightener and now she can curve it a bit with the fake one and it doesn't hold long at all. So shame on this hunk of garbage. Lastly also, I shouldn't be expected to just know a product is fake because the price is low, because it's not like I mind buying fake products to begin with, it's just thinking you bought something real and finding out it's fake kind of strips you of your dignity, which is exactly how I felt and why I'm venting in this review right now, please forgive me. Just don't buy this crap, go to cvs and buy a regular one off the shelf if you wanna spend $40, at least you know it's what it says it is on the box. Unlike the crap I just bought was probably tin and created in china to look like metal. Fakers, invent something real and manufacture that.",1

So, the coverage is barely and while it does moisturize it left my face looking like I'd dipped it in oil, even the normally dry parts.  I applied powder which toned the shiny down but after wearing it for a couple of months, I developed blackheads all over that exfoliating doesn't touch.  Long story short...if you have large pores, areas that need coverage, or the need to not look like an oil slick, this is not the product for you.",1
2,"I can't really finish my review on this product because it dried my skin out SO BAD that I had to stop using it.

For my particular face, which loved the Feathers with nary a nick, the Astra blades were too rough.  They nicked me every time I used them.

1,"I am an avid user of Biolage now for over 5 years-my stylist uses the hair color and highlights, I use all the styling products, shampoo and conditioners. I have the entire line. I wouldn't use anything else on my hair ever again! Everything I have used of Biolage is the best. I double process every 8 weeks, and my stylist was very reluctant to do so to me. But with the Biolage systems, I was able to pull it off, and no one is the wiser. My hair is always soft, silky, and very manageable.

I thought that this product was the same as the small glass bottles of ceramide conditioner I had been using, and that the company had changed the packaging. Either it isn't, or they have changed the formula. This was thick, almost exactly like my usual Biolage hair conditioner. After I used it and got out of the shower and dried my hair, I ended up going back into the shower and using my regular Biolage conditioner. It was a waste of my money, water, and time. It will go into the donation bin on the next run to charity.",1
2,"Amazon did not have a record of this being shipped to me.  Since it came from Australia, I did not know how to return it.  It arrived in a jar that was badly broken and spilled.  I am using what is left of the cream but will not reorder.  Also, the shipping and handling is quite expensive.",1

2,"I think the reviews are rigged SOME HOW. I needed a new flat iron, I was going to buy one likemy old one but bought this flat iron because of the reviews and it's.... not what I expected. Hair feels frizzy, my other flat iron didn't give me that problem. Disappointed.",1
2.0,"This product seemed really neat I thought I finally found a solution to unwanted hair without all the chemicals and hot wax. But after using this product once, the area I used it on broke out in tiny little pimples! It didn't really hurt that bad but my face was irritated for two weeks. Needless to say I haven't used it since.",1
1,"Worthless. Tip retracts so easily that tip doesn't reach root, so just destroys skin and leaves root intact. Complete waste of money.",1
1,"This is another one of those products where I really wanted to like it and, unfortunately, it didn't work out.  This review is for the color \\""Silk Sheets,\\"" since multiple products are listed on this page.<br /><br />The main attraction for this polish was that it would change colors.  I realize that it's the middle of winter and I don't necessarily expect it to change colors outside when it's dark and overcast.  But I put my hand about 2 inches in front of a full-spectrum (including UV) lamp in my tortoise's cage and even after 5 minutes, it still didn't change colors.  Unfortunately, I don't really care for the default color -- it's a weird peachy color that doesn't look good with my skin.  (If you had dark skin and there was some contrast between your skin color and the polish, I think it would be a lovely color.  But I'm very pale and it's not flattering on me.)<br /><br />The other problem I have with this is that it doesn't perform very well as polish.  I used a good base coat and a quick-dry topcoat, and it felt dry to the touch after a few minutes.  However, less than an hour later, one fingernail was already messed up (by contrast, Julep, OPI, Essie, Zoya, etc., don't do this).  By the next day, I had weird scratches and pits in the surface of a couple of nails, something I've never seen with other brands of polish.  I also have a few chips, though chipping is not terrible.  I should also point out that I used three coats and there are still places this looks a little streaky.<br /><br />So, in the end, it was a fun idea to try, but it really didn't work.  I'll give it one more shot as summer polish on my toes, but I won't be buying any other colors.",1

1,Broke my face out BAD!!  I would not recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin or acne prone skin.  I would steer clear of this product.,1
2,bought this for my son the first 3 weeks he was bitting his nail but after that the taste was nothing to him so he will bight them anyways with them painted ....,1
1,Would not buy this kind did not like maybe other wen products are good but this one not good just dii with this one my try another kind,1
2,I took this out of the envelope to see how cheap it is. I tried putting it on and it kept pulling my hair. It's hard to put on as well.,1
1,"I ordered this after using another well know lash serum because it has such great reviews. Unfortunately, I did not experience anything great from using this product.  It gave me red itchy and puffy eyes the first week of use, but I continued using it expecting results.  The redness did go away after a week  so I continued use, however after almost two months my lashes have not grown at all and I have been using it religiously 2x a day.  I have thrown this out and have gone back to the lash serum I used before I have only been using it for a week and my lashes look amazing. I wish I could say the same for this product because I had such high hopes.",1
2,"This product did have an odor, although not as bad as most self-tanners.  The color was also a bit orange on dark skin.",1
1,"I bought this product thinking it was the one with white peach and a blend of silk blossom,but the one I received was white peach and orange blossom.There is a difference in the scent between the two.The one I regularly use is a lighter scent which does not bother my allergies and asthma.The one with the orange blossom is a stronger scent.Anyone buying this product thinking it is the lighter scented one beware because I found out that the manufacturer put the same bar code with the same numbers on both scents,so if you are wanting the one with a blend of silk blossom and think that is what you will get you will have to call to ask about it to order.No ones fault,but the manufacturers.",1
1,I had to add a second wig to thicken this wig. I could see the cap before I even got the chance to put it on.,1
1,I really hate it. I just received the items but not exactly the same in what you see in the picture and no box.,1
1,"Gave 1 star only because there is no zero option. Fantastic unbelievable product but unless you purchase from a Nerium Brand Partner there is NO money back guarantee, no guarantee that the bottle has already been sampled and no opportunity to recieve the product for free or become a Brand Partner.",1
1,Product arrived broken and leaking out of container,1
2,Like the gel. Doesn't seem that fibers are really coming off that much...,1
1,I got the wrong color 😱,1
1,"It's just a loofa tied to a wooden stick with a flimsy string.  It would be the same if you bought a loofa, took a wooden stick, drilled two holes at the end and tied the loofa to it.  After a couple weeks the loofa doesn't stay in place on the end of the stick and keeps moving around so it is impossible to scrub your back with it.  I ended up just cutting off the loofa and using the loofa by itself.  I bought a much much better back scrubbing brush from Target for $3.99 which has a rectangular shaped loofa firmly attached to both sides of the end of the handle.",1
2,For the price I was expecting more.  After just a few uses the whitening got progressively worse.  I could still use for another couple of months but overall I  was not impressed.,1
1,"I have extremely platinum hair very close to white/silver that I'd recently toned with Wella t18, but the ends still looked brassy, so I tried using this. It did absolutely nothing and it smells awful, like miracle whip. Would not recommend.",1
1,Very poorly.. The aroma was weak and does not last .. Was this an out of date product .. I would have returned it but threw all packaging away .. May have to stop ordering from amazon for products such as this .. I have  tested this at other places such as Macy's and strong as it should have been  I don't like returning things so I jus figured I lost 48.00 as of this time. Poor business practice on perfumes,1
2,Took forever to get it. Other then that I loved them. The look really nice and people actually thought i dyed my hair,1
1,I FOUND THE RAZOR EVERYTHING I EXPECTED WHICH WAS EXCELLENT.  GOOD RAZOR THAT DOES A FINE JOB AS IT IS USED CORRECTLY.,1
1,DOes not work by evening I am stinking!  It may do the job for someone that does not sweat much but it did not do the job for me. I would not recommend.  For all natural deodorant try Alvera brand it really does work well.,1
1.0,"I have to be honest here - it came to me and the bottle was not sealed. I thought that to be odd, but said, whatever let's try it. It smells VERY strongly of patchouli and nothing else. I also thought this was odd. When trying to open the bottle, the top gets stuck to the dropper, almost as if the dropper was removed and something else put in it's place. I found all of this suspicious, but thought I was possibly wrong. Today I happened to be in a Whole Foods and saw this on their shelf and I tested out the scent. It smells NOTHING like what I was sent. It had the nuances of the essential oils listed in it and it was subtle and nice. What I have is only Patchouli, which I HATE and I have to think that I was charged for a bottle of Aura Cacia Tranquility and what I received was cheap patchouli oil that was placed into the bottle by someone. Not happy and I am throwing out the bottle today. Buyer beware.",1
2,Doesn't make any real lather. It's a shame. Better off with a girly loofa/puff that will actually work than this 'thing' that looks like it would be good for guys but doesn't perform the task it was intended to do.,1
1,"burt its self out 2min after turnin it on! you prob get what you pay for with toys like these, cheaply made.",1
2.0,"Unfortunately the package came with 12 bottles but only 10 sprayers. Otherwise, seems like a great product but now I have to purchase 2 individual sprayers. Frustrating.",1
1,"I don't know what the big deal is worth this liquid pore strips.  I used it as directed on the packaging but I only saw a few whiteheads and blackheads when I peeled it off. I don't know if I pout too thinly but out was a good amount that I applied.  One thing it did do, when I touched my nose after it was less rough,  the bumping was gone.  It was smoother. If the rave reviewers can tell more how they did it,  out would be nice.  They made it sound like this things sucked out ALL the blackheads and whiteheads out but that wasn't the same for me.",1
1,"For a product this expensive, I would expect better quality than what I received. This straightener has a horrible design, with the control buttons on the outside. This creates high pitched beeping noises every time you grip it. It makes the whole straightening process frustrating. On top of that, the grips don't give a very tight hold to straighten the hair, so it easily slips between the plates. There are other straighteners on the market for about the same price that are much better than this one (CHI, Sedu, etc.). I bought this one thinking I could replace my CHI (which was amazing), but alas, this one seems pretty useless.<br />I strongly recommend looking elsewhere if you need a high-quality, professional grade hair straightener because this one doesn't cut it.",1
2,"this was recommended to me and i read and saw so many reviews on it but it just didn't work for me, and i've gone through more than half the bottle. it smells amazing! but I felt as if it dried out my hair. way to expensive for such a little product",1
1,No it does not have much scent. Would like to return. Not sure how.,1
1,"No effect except to feel a tightness on the area applied. Left crusty residue, no matter how little or much used.",1
1,"I have owned other Panasonic nose, ear and facial hair trimmers that worked well. This top of the line trimmer simply does not cut ear hair Basically useless. Unfortunately the return window has expired.",1
1,"Came in the mail faster then expected, but the formula seems to think for my airbrush machine....it clogs it up whenever I try to use it and it gets me extremely aggrevated because then I have to stop and take it apart&#62;:(",1
2,Meh... Didn't notice any results.,1
1,Was so excited to received this pallete and never ended up getting anything in the mail.,1
1,Doesn't apply easily and leaves streaks if you use the roller itself. Wouldn't recommend item and would not purchase again,1
1,After reading reviews I thought for sure I found the perfect set of wodden baby brushes. BUT when I took them out of the package dozens and dozens of bristles fell right out. That can't be safe for use on a infant.,1
1,"I bought this product and didn't have a chance to use it right away, since it arrived when I was out of town. When I got back I followed the instructions and used it regularly, but all it did was burn the hair. I had to cover every inch at least 10 times before it would even scorch the hairs. It left my legs stubbly and prickly. Then two days later the hair was back. The battery runs down every time I finish my legs and the charger is not small. It is bulky. The disks that come with it are sandpaper for your skin. Not sure what that is supposed to do. It does not make anything smooth. I contacted NoNo and they refused to take it back, since the 60 days had past. They did send me another one with the same disappointing results. Now I have a useless expensive gadget that I can't use or get rid of. Say NoNo to NoNo and save your money!",1
1,"I don't like giving poor reviews but unfortunately I can't rate this product well. I used it twice a day for 6 weeks and not only did it not lighten whatsoever, but my brown spots look much darker when using this, and it doesn't provide sufficient moisturizer to apply foundation over.",1
1,"I hate to give a product one star, but this scrub was simply bad. It doesn't do anything that the description says it will, not even remotely. It does have the texture of a scrub, but that is about it. I didn't notice any change in how much shine appeared on my skin, nor did my skin feel any \\""deep clean.\\"" In fact, I felt that I had a film on top of my face, so I had to wash my face again to get rid of that. I even felt like my skin had more shine and oil the week that I used this product. I've tried other products of their Deep Clean line, and they were better by far. This product just doesn't deliver.",1
2,"I bought this in my ongoing quest to find a permanent solution for my KP. Long story short, I haven't seen any results. It hasn't made my KP worse, which gets a star in my book, but I have seen no positive changes. I have used it for about a month so I will reevaluate after i finish the bottle, but as it stands now - this will not be repurchased.",1
1,I'm not a picky person and will usually try anything.  This stuff smells awful!  I had to throw mine away because it made me nauseous!  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.,1
1,Well.... I waited 3 months and they won't give me my money back. This was a bad shopping experience.  I was robbed.  Enough said.,1
1,"Like so many others have said, the formula has changed. The unforgettable fragrance (which hooked me and probably everyone else in the first place is gone). What happened?!?!? Why would I buy this?",1
1,"This hair was by far the worst hair ever. It arrived in good timing but I ordered the 3 piece and received a 4 piece. None of the lengths were even close to a 16 or 18!!! They were so light in weight. Couldn't, have even been close to 2.5 oz. The longest of the 4 wasn't the right type of hair. It looked to be a loose wave and not a body wave which I ordered. It had a corn like smell to it. I let it \\""air\\""out for a few days before having it installed. There was no way of me contacting the seller. I put it in on Oct. 3rd and will be taking out tonight. Ive had too many issues with it. It sheds like crazy , tangles, and curl wouldn't come back after washing. I'm so pissed. I war everyone to not purchase this hair. All the good reviews are fake. Waste of money. They don't deserve the 1 star I gave, but Amazon required a ratinh",1
2,"In my experience, this bottle does little to keep bugs at bay. Maybe the mosquitoes where I live have different tastes. When I head outside, I can see the bugs swarming around, scoping out the situation from afar. They're saying: &#34;Stinky? Yeah. Dangerous? No. Delicious? Definitely!&#34;<br /><br />I spritzed on a generous amount 15 minutes ago and I'm counting 4 bites right now. I appreciate the ingredient list, but it didn't do the trick for me.",1
2,cheap looking,1
2,These don't really get under my nails--the bristles are too long and soft--but they are good for general hand cleaning.,1
1,"This worked for about 3 months then would not light up and even when it did light up it was very lacking and could not shave by this light alone, also started fogging up the 3rd week.  I would not recommend this.",1
2,The brushes work fine except when the metal tip came off of the black part of the handle. I was in the middle of practicing on my friends nails when it just fell off! It would have been embarrasing if I were to have purchased these for a more professional use.. Nevertheless I had some super glue handy and I was able to glue the tip back on.,1
1,"Especially after reading these reviews this looks like a waste of money.    After my Sonic toothbrush started smelling skanky, I replaced the head, then after using it in the miorning I disassemble it and let it dry -- no more mold.",1
2.0,"Apparently you can't insert pictures because I took one for you to advise how big/wide this barrel actually is before you buy it.<br />The description and box say it is a 2\\"" barrel, however, it is closer to a 1\\"" than 1+1/4\\"" even. Nowhere near 1.5 inches at least, if it were I would have kept it... I put a ruler against it and it measured at 1+1/8in. Pretty deceiving imho...<br />Not bad if that's what you are looking for, however I bought this specifically because I need at MINIMUM a 1.5 inch barrel for my hair, so this sadly has to go back.",1
2,"This henna was VERY runny. It almost seems like the maker mixed powder and water together at a bad ratio. I did henna tattoos at a school festival, I saw one of the tattoos I did a couple days after it was done. I was very disappointed with the stain. It was very light and already fading, even after I put spray on the henna paste so it would have more time to stain the skin. Very disappointed.",1
1,"I bought this because I wanted a moisturizing lip gloss.  Nothing special though, for the $30!!  After a few mins of applying this to my lips it dried out and left my lips  dry.  You're better off buying yourself a $5 lip gloss from Target!!",1
1,"Real Simple magazine recommended this mascara so I gave it a try.  Usually Real Simple Magazine is spot on.  This time they were not!<br /><br />I have never had a problem with a mascara melting before, and wanted one that would give a lengthening appearance of my lashes.  After a hot day in Texas, this mascara 'melted' under my eyes leaving dark mascara under my bottom lashes.  Then when I went to wash it off, with my eyes closes, it ran into my eyes causing itching and a lot of discomfort for hours!  All that, and I did not notice any difference in the appearance of my lashes from store bought mascaras.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product at all!",1
2,Found it difficult to use...was hard to get the hair in the groove which is too bad since I had high hopes for it.  It might be worth a try if you are using on someone else's hair though.<br /><br />Unfortunately I had to return mine.,1
2,Was excited to find this fragrance (white musk) but unfortunately it has no scent. Maybe they forgot to add the fragrance to the oil. Hopefully I will have better results with another vendor.,1
1,"I'm a sucker for glittery eyeliner, but I bought this in green and in silver, and both of them flake right into my eyeballs! I literally have to pick flecks of glitter out of eye days after wearing it. I finally threw them away, since it didn't seem safe. Too Faced makes a similar product that seems to stick better.",1
1,Nice looking unit. However I had to return it as it had a faulty light socket which fused the circuit. The replacement did exactly the same thing and it was returned also. Too bad as it was an excellent value if it had worked.,1
1,"I ordered three items of the the Revaleskin line and the night cream was from BD Great Buys.  The other two- intensive treatment and cleansing cream- were great from the packaging to the material inside it but the one from BD Great Buys was first of all, in a language other than english.   When I opened it up the wrinkled box, the label on the bottle was completely askew, coming off the edges.   I decided to try it and for the first couple of weeks, the product came out fine and the material inside seemed to be okay but after the two weeks, the dispenser on the top started to stick.  Many times, I had to push the top with my palms with my weight on it to get the product out.  Even though the discount was good, why does a $60 product feel like something from the dollar store?  I feel like it is BD Great Buys who are selling questionable products.  The recovery cream and the cleanser are amazing in material and the packaging. It never gave me any problem.",1
1,Towel heated to luke warm at best could have been defective....sent back... Still debating if I will reorder or upgrade to a different one.,1
1,When I got it and started using it I noticed that the plates didn't close completely only at the top part and I had to press very hard for it to touch. I returned it and got my refund. I am wondering if I should order a new one or just a different one,1

1,"[[ASIN:B005TI7EWK Crest 3D White Intensive Professional Effects, 7 Count]]  Decided to try out the Intensive Professional Effects 3d White Strips, and without a doubt, it was the worst mistake I have ever made.  I used them for 3 days with minor discomfort.  After the 4th treatment I decided to stop because I was having sensitivity issues.  About 14 hours after stopping I started having horrible pain in two of my teeth.  It felt as though someone was drilling into my teeth, and the pain was shooting through my entire mouth.  I tried everything from Anbesol to taking Asprin and Aleve.  Nothing worked.  The pain got worse.  I'm now sitting here 60 hours after my last use and I am still in horrible pain.  I now am on my way to see my dentist because I can't take another night without sleep.  Hopefully they can help but I would suggest that no one ever uses these things",1
2,"In my opinion, So Totally Clean Cleanser is not the same as the original ten-o-six formula.  The bottle contains less than half as much as the original formula bottles for the same price.  Bonne Bell should go back to their original formula of ten-o-six and I'm sure many people would be much happier with their product.",1
1,"Product listing from vendor ScentedMonkey is misleading at \\""3.4\\"" ounces. I ordered this product from vendor at listed price of $22.23 for \\""3.4 oz.\\"" I was sent the 1.7 oz. size instead.

1,"After reading several reviews, this product got quite a few positive ones. So, with my unruly frizzy hair I decided to purchase it. Soooo terribly disappointed. Does absolutely nothing. Well, maybe for the first few hours after a fresh wash. But, after that.....total frizz as if I never used it. Do not waste your  money.",1
1,Not what I expected.  It is hard to use because it is so flimsy.  Not sure if it does anything for the skin. I was disappointed.,1
2,"I recently received the Gillette Venus Olay Razor as part of a campaign from Gillette. I am a long time user of the Venus Embrace and I believe  I will continue to use my old razor.<br /><br />I found the Venus Olay to be wonderful for about a week. It provided a nice smooth and clean shave while providing the moisturizing effects of Olay. However, after a few days the soap began to disintegrate. I even kept the razor in the holder provided but every time someone used the shower, it got a little bit smaller and smaller. Of course, the blades were still plenty sharp and providing a great shave so I was left in a pickle. I felt wasteful throwing it away but it was awkward to use it with the plastic soap holders hanging off the sides.<br /><br />Overall, you will not be disappointed by this razor but I would recommend the Embrace. It lasts about 4 weeks without getting dull and stays moisturized throughout.",1
1.0,"This brush (clear) really is unbelievably stiff. That's what I thought I was looking for to help me exfoliate, but after two months of use it still feels like a brillo pad on my back. And when you put soap on the bristles, it doesn't lather up. It just sinks into the bristles then you have to dig it out. I'm surprised at all the good reviews. Might be good as a back scratcher but not for cleansing. Unless you hate having skin.",1
1,Product came dry. It does not work!,1

1,"Not an accurate posting. It says 19mm curler in the title then 25mm everywhere else in the details, photo, and description. I assumed I was receiving a 25mm curler and it was 19mm.

1,"I placed the order due to the picture of the plates in the photo and the nail colors shown. Neither was the same! So now I'm stuck with plates I will not use and nail colors where I will only be using one. Waste of money and I will not order from this seller again!

2,"I feel like this is better for people who have really dry skin. I used a pump on my face after I washed it, and my skin had that dry tight feeling to it. Well in less than 30 minutes, indoors, my forehead was oily and my cheeks and nose started shining too. I was disappointed. I found that if I have to use it, I have to use maybe a quarter of a little pump and even then, I'm not a fan of how it felt on my skin.",1
1,"Waste of money! Flaked off of bottom lashes in 15 min. after application, same time black/gray under eye circles appeared. No long lashes. No mascara left on at the end of 3-4 hours.",1
1.0,"I do not like this scent at all. I am by no means a young or old man. I am 32yrs old and have tried many of aftershaves, but I have to say, this is definitely something grandpa would wear. I had thoughts of being in one of those old School \\""Brute\\"" commercials. I would actually prefer \\""Brute\\"" if I had to choose. The scent may be a favorite of many others but will not be mine. I do not think many of the other reviews actually held true to what this smelled like. Its just more of a scent for a manly woman or an OLD man. I hope this may help someone.",1
1,"The containers all had their seals broken, so they were not usable.  There was no way to verify they were not contaminated.",1
1,"I give this product 1 star because I can't give it a Zero. I bought this porduct as a 2 for one deal thinking I was saving money over my normal brand. ( i usually use John Freida) Anyways, I do not like to wash my hair every day, if i did not sweat, so I sprayed this product on my hair and initially it did soak up the oil, but then the smell hit me... It was like a cross between rotting citrus and BO... In fact it smelled so much like BO, that I stopped to smell myself, and the clothes I put on, and the towel I had just used after getting out of the shower a few minutes before. Nope it wasn't me, it was the spray, I even had my husband smell it and he agreed. I had to take a second shower to get rid of the aweful odor, I threw both the cans away... This is dissapointing because I like suave products and thought this would be a good one and save me some money....",1
2,"I find this is not near enough moisture for the under eye area, and it just seems to dry it out more. I don't have any wrinkles thankfully but my skin is too dry for this stuff. A great eye area moisturizer is philosophy hope in a tube eye and lip cream, which is really moisturizing and I regret trying to save money by choosing another product instead of that one. I think for people with oily skin this would be a good product though but def not for dry skin and I imagine older mature skin would not benefit from this either.",1

1,"I don't like the smell, but worse, I can't believe how difficult it was to wash it out of my hair.  Thank goodness I only used it to hold my bangs slicked back.  I can't imagine how horrible the experience would have been had I used it throughout my hair.  I had to shampoo twice, and use inordinate amounts of shampoo just to get it all out.<br /><br />I want to grow my bangs out. With this glue in my hair, I can't run my fingers through it.

When I first received it I was impressed with how heavy duty the plastic was but as soon as I started to look at it I was dissappointed with the depth and size of each &#34;holder&#34;. They are not very useable. Only the back two &#34;holders&#34; are deep enough to hold make up brushes or eyelines, everything else really is like just having a piece a plastic underneath my make up. I thought I could make it work and now I am outside the return window with a piece of heavy duty plastic in my closet. Then the front &#34;holders&#34; have curved inside corners which even limit how many eye shadows it could hold. Very upset I didn't go with my gut and send it back the day I got it.",1

1,"My wife recently made this purchase to replace an almost-empty 4-year old bottle of the same.  When it arrived, she asked me to compare the scent of the two bottles.  Although the scent was the same fragerence, the newer bottle smelled somewhat weaker...noticeably weaker.<br /><br />After using it three times in the past month, she also discovered that the essence didn't last for more than a minute or so..... I concur.<br /><br />She is disappointed.",1

THERE ARE MANY IRONS AT A LOWER PRICE THAT ARE BETTER THAN THIS.,1
2,after about 6 months it stopped working and would just give off a high pitch sound. doesnt get any reeption and when i turn it on either nothing happens or the really high pitch sound blows you away! i suggest looking into one that will last longer.,1
1,The fragrance did NOT live up to previous Egyptian Musk ( same company) purchased at a local health food store.<br />It came with a different color top.<br /> (Gold instead of Black)<br />I would not order from this company again due to the above.<br />The positive point is that it was delivered promptly.,1

2,"After previously buying another product from the same manufacturer, I was looking forward to this soap for the fresh pine smell I experienced previously. Unfortunately, the smell is more like the actual pine tar, not pine trees. Smells like stale campfire smoke, or tar, or burning rubber, and the smell is very strong... not just when using the soap but all the time. Made the entire bathroom stink. Had to find different soap and throw this one out.",1
1.0,The hot roller set made by Conair did not come with clips. Right away this should have been a sign that these hot curlers may not be the best. I ordered these clips and they arrived the day after the hot curler set. Like others I cannot get the clips to stay on the curler on my hair. This entire set seems bogus to me. The clips slide right off.  I cannot recommend these clips for this set of hot rollers.<br /><br />Not Recommended. prisrob 06-28-15,1

1,"Very low quality... I'm so disappointed.  I bought this for my daughter as a gift as she is always doing fun things with her nails.  The concept is great, but this actual product just doesn't quite hit the mark.  The design discs seemed ok, but the plastic scraper used to scrape the excess polish off the top of the desing disc was very poorly crafted.  It's edges aren't smooth, making it dificult to use.  The rubber 'dauber' used to transfer the images from the design discs to the finger nail wasn't any better.  Instead of a smooth, rounded surface, it has places where it is raised and rough, causing the images to blur and smear.",1
2,"My old Norelco trimmer finally died so my wife gave me this trimmer as a Christmas gift. Fortunately she kept the receipt, because it's going back. The vacuum feature is pretty much useless aside from whirring a lot. The intake is a gaping slot behind the trimmer blades, but the suction there is negligable. If my face was a perfectly vertical plane and all my whiskers were at 90-degree angles then this arrangement might almost work. As it is, it doesn't. Between the odd angle of the slot and the air blowing from the fan at the bottom it seems to toss stuff around even more than my old trimmer. I guess I'll try Norelco's vacuum model.",1
1,"I gave a positive review to Porcelana cream some months ago, but now I am coming back to rewrite my former opinion because don't want to create karma supporting any kind of cream containing hydroquinone.<br /><br />Porcelana cream DID work on me and it was marvelous seeing how brown spots faded when applied on, BUT the bad news came a few months after I stopped applying it on face. Years ago, I used to have really dark spots that looked very bad on a very fair skin after a dermatologist burned my skin with a too harsh solution. The spots went fading gradually as I took care of my skin with 100 spfsunblock, peels and avoiding sun. When I employed this cream results were great and my spots almost disappeared, but some months after, despite applying 100 spf sunblock daily and avoinding sun, the brown spots came back and darker!!! I read it is was side efect of hydroquinone and will never ever apply something containing HQ in. After worsening, I went to apply other stuff and results are permanent and my skin uneven coloration is not worsening anymore. So avoid HQ! it is true that it has a rebound effect!",1

2,"I thought the color was too dark and garish.  Even though the shade was very natural and worked with my natural coloring, it was so intense that I found it impossible to blend and my makeup looked amateurish and overdone.  At 60 years old, I am not a beginner and can usually make any cosmetic work, but this was too hard for me to work with and I discarded it.",1
1,The color came out beautiful. That's the only upside. What a mess! Its not worth it! Ever since I dyed my hair 4 days ago its been a nightmare!!!! It stains! Everything! My bathtub is blue from rinsing my hair it won't come off! The palms if my hands stay a nasty blue color from anytime I run my fingers through my hair. My pillow is blue and that's sleeping with my hair dry. Everything my hair touches turns blue dry or wet!!!! Like it just rubs off....I will never use this product again.,1
2.0,Did not come with spacer as noted.,1
2,"I won't lie, I am very new to a skin care regimen.  I started up recently because now that I'm in law school, I feel I should...because the other women are doing it.  I have always had a young face but apparently there is always room for improvement.<br /><br />I started using this the day after I received it.  I am using it this in the morning following my Olay recommended regimen.  They are:<br />Olay Pro-X<br />Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System (twice a week for microdermabrasion, twice a day to clean my face on non-microdermabrasion days, once a day to clean my face on microdermabrasion days)<br />Olay Total Effects Nourishing Cream Cleanser Skin Care (twice a day)<br />Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Eye Treatment (twice a day)<br />Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Night Firming Treatment (at night)<br /><br />I had originally signed up to get it through the Subscribe and Save because, well, 15% off isn't bad.  I had read reviews that said it was a light moisturizer, they saw results in two weeks, this that and the other.  I have seen no results from this.  After the night treatment at least I can say I like the way my face feels.  This makes my skin feel oily, makes me extremely shiny, and has caused me to break out.  I am giving it 1 star for the sunscreen since, well, it's sunscreen and I can't complain too much about being protected on my 20-minute drive to school.  I am giving it 1 more star because Olay has a money-back guarantee I'm going to try to go after.<br /><br />I am reducing this a star because even though the most often subscribed amount is 3 months, I am in no way sure how you get even one month out of this.  There's not very much in this container and unless you're up to smooshing your face, it does not go very far.  I am reducing this another star because I hate the way that it dispenses.  I never know how much I'm going to get per pump so I have to watch it and go slow.  Even though I use the same amount every day, I usebetween 1 and 8 pumps due to the erratic nature of the delivery system.  I also know that toward the end of this, there's going to be some left in the bottom that I'll never be able to access or use.  This wouldn't bother me except that I do like the way the other creams are just in a jar and I can take or leave whatever I need.  My guess this delivery system is because of the sunscreen, since that has to be in a light-proof container to prevent a reaction.  I am reducing this one last star because every time I use it, I break out.  While I certainly can't fault being protected from the sun for 20 minutes a day, I cannot in my life imagine how anyone can put this on every two hours per the directions.  I put it on once in the morning and I am oily all day.  I thought that this would go down as my skin became used to it but I was admittedly wrong.  I did not start out by doing the every two hours when I realized how deep this did not go.  Many days I have to blot it off.  I know what you're thinking--&#34;Oh, that's your makeup!&#34;  I don't wear makeup.  I really cannot stand the feeling of something on or around my face.  Don't want, don't like.  I honestly am only two weeks into the regimen but for that last reason alone, I can't do it anymore.",1
1,"Two problems with the Schick Quattro blade-<br /><br />1) It gives you so many nicks you'll have to put a gigantic bandage over the entire area you just shaved or around 10 little pieces of toilet paper - even if you just broke out a new cartridge<br /><br />2) The blades clog so completely with hair after the first stroke that you have to use your finger to wipe down with the blade direction (against it would cut your finger, obviously) to unclog it after every stroke or two, depending on how thick you are<br /><br />If you dont want this problem, get a double-edged safety razor by Merkur. They are easy as pie to unclog and hardly make you bleed at all compared to multi-blade razors.",1
1,"This is an ok lip balm, but it doesn't really smell like chocolate and it sure as heck doesn't taste like chocolate (or anything really) like it claims. This is sooooo not worth the almost $7 price tag.",1
2,"When it comes out of the box and I first start using it, the air is powerful but definitely not hot enough.  So the more I have used it over some months of time the hotter it has gotten, which I really like.  But the last few weeks I have noticed some sparking.  Freaks me out a bit!  I have been buying this brand for a while and my previous ones just shut down after about a year but this ones sparks.  Time to buy another blow dryer I guess.  Sparking from an appliance is never good.",1
1,"I can't stand fraudulent businesses! And bare in mind, people pay for reviews now! All the positive comments are fake because THIS DOESN'T WORK!!! Not at all!! I doubt it has 2% Hydroquinone in it not to talk of 10% HQ. The ponds brightening cream even does a better job! You're better off mixing crusader and movate by far! BE WARNED!!!!",1

1,"The item received is not right in smell, color, and function. I am familiar with this brand and line as I have been using it in the past and know the appearance and the results of using the product. The chemicals used inside this bottle are different than the manufacturers' contents and not as labeled.<br /><br />As a result of using this fraudulent item, my hair became coarse, weak, and fell out. When using the original item, my hair responded with smoothness, workability, and hydration. Again, this item is not as it states.<br /><br />Do not purchase Kerastase from this merchant!",1
2,"I've been wearing 4711 (original) and 4711 Ice on-and-off all my life (it was my dad's scent and, being a daddy's girl, I would sneak some) so I was very excited to try 4711 Nouveau as I thought it would be a more feminine version of the classic. I bought a bottle blindly and am sorely disappointed. It smells nothing like the original (or the Ice version). What I liked about the original 4711 and Ice is that it is very light, unobtrusive, and refreshing in that citrusy-leafy way. Nouveau is a very floral scent with a bit of fruity undertones. Its very sweet and, in the hot, summer months, can be cloying.<br />I will wait to see how this performs in the colder time of year. Maybe it won't be as cloying and the floral scent will be more appealing but for now, its the ugly triplet in my 4711 collection. Will stick to the original and Ice for now.",1
1,Mine came broken.,1
2,"I have thick curly hair. It can take up to an hour and a 1/2 to straighten my hair so naturally preserving the straightness for a day would be amazing. However like most things this product was just too good to be true. My first complaint is that it stinks. It made my hair smell like I burned in-scents or hung out a a hooka bar all night. Its a very ashy smell, in my hair it smelled like baby powder the next morning (when I was ready to wash it). Second complaint is that is just doesnt work. I was using it to get the slightly oily look out of my hair. It made it worse. My hair looked extra greasy and flat. I got absolutely no volume from using this. Even after throughly brushing and slightly back combing the root. My third complaint is the directions on the bottle are not very clear of how much product is needed for it to work. I havent used it long enough to know if my bottle would clog and I doubt that I will ever use it again. For something that is supposed to make you feel clean and  refreshed after using this product I just felt dirty.",1
2,"The description sounded good but the product did not live up to its claim. I was expecting something more like the Soft Picks which has a bristle brush whereas these do not. They are made of hard plastic which have sharp edges and can, and do, lacerate the gums. Also I found that they are pretty thick and do not fit well between every tooth.",1
2,they are really tiny and don't work that well they also stained my hair!,1

1,"Okay, straight up: fragrance does not belong in moisturizer, period full stop. My skin is extremely sensitive and irritable, and I have to be really careful what I put on it. I used the 30 SPF in this product line for years, and it never caused me any problems. (Actually, I switched from Neutrogena some years ago because it started to cause stinging when applied, and the 30 SPF was a welcome relief.)  When I went to put the SPF 15 on my face, I was dismayed to realize that the product contained a fragrance. I didn't have any other moisturizer with sunscreen in the house, so I had no choice but to use it. Now my face is itchy and hot, and I am filing a report with J&J's hotline.<br /><br />tl;dr Bad for sensitive skin.",1

Dry, the curl doesn't stay.",1
1,this is not worth the money and it doesn't stay on and I dislike the color. I wanted Honeylove but that went up in price before I could buy it so I settled on this color since it was less expensive from the site and I regret not sticking to a brand from Walmart such as L'oreal. I will never buy another MAC lipstick for that money.,1

2,I've had Remington's before and I must say this is not their best product.  It can be found cheaper if you must have it but I also have used Braun's before and is a superior product although much more expensive.  I have tried many different methods of shaving but this razor still burns my face everyday no matter what i do.  I have not had any problem with battery charge as some have talked about.,1
1,"Order several different oils from them all came at once. Each oil smelled and looked the same. I order apricot, almond, wheat germ, and avocado all very different oils and should feel and smell different. So I toke the bottles to my local organic market had the lady there smell the oils and give me her opinion. She said she thought the oils smelled like veg or corn oil, she toke me to her oil section and let me sample the oils on my skin and yes there suppose to smell different too. She said the company is stating there organic but there are laws that have to be followed in order to be organic and seals on each bottle are on of those laws. There were no seals on these bottles and the label is printed from home. On the label it said 10oz the seller scratch that out with pen and wrote 16oz to the side of it. When I got home I contacted the seller for a return they declined my request. I know I only spent 36.00 with the seller but its the principle so I will be contacting amazon and the seller (everyday) until I get a return. Good luck to anyone who buys from this seller!",1

2,"I am 25 and was having a lot of trouble with acne, and was looking for any way out. I got the tandazap in a desperate need for SOMETHING. I quickly realized that it was kind of pointless for me. I had too many pimples to hold that thing at my face for 3 minutes on each spot. If you get 1 pimple, once in awhile, maybe its what you need. But for regularly getting multiple pimples, its simply not realistic. Its now in my cabinet, and I have not used it since the few weeks I bought it.",1

2,"There are two flavors, Original and Gentle Mint Gel.  The Gentle Mint Gel kind has been my favorite for years.  Recently Biotene updated the formula to this new \\""improved pH balance.\\""  Now it is completely different, it tastes more salty and medicinal, whereas the original Gentle Mint Gel has a nice subtle impression.  Some companies never learn that if it's not broken, don't fix it (and make it worse!).<br /><br />Update: I recently discovered that \\""Biotene PBF Plaque Loosening Toothpaste\\"" feels more similar to the original formula, and Glaxo hasn't mangled that one quite as much, yet.  So I recommend Biotene PBF instead.<br /><br />Update 2: Now Biotene PBF also switched over to the new ingredients.  But I found a 3rd party seller on Amazon with some inventory of the old Biotene with an expiration date 2 years from now.",1
2,This is old perfume as I have had Red before and this is really old.,1
2.0,I've tried many ointments for my Blepharitis. This did not work very well. Left my eyes sticky and irritated. Vaseline works far better than this at a fraction of the cost. Just apply Vaseline before bed. Don't waste the money on this product.,1
1,"I got this product as a long-wear replacement for ordinary lipstick and colored lip balm. Don't. It fades MUCH faster than ordinary lipstick (despite being marketed as a stain), leaves a really ugly, neon pink residue (you know, the sort that you find on your lips in the morning after falling asleep with a pigment-heavy lipstick on), and feels like a heavy, almost plastic-like film on your lips - much less comfortable than ordinary lipstick. I feel completely ripped off. It didn't even last as long as the Burt's Bees colored balm I usually wear, which I love the color of but which comes off all over my coffee cup and needs to be reapplied every hour. I might as well have stuck with that, because Lipfinity fades much faster than one hour, and instead of just wearing off, it leaves a hideous residue behind. The only silver lining is that it's so short-lasting that I was able to see the ugly, faded residue before I even got out the front door, so I put a normal lipstick on to hide it before I embarrassed myself in public. Total waste of money. The search for a good stain continues.",1
1,I didn't like it. It made my hair feel really dry and brittle after I used it. Just wish I hadn't bought so large a bottle.,1
2.0,"Was disappointed with my purchase.  I've never bought Myrrh before but judging by the pictures I was expecting to receive a bag of dark amber resin chunks.  What I received, however, looked nothing like the pictures.  My first thought was someone sold me a bag of crap.....literally.  Granted, there were a few resin-type chunks mixed in but there was also sand in the bottom of the bag, a few small sticks, a few rock flakes, what looked to be a couple of strands of animal hair, and a piece of corn.  I'm not sure how they harvest the stuff but it looked like they just scraped it off the ground along with whatever else was there too.  I'd bought some Frankincense from this seller as well and it was fine but this seems sub-par.  I gave it two stars since there were at least a few pieces of resin in the bag and thankfully it was cheap so no big loss but still......corn?",1
1,"I've worn this perfume for about 3 years now. I used to work in fragrance and cosmetics; I'm not sure why I tried to get it for a cheaper price online, but I bought Very Irresistible from this seller. The instant I opened it and smelled it, it didn't smell like the perfume I usually wear. When the fragrance settles, it has more of an acidic smell to it than the warm scent it usually has. It doesn't seem to mix well with my body chemistry like it usually does. This could be due to a change in my own body chemistry or the particular batch of perfume, but I think the perfume I received is a fake, and that is my final verdict.",1
2,THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT &#34;EXTREME HOLD&#34; WAS A GREAT PRODUCT BUT WHAT I RECEIVED WAS<br />&#34;PUNK&#34; NOT AS GOOD A PRODUCT FOR MY HAIR ANYWAY,1
1,"Terrible, doesn't fit we'll and pushes my chin up so that it hurts my jaw, useless item. Don't waste money.",1
1,"Its been several weeks now, about 5 weeks to be exact and no results at all. I've used it as instructed by label and clinique customer serivice advice; still no results.",1
1,"The product broke my scalp out in hives. Has a strong 'medicine' type odor. Now I'm told it is nonreturnable even though I suffered a rash.  No refund or exchange and a rash, not what I was hoping for.",1
1,sprayer did not work,1
1,"Tried this for several months.  One time a woman started talking to me in a public place which was encouraging.  Then I remembered I had not worn the product that day.  I didn't notice any change overall.  More importantly:  One night I REALLY wanted this stuff to work with my wife, so I used a healthy amount.  Well - no effect there either:  not that time and not any other time.  These reviews do not make it easy to tell what is going on with this product but it did not work for me and it is not returnable.  So, I will not be buying more.<br /><br />That said I have some left and I suppose I'll use it some more, I will update this if anything changes but it's been several months and I doubt that will be the case.",1
1,I received wrong product:-(....,1
2,"I tried the Clean Peak body spray as well as the Fresh Force scent.  The Clean Peak, as with the deodorant, smells like laundry detergent to me.  The Fresh Force is a lighter scent, hints of citrus with an outdoorsy scent but I wasn't impressed by either scents.",1
1,These are very ugly eyelashes!! I bought these as a gift for my sister in law... they are too ugly to give.  There are to kinds sent... tarantula and barely anything.,1
1,"The clippers could not be adjusted to cut below a few millimeters, and became very hot with regular use.  The mini trimmer became inoperable after only a couple weeks.",1
1,The size was not correct i got an 8.5 oz instead of the 18.6 not satistfied at all very disappointed,1
1.0,Looked nothing like the picture..just a straight wig..,1
1.0,This product had no effect on my teeth whatsoever. I will try to get a refund.,1
1,"Very disappointed!  I was looking for a natural deodorant that worked.  Dr.  Hauschka usually makes good products but this, is a failure.  I applied it I the am, wen to the gym and had a terrible aroma when I arrived home. Wish I could return it.  That was a lot of money to spend for it NOT to work",1
2,Disappointing as color isn't always accurate.,1
2.0,"Update: I've had this sponge for a couple months and it has already started to tear at the top. I noticed it is starting to tear in other places. I've used their product in the past before but i guess this one isn't as good as the last one.    This is made really nicely. It came already damp, which was nice. I could use it right away and not have to wait while it went from dry to wet.",1
1,"They said it would have no or little pain. They lied, this product was very painful. I rushed to send it back and get my refund!  I do not recommend this prouduct at all. I didn't give it any stars becasuse it didn't deserve any but I had to.",1
1.0,Waist of money. It never worked. Taking it out of the package was a waist of time because it was always broken!!!!!,1
1,"Do not order from this vendor.  I ordered this item over a month ago from them, and just received a notice saying that it was out of stock and they would be refunding my payment.  And the exact same item is still listed on Amazon as being for sale.  They are a terrible vendor, can't even keep track of their inventory or cancel listings for items that are out of stock.  Do yourself a favor and don't buy from the Vitamin Shoppe",1
1,"Now I remember why I never owned a rotary/Norelco shaver before.  Even after pre-soak and gel lather and after shave my neck is still red, raw and stingling hours later.  Going back to foil and try for a refund on this one, or it's going on EBAY.",1
2,"Hard to know how to review this item, since the product itself is awesome, but the description of the item (Sold by VanDerPloeg ) is INCORRECT. While the item is titled &#34;Avon Sss Original Oil 5oz With Pump&#34; -- and the item I received is indeed labelled identically on the plastic bag that encloses it -- THERE WAS NO PUMP RECEIVED WITH THE PRODUCT, just a cap on the bottle. (See previous two-star review with the same comment.) I would rate it as five stars if the pump had come with it per description.",1
1,"The color I got (newlywed) is shimmery and the color looks uneven and smeared even when applied liberally. It wasn't attractive or flattering in any way, whatsoever. It offered no plumping action at all, even when I applied it repeatedly. Though, the color alone is enough to send it back (which I'm doing). Was a huge waste of time and money.",1
1,too expensive for 0.15 fl.oz  I think the picture on web site is misleading.,1
2,"Never Buy this one again, now that I have found the one that has black base AND Mascara!  My lashes looked so clumpy having to cover the white base with 3 coats of the mascara, ridiculous.",1
1,"This product is fake. Plz don't use it. It will cause skin burn, skin redness and the burn is very very painful. I use this brand all the time. This product is fake.",1
2,"This lipstick is very soft and mushy as you put it on your lips, not sure it's really MAC.",1
1,Wish I hadn't spent the money. You get what you pay for though.,1
2,I just have to be honest and say that even though I tried to go natural with my deodorant and not use all the harsh chemicals and aluminum that most other deodorants have...this stuff just didn't work. The scent makes you think you are going to be fresh but by the end of the day I just ended up smelling worse than if I hadn't used any deodorant at all. Not sure what the deal with this stuff was.,1
2.0,I've only met 3 people in my life who have smaller hands than me and this was pretty tight on me,1
1,"One of the most disturbing things happened to me with this product and Amazon.com:<br /><br />It came used.<br /><br />This item comes in a plastic wrap that holds all 6 deodorants. In my case the plastic was torn, one was taken out and used. You can tell because the deodorant level on the removed one was pushed higher than the others and the top was smoothed (happens on first use). The actual shipping container was fine and sealed so UPS didn't touch it! It's disturbing to think the person packaging this removed one, used it, put it back and then continued to package it before shipping it to me. I don't think I'll be ordering anymore personal hygiene items from Amazon.com.",1
1,"I've used Miss Clairol Extreme Blondes HL-V for 20 years.  Ever since they changed the formula to the &#34;Soy4Plex&#34; it is just horrible.  It doesn't cover gray, in fact, the last two times I had used it, I couldn't even tell that I had just done my roots.  In general, looks horrible.  Does anyone have a suggestion for a substitute for this?  I need to find something else ASAP.",1
2,This drawer liner was supposed to smell like lilacs. My dog smells as much like lilacs. I should have used freezer paper and saved a lot of money.,1
1,Great buy. A very good item to recommend to friends and family. I dont feel the need to bathe or i can bathe once in 2-3 days and still feel fresh. You will perspire but you wont smell.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />The crystal breaks apart. Causes sharp edges to form and when i use it underarm it scratches my skin and the pain is irritating me.,1
1,Soooo small,1
2,I heard a lot about this brand and so I thought I give it a go !  This lotion has a faint scent which I don't like and it does not help with my extremely dry skin - so much for the miracle cream!  The Bioderma works better for me !,1
1,This advertised special was a complete rip off.,1
2,"The color was more an olive green, not a beige/cream/brown like it looks like in the picture. Not what I wanted it for.",1
1,Did not help in fact it seemed to make my nails worse.,1
1,product is cheaply made.  Literally just received item in mail and the wristlet strap is caught in the open position eliminating the use of the wallet as a wristlet.,1
1,I bought these for pinning quilts. Cheaply made. Coating was coming off before I even used them. Half were dull and bent easily.  Some snagged fabric when pushing through the fabric.  Would not recommend.,1
2,"So I got this hair dye at my college for free and decided to try it out. I'm naturally a darker blonde color so this warning goes out to those of you with blonde hair. The dye is really easy to use and works well but on a blonde the color does not turn out anywhere near like the box. My hair turned out VERY red. Perhaps a tad more annoying, the hair color is permanent on my hair. I talked to my hairdresser and it has to do with the porosity of blonde hair (not the dye itself). I just wanted to send the warning out to my fellow blondes. While I liked the color, I purposely used a semi-permanent dye to avoid the problems with roots showing but i'm running into those problems anyway.",1
1,"Awful. Bought 1 and it was great. Lasted a few months and began to wear out, thinned and holes got bigger. Reordered two and they were awful. 1st turned black as it molded around the edges and began to smell in under two weeks. Tried the 2nd and same thing happened but this time in less than a week as the mold covered the entire cloth. Sent an email to company that I bought from and never heard back. Am trying a different company now.",1
1,I paid for mags and got round not bad but not what i wanted wont be buying from these guys anymore,1
1,It is extremely small!! I had to returne it,1
1,So ive been using this for about two months and it has done absolutely nothing for my cellulite at all<br />Disappointed,1
1,I have bought the international charger for International Power Supply for eMagine Epilator MP18(100V to 240V). I noticed that the Voltage for Depilator is 3.4V - 1200 mA. But the charger output is 12V - 400 mA. As a result of this when I start to use the charger the epilator gets very hot. Be careful !!! This adapter has different out put!!!<br />On the Website of Emjoi you can find technical mistake! And customer service do not care about wrong info!,1
2,has no scent,1
2,"Its very hard to actually make it work, but once you find a way its kind of painful, leaves bruises around lips, and it also only last about 10 mins.",1
1,"This product did not do nothing for me no more than the poli grip paste,  I would not recommend<br />this to no one.",1
1,I usually love Egyptian musk perfume oil. This version is my one that I will not wear. There is something different about the scent. I tried a few samples and I like the Sweet musk much better. Maybe this Egyptian Musk doesn't like me. This is a first. However the Sweet Musk smells beautiful on. The Egyptian Musk smells yucky on. I was highly disappointed. This is going back!,1
1.0,Junk,1
1,Didn't work.,1
1,Sticks to nail polish and leaks onto newly painted nail underneath. Might have to be a 2 day project instead of 1,1
1,"This razor is a great idea, and it really does get into places (like the corner between the moustache and beard) that other razors don't go. The (special-purpose nonstandard) blades are dull out of the box, however, and are worthless after one or two uses. The blades are also not stainless steel, so they rust unless you take them out of the razor after every use and dry them off.  I tossed my moustache razor after a couple months of struggle, because I got tired of the pulling and the stubble that results from a dull blade.    If you want accuracy with a razor that takes standard blades, consider a \\""Classic\\"" open-comb razor like the [[ASIN:B0009IEAUY Merkur Classic Safety Razor, Open]] or [[ASIN:B00333GSLQ Merkur 25C Long Handle Double Edge Safety Razor, Open Tooth]]. You can pick up an old Gillette on ebay as well. Be sure to go with the \\""old style\\"" razors (circa 1920), which have a straight comb (as compared to the \\""new\\"" style, where the comb droops down if you look at it from the side, or the \\""tech,\\"" which has a straight bar instead of comb. The latter work fine if you're not trying to trim around a beard, but the straight open comb is the most accurate, since it can come right up to the edge of the beard. Note that a straight-comb razor requires a very delicate touch; you'll cut yourself if you mash down on it.",1
1,"Disappointing to follow all the steps and then It simply did not work at all.  Plus, I ordered the kit, and later saw infomercials on TV with additional products for less money than I paid on Amazon.  Use Crest Strips.",1
1,"Got this for promotional value to try and review, but I can't use it. The scent is over-powering and it's a scent I associate with older gentlemen. I tried to use it on my hair but I couldn't get past the scent. Also, I was under the impression that this is 100% Argan oil, which it is not. The only thing I like about this product is that it's got a pump and it dispenses easily. But it means nothing when I can't get past the scent to actually use it on my hair.",1
1,This stuff is horrible!  It peeled off as soon as it dried. I know what I'm doing and have a professional lamp and the sealer. Not worth the money or time!,1
1,"I ordered this perfume based on the reviews it had, and just opened the box to smell the perfume all over the box. I opened it and as soon as I took the top off it started to leak all over the bottle. I'm extremely disappointed.",1
1,The hair was not at all what I expected and was very very thin...the only good thing is that it came very quickly,1
2,this is pretty but doesn't work very well at all. I would not recommend this file. Pretty but useless. Bad deal,1
1,"I recently purchased & used Avon Nail Art strips. They did last 2 weeks but when I peeled them off my nails were thinner & cracking, the nail bed looked damaged as well, almost like a fungus starting. I have contacted Avon but have had no reply from them. Apparently they do not stand behind their product. I would not use this product again & do not know if the damage to my nails will be permanent or grow out.",1
2,"I purchased this product thinking that it would tame my unruly beard. There are no more rules left in my beard now. The balm has made it unrulier. I thought that this was supposed to flatten my beard. $20 for such a tiny can, and the shipping took a week. Sure it smells great, comes in a cool tin and a fancy burlap sack. It is ok, we'll see how things go, but all in all I am not satisfied with what I got, I expected more.",1
1,Didn't come close to fitting my Norelco QT4021.. Not even worth my time to ship back for a refund.. Not a good buy on my part,1
1.0,I was so disappointed since I didn't received the 2 sets of beauche skin care that I ordered the last time even though I got a refund its frustrating to experienced this kind of situation since I've been ordering the same products for a long time.I hope this would not happen again in my future orders.Thank you.,1
1,"SCAM! Read terms & conditions!<br />Needless to say, I have not seen the results this product promises & I've been using it for more than 30 days. I saw this offer on line & evidently when you click &#34;claim my trial offer,&#34; you are agreeing to pay the $4.95 for the shipping & handling AS WELL AS THE $97.28 PER MONTH UNTIL YOU CANCEL. I called customer service asking for a refund & of course it was...",1
2,"I didn't expect a lot for the price.  I bought 2 packages hoping to get more thickness after the previous review.  I used the 16 inch because I have shoulder length hair and wanted them to blend.  I was able to attach them myself in about 4 hours.  I would recommend enlisting help.  The extensions were pretty thin, and my hair is average to thin in thickness.  I ended up cutting a few more inches off the extensions in an effort to get them to blend better with my natural hair.  I was only able to fit about 125-130 pieces with my hair thickness.  It still seems a bit thin at the bottom, but not bad.  They are very uncomfortable to sleep on, but I'm hopeful that will improve over the next few days.  Overall, for the price, I'm satisfied.",1
1,Pen only worked for a few second (came broken),1
1,"Not what I expected.  Not happy with the product.  It was returned.  I saw it advertized on a popular doctor TV show.  But, at least Amazon took it back.",1
1,Didn't like them. They do not perform well.,1
2,"The product works okay, I haven't noticed that it works any better than any other lotion. My big concern is that the bottle had no seal on it, so how do I know that it wasn't filled with just a cheap lotion that has no tanning effects at all?  I guess that's why it was so cheap.",1
1,Rough* scene*,1
1,When I first started using Juvenil my pimples didn't seem to get as bad and they went away faster. But when I combined it with the Creme 15 my acne improved by like 50% within a few days. Unfortunately it didn't get better after that.  After 3 weeks my skin seems to be getting back to where it was before.  Another thing is the bottle leaks and doesn't dispense the liquid properly. I'm going to end up wasting some of the product because of this. Considering how much this cost Yonka should really consider either changing the bottle or improving it so it doesn't leak and the liquid comes out better.,1
1,"I can't really give you an appreciation of the product, as I had to return it.  The brushes were not compatible with my electric system and did not fit.  Sorry!  However, as usual, AMAZON delivered real fast and the return was without any problem.",1
1,poorly made,1
2,They are too light weight.  They do not give enough support and they smell awful.  They are really very flimsy.,1
1,"I just received my cologne which came packaged in a filthy, musty, torn box, from which someone had torn a store's price tag.  Obviously used, and obviously old.  Will return it promptly.  Yes, the shipping was more than the cost of the cologne.",1
1,Horrible.  Makeup literally  crumpled to pieces. Had to throw  away.  Do not  buy. Terrible  waste of  hard earned  money.,1
1,"Honestly, I thought It would work, but nothing, even though I used it constantly for a month. Not buying it again!",1
1.0,Waited 30 minutes to warm up and it never got hot enough to straighten my hair.,1
1,This product left all of the blemishes that I had applied it on very red and irritated. Dealing with my blemishes was nothing compared to trying to cover up the red splotches that I had all over my face after an overnight treatment.  What a disappointment!!,1
1,"I purchased this product as I was fed up about replacing the Gillette razor every month. Read the review here and thought it will be good. Started using the shaver after reviewing the video on Phillips site. The first time I shaved, the shaver left crease marks on my neck all over. I thought it could be due to the first shave..Did not use for a week and used the blade. Came back to use the razor and the same thing. Also the shaver lot of hairs around the chin area and I have to press hard to get it clean. In some instances I had to use the shaver 2 times (after using a shave cream both times) and also then go back and use the blade. I stopped using the shaver now. I should have got a Braun or Panasonic. The rebate from Phillips I hear is also not being honored with the discount from Amazon.",1
1,"I bought this after reading reviews that it was amazing as a no chip top coat. I have used this on three different manicures and it chips in minutes. I do crafts, painting and other artsy related activities and expect to have mangled nails but this was billed as practically indestructible even when gardening. Not so much. Chipped immediately. I have used a wide range of polishes with it from OPI to Wet N Wild with the same result. Chipping is going to happen and fast. So for those people who are active with their hands this may not be the magic bullet you were looking for, for me it certainly wasn't. So the search continues for a no chip top coat!",1
1,If I could give this no stars I would. My hair is literally black. DO NOT BUY IT. My hair was even already a faded bright red with blonde bits showing through from previous highlights and not even those are red. Im extremely angry and i wont ever be using this brand again.,1
1,"NOT dead skin!! Rub it into a balloon or Xbox controller or ANYTHING, they apparently have skin 'peel' as well!! Try it for yourself!!",1
1,"I agree with the other reviews, the last bottle I bought from Fragrance Net was watery and smelled different--you have to use tons of it to get any lather at all, and it leaves your hair squeaky in a way my previous bottle did not. Fragrance Net may be selling a watered down, fake version, or else B&B reformulated this stuff in the worst possible way.",1
1,Will this be enough to do my whole head,1
2,I bought this to replace my Turbie Twist towels.<br />I really don't like how the microfiber material feels on my wet ears/scalp.<br />It is well made but just not for me.,1
2,"My daughter has wavy blonde hair, and these things do NOT slide on the hair strands easily. The insides have cheap sponges that want to stick to your hair. The color is not as vibrant as the pictures or look as nice.<br /><br />Luckily it was for my 9 year old, so it's fine by her. I wouldn't recommend this is you are over 9 though.",1
2,"I definitely was not as impressed with this conditioner as I had hoped. It for sure helps to make your hair not tangled, but left my hair feeling kinda waxy/sticky. I have thin fine hair that gets oily pretty fast and this did not seem to help my problem...but only made it worse :(",1
2,"I have pretty curly and THICK hair that is hard to maintain.  I'm always looking for different types of shampoos/conditioners every few months and somehow ran into this one.  I can't say it made my hair smoother or shinier, but it did help me de-tangle my hair... so it pretty much worked like any other cheap conditioner.  Very nice smell though.",1
1,"Terrible scale. Have had for about a year, and problems keep getting worse. My wife just weighed herself without shoes and then with--it added TEN POUNDS. So inaccurate. At first I chocked it up to changes in one's body weight over the day, but have now realized that this a worthless scale.",1
1,Did not use this product.  I actually did a search for a specific product and did not notice this was not the product I was looking for.,1
1,"Only used few months and it became bad connection, on and off on and off. It really bother me but can't do anything now.",1
2,"i have boughten the gogodiva 18inch auburn coloured extensions a long while ago and i was very impressed with the quality and amount of hair! had just enough pieces<br /><br />but honestly , i wasnt so impressed with this purchase, comparing to my last purchase of gogodiva hair extensions, you DO get less hair, you get the same amount of pieces but there is ALOT LESS hair then before<br />im not really impressed with it, and i might just look for a new alternative for hair extensions next time im in need for them for a new colour<br /><br />i dyed these a dark red and the colour showed up pretty good , so other then the gram amount, i still partically enjoy these, i do hope you put into consideration to put more hair back into the extensions , some will say &#34; you get what you payed for&#34; but these extensions were definitely better before, and the span of time between my first pair i bought in september and december, there has been change and i noticed first off with the new package design",1
2,Waste of money and it doesn't work for all hair. The only reason I'm giving it a 2 star is because it at least made my hair smell nice.,1
1,Cheap junk.,1
2,"We bought our first Sonicare Elite year before last and have been pleased with the effectiveness it has in keeping our teeth and gums healthy.  After a while, the rubberized button over the on/off switch wore away and tore off, leaving a hole to the inside of the unit.  Water would get inside the unit and we literally had to stick our finger inside of it to turn it on and off.  Well, Phillips has excellent customer service and replaced the unit.  However, less than a year later, our replacement unit did the same thing.  We give up.  We're going to give the Oral-B Triumph a try.    Overall:  A+ on customer service, A+ on product effectiveness, F on durability and quality.",1
1,This product is awful. It hurts so badly and leaves red marks on the skin. It would be better to pluck out your hairs instead because it does not even pick up every hair it only takes out a few here and there and it burns your skin. DO NOT BUY THIS it is awful. I have tried it on thin and thick hair and it hurts both places and does not take that many hairs off.,1
2,"I was hoping this was the miracle for my seborrehic dermatitis that I have suffered for 4 years now. My wedding is coming up, and I chose to get off the steroid cream and on to something else. My dermatologist wasn't being helpful so I wanted to try some things on my own.<br /><br />In trusting Amazon reviews, I purchased this. I didn't want to spend crazy amounts of money on some 'serum', and was hoping something with natural ingredients would aid my woes.<br /><br />I quickly found out that this wasn't much of a moisturizer unless I caked it on. To the point that my face was white in the areas that I was suffering red, scaly skin. While it did hydrate my skin, and would help overnight in to the next day for part of the day, there are days that I continually have to reapply and reapply, sometimes as often as every 30 minutes if I'm not caking it on (something I didn't want to do at work when I have to work with others).<br /><br />As for positives with this product, I did notice that it has fixed some bumps that were on my face that seemed they would never go away. I believe one of them was an acne scar that felt like I had a bb under my skin. It has dramatically reduced the size of it, but it was only after I was creating a &#34;mask&#34; of this stuff.<br /><br />I was really hoping for it to work, but in my case, it just didn't do what I needed it to.",1
1.0,Absolutely nasty!  How anyone can use this more than twice is beyond me.  And the clay taste stays with you for hours!,1
1,So it was not usable at all very upsetting. I wish the product was as described but it was not,1
1,"I was so excited to get this after reading the reviews. Putting it on wasn't too difficult, the brush seems decent and it went on smoothly. Well, about an hour after application I looked in the mirror and it was smudged all over! I looked like a raccoon. I didn't touch it, I wasn't sweaty or anything. I've tried it quite a few times and it always ends up smudged all over. Will not buy again, highly disappointed.",1
2,"This thing seems to be constructed just fine, but the results just aren't what I expected.  First off, it is awkward to use.  I was never quite sure when I was actually cutting hairs or just doing nothing.  It's a bit hard to know how far in to ram the device to get the hairs.  It takes a long time and a lot of experimentation before you can get trimmed.  Have one or two stray hairs you want to quickly trim with this?  Forget about that!<br />  Granted, this is coming from a guy who is accustomed to having NOTHING in his nose.  I've been using a battery powered trimmer for years, and I cut my nosehairs to the point where they aren't just trimmed- they're gone.  That is not even possible with this thing.  If you're a hippie or just bushy and unkempt or don't mind a few hairs as long as they don't extend beyond the nostril, this product might suit you.  If you want clear nostrils, you're going to have to go with one of the crappy battery-powered models.",1
1,This product did not work for me at all. I hadn't realized how small the tube actually was. It's only for about one or two uses. I don't consider myself to have a low pain tolerance. I have 12 tattoos and several piercings. The product just did not work for me.,1
2.0,These mesh poufs are much smaller than they appear in the picture. They are about the size of a regular lemon. Much too small for an adult to use. I will be throwing them away.,1
1.0,didn't work at all for me.,1
1,"Ever wanted to smell like your great aunt or grandmother? Then this is your cologne. This is a very clumsy mix of mostly jasmine and lavender with the rest of the notes buried deep but occasionally trying to grab attention. After the dry down instead of having the decency to disappear, it desperately clings to clothing.  This blind buy was a bust for me but maybe you have a special 80 year old lady in your life that would love a new bottle.",1
2,"I didn't really care for this shampoo. It could just be me, but it left my hair dry and tangled. I won't be buying this again. I'll stick to Burt's Bees super shiny mango shampoo.",1
1,Awful. Turns you orange.,1
1,"I bought this because it's the only diffuser model made to fit on my T3 Veloce. I decided not to get a universal one because the Veloce is smaller than most hair dryers and I was afraid they wouldn't fit. It fits on my hair dryer (and according to the company, also fits all their Pro models, but NOT the popular Featherweights), and worked very well.... for about 3 days. After using it those first 3 days it started falling off occasionally in the middle of drying, even though I don't dry my hair for very long (it's short, so usually less than 5 minutes) and was definitely not overly vigorous or anything. After another couple of days, when it fell off three times in the course of one hair drying session, I decided to check the little notches that are supposed to lock it into the hair dryer, and I pushed on one of them VERY gently to check that it was elastic enough to lock in securely, and it completely fell off! The other one followed shortly after. This product, though it works well when it stays on the dryer, was absolutely NOT worth the $25 I paid for it, considering that it broke within 5 days of very gentle use! I now have to duct tape it to my hair dryer to get it to stay on.

1,"Why can't a manufacturer make a flat iron that doesn't grab, snag, rip, and pull my hair?

2.0,"My power mach 3 died and I was looking for another.  tried this one.  the first shave nicked and burned.  Knowing that I got multiple shaves form the mach 3 I kept going.  After the 3rd shave things got better! but not great, just ok.  I have a beard and like to shave every other day.  When new this does not work so good but after a couple of shaves, again it is ok.  At the cost of these blades I keep going, and going.  I lose track of how many times but it is a lot.  I shave in the shower so after the first time with the shaving cream I just use lots of water to lightly go over it a second time.",1

1,"I really wanted to like this. It is very silky in finish and made my foundation look beautiful. Sadly, it also broke my skin out terribly which surprised me. The moment I stopped using this my skin cleared back up. I'm returning to Palladio primer. Its very similar and its more at $11 but you get more product and most importantly, no breakouts. The reviewers aren't kidding when they say that e.l.f.'s primer is a tiny amount. Its about the size of a glob on your pinkey finger.",1
1,I was disapointed that clips didn't come already sown on the extensions. Also I've only had them for a couple of weeks and the ends are already fried looking. They were alot thinner than I expected them to be.,1

1,Crapola.  Needs to be constantly plugged in to ac outlet or else it dies fast.,1

After 8 months I had to charge it 24 hours in advance of use because it die after 2/3 min while being used. The charge now only last less then a min and have to charge for 10-15 between uses. I would only use this unit once every 10 days to two weeks or so. Stay away, endless you like buying a new beard trimmer every year or so.",1
1,My item has arrived today and the seal under the cap was not sealed at all!  Not only that but the product smells different from the original.  This is a fake.  Don't waste your hard earned money on this.  Such a disappointment!,1
2,My hair is breaking off and very dry. I ordered this product H2 ION shampoo and conditioner hoping to get help however it has not helped and might even be worse since using the conditioner and shampoo. I read review and was hoping this would work. Cost was high and no improvement at all.,1
2,Whose idea was it to change this product? I was disappointed because this product is very thin now. It is so thin that it is difficult to find when it comes off in the shower. I never know where to look for it. I liked the product better when it was thicker because it provided better protection.,1
1,"I suspect these bands were exposed to UV or heat while in storage. Most broke immediately, the rest broke within 3 days of use.

Instead, these broke more than four times more quickly than the ordinarily weaker black rubber bands I use as short-term \\""break-away\\"" bands for the hair root. (And the black rubber bands I've been using are more than 10 years old). Extremely disappointing performance and not worth even the Amazon \\""add-on\\"" price.",1
1,Bought this at CVS.  Have been coloring my hair for 10 years.  This product is a total waste of time.  I followed the instructions - did not wash my hair first & shook up the bottle multiple times.  It did not cover my gray roots fully.  The results were patchy - some lightly covered & some not covered.  It did not improve the feel of my hair.  Don't waste your money or time.  Now I have to plan a salon visit next week to get this right.,1

2,"The original Skin-So-Soft bath oil is a very successful bug repellent (which I can assure you is no myth, although it may not work for some people).  Unfortunately this bug guard product has fallen victim to the notorious &#34;Coca-Cola Syndrome&#34; (over-tweaking a good thing).  Whatever &#34;picaridin&#34; is does not agree with my lungs--makes me cough.  I went back to the original bath oil, and use the new stuff on kitchen counters and on top of hummingbird feeders to repel ants, for which it does work (but I must be careful not to breathe it in).",1
1,"If you value the safety and health of your children, do not buy these earrings.  My two daughters received these as gifts for a Walt Disney World vacation.  On day 3 of the vacation, while combing my daughter's hair, she said, \\""please don't catch my bad ear Mom\\"".  I asked her, \\""what bad ear\\"" and looked and her ear was all red and puffy.  I immediately took out the earrings (which was a feat in itself as it had melded to her ear), and I couldn't believe what I saw.  There was a hole in her ear the size of a head of a nail.  Both ears were like this on both daughters.  They've worn very cheap earrings from Wal Mart before and never had a problem.  This is the only pair that ever hurt their ears.  I can't believe what they did.  I wish I knew how to attach pictures on here so I could show you the damage they did to my daughters' ears.    Shameful,  Suzanne    P.S.  I figured out how to post pictures - see them just below the product picture at the top!!!",1
1,This is a very poor quality mirror. It has excessive distortion. This is not acceptable so I am returning it. Sometimes paying less costs more.,1
1,Returned. Curls fell out even when I pinned them.,1
2,I am not sure this is an authentic Aqualina Pink sugar product as it does not have the same &#34;sweet&#34; fragrance as the rest of the Pink Sugar line. The packaging also has slightly different designs and different Chili logo than other Aqualina products. Definitely not what I was expecting.,1
1,"I owned the original back in the '80s and loved it.  I just purchased this new model with the promise of 5 different sizes of rollers, 6 each, for a total of 30.<br /><br />It arrived.  With 30 rollers.  As follows:  TWELVE Jumbo/Large (in the ad, they state that Jumbo and Large are two different sizes; they are not.  Roller is clearly marked \\""Jumbo/Large\\"".  There are 6 each of medium, small and petite.<br /><br />I am furious at having been duped.  What's further enraging is that the enclosed roller re-order form actually lists \\""jumbo\\"" and \\""large\\"" with two different SKUs!<br /><br />This is preposterous and deceptive.  Amazon should correct it right away.",1
1,Smelled weird,1
2,"I tried this many different ways - small amounts applied thinly, layered, thicker, with liner - and all led back to 1. it has no more staying power than a good lipstick and 2. it's unwieldy and feathers like crazy. The color was nice and there is a lot of pigment, but those are really the only 2 positive things I can say about this product.",1
2,"I was really hesitant to write a review for something so simple but this product warrants a critique. I purchased it because it was so pretty in gold, but the design of the curler doesn't work. You need to be able to put your fingers into the holes that other curlers have for control.  This product feels cumbersome, its not easy to get it positioned because of the flat ends of the handles.",1
2.0,"I had the same one at work, but this one never seems to melt correctly. The machine seems fine, but the wax it comes with never actually works. I am trained in waxing and no matter what i do, this wax will not pull off the hair.",1
2,"This seemed to be a little too dark for my skin tone, and it was also kind of a thick liquid - so difficult to blend in.  I haven't used it consistently as a result, so I can't say if it works for anti-aging.  The brush is pretty huge - for the under-eyes, and the amount that comes out is way too much to be able to blend in easily.  I think it would just be easier to take the product out of a tube or something.",1

1.0,"I ordered this because I (foolishly) believed that it was POSSIBLE that these were some of the leftover orignal Pears. I was wrong, but I decided to keep the 12 bars anyway.

2,"I have been using this product for 6 months now.  I have not found there to be any noticable difference in my hair thinning problem.  My hair still falls out as much as before.  Also, I find the odor to be too strong smelling (like chemicals -- not pleasant at all).  I have cut back to just using it once a week instead of using it all the time.",1
2,Love the color and smell of the product but i think i personally may have had an allergic reaction to it. Once out of the tanning bed my skin was bright red and burning all over(only on the parts of the lotion was on) an it stayed like that for hours. I had to literally lay in the bed and not let anything touch me at all!,1
1,Disappointed at the quality of the hair. No thickness to the strands. Will have to go back to beauty supply store.,1
2,I won't procure this item again.  It failed to produce the results it indicated in the advertisement.<br />T,1
1.0,"YUCK! I am really starting to think many of these rave reviews are fake, because go on over to Makeupalley and everyone else hates this product as well. I have never in my life actually thrown away a full product, until this one. It was literally unusable. It made my face look muddy, not natural at all. And it also clumped up around my eyebrows and the sides of my face, even though I didn't use that much! It just looked so bad, I didn't feel guilty about throwing it in the garbage at all. Buy at your own risk",1
1,Was sooooo disappointed!!!! As you will notice it does not say Christian Audigier under Ed Hardy. .. This is a knock off!! Smells really bad after you spray it on and it sits awhile on you:-( guess I'll pay the $75.00 for the &#34;real&#34; stuff:-),1
2,I do not like how the powder goes all over your face and is hard to control.  It does not last all day and this color ice is too light.  I think I will stick with Buxom stay there eye shadow and Too Faced eye shadow.,1

2,"I couldn't get too excited about the cleanser.  I'm male, and this seems like it was designed for women.  It worked well, and I completely used the entire bottle.  I think face wash is very subjective, and highly personal choice.  This may be perfect for some people, it just didn't make my \\""must have\\"" list.",1
1,These things look so cute in a nail when I saw them but in real life the are annoying! They are hard to make stick to the nail and they fall off easy. I don't know it I was doing something wrong but I wouldn't waste my money on them again.,1

2,"I was expecting a little more whitening from this product. I found that it doesn't whiten as good or as quickly as it states. It did whiten some, but not satisfactory enough for me to purchase again.",1
2,"Longtime Norelco user. After replacing cutters/combs on a Norelco I'd used for two years, the quality of the replacement blades was so poor that I decided to switch to another brand. After what I hoped was adequate research, I settled on this model by Panasonic. It is very well made if just a bit heavy. The wet/dry feature is nice as using shave cream definitely improves the comfort.<br /><br />OK, now for the disappointing part. This razor does a very poor job on more than a few days growth. If you shave every day or every other day, it might be OK for you but for me, even on 1 or 2 day's growth, it was only adequate. Shaving with this razor requires an excess of facial gymnastics to cut every whisker as it seems to be very sensitive to the direction in which the hair grows. I suppose this is understandable as the combs on the cutting head are unidirectional, but the number of passes it takes to get a clean shave is excessive and frequently resulted in shaver burn when shaving dry.<br /><br />I think if you have a very round face and a very light beard this razor may work well for you. It is easy to clean and does work somewhat better, or at least more comfortably, when using shaving cream. As for me, I am returning to Norelco and hoping that whatever the reason for poor quality replacement blades has been addressed.",1

1.0,Did nothing,1
1,I did not like the product. Caps are not good for one day.,1
1,"This stuff smells like very strong flowery perfume. It also does not melt and dissolve like butter. It pulled my skin a bit and left a tacky like surface (like honey would) even after a few hours. Not soothing on already taunt skin at all. I plan on sending this back. I wish they would at the very least allow the cocoa, shea butter and aloe smells to come through. This stuff will drown out any perfume you're wearing. I liked EArth Mama Stretch Oil and Bio Oil better mixed with a bit of raw Coconut Oil.",1
1,"I have been using this product regularly for the past three years, and I love that it has a great scent, is super lightweight, and works perfectly for short hair.<br /><br />I normally buy this through my salon; however, they were out, and I was in a pinch because I was completely out of this at home, too. I thought I would save myself some time and money by buying this via Prime shipping, and thought the 15.2 oz size for the price of the 8.45 oz size was a steal - I was wrong!<br /><br />Upon opening the lid on this product, I was greeted with a smell akin to sickeningly sweet and cheap lime-aid. The feel and look of this compared to what I was used to was totally off. A quick glance at the ingredients also showed that this formula was different from my old and empty bottle, as the top herbs/scents were rosemary, thyme, grapefruit and orange INSTEAD of the usual orange, lime and peppermint.<br /><br />If you are used to this different version of the formula, good on you, but those who have used this product in the past three years, be sure to look elsewhere for the real deal.",1
1,I began using this product after having it recommended to me by my dental hygienist. From the very first time I noticed that there were little clumps in the mouthwash when I spit it out. Later I began losing my sense of taste and realized that it was actually pieces of flesh coming out with the mouth wash. I also developed painful bumps on my tongue and gums and my whole mouth felt like it had been burned by a hot drink. After an internet search I discovered that this is a common problem with this product. If I could give it less than a 1 I would. Worst product I have ever used!,1
1,"I loved this product when I ordered it direct from[...]  I was happy to see that I could get it for cheaper at Amazon through Urban Nutrition.  But, and this is a big BUT... the ingredients are not the same.  Mine did not list collagen which is one of the main reasons I bought it.  Also, they are listed in different order and are either missing or adding some.  It seems very suspicious.",1
1,"Although this was my first trimmer, I think having bought other ones makes me somewhat viable as a reviewer.      I was in the market for a \\""stubble\\"" shaver.  Basically, something that would help me achieve that shadowy/5 o'clock look.  At first glance, this shaver seems great.  It has a vacuum to help clean up, and a whole lot of settings.  Great buy, right? Wrong.      The vacuum function, although not all bad, is kind of useless, and that is really what this particular model is known for.  Okay... so instead of taking a solid minute to clean up after yourself on a non-vacuum model, you take a solid minute to empty the little basket that they give you.  Is it worth the twenty dollars extra over their other models?  Keep reading to find out.    The beard length settings are way too far apart.  2mm seems too small, while 3mm seems too long.  However, there's nothing in between, forcing you to just deal with it, I guess.      The blades on this one, for some reason, really aggravate my skin.  I've cut my upper lip more than once using this thing, and I'm a very careful user.  I initially thought this is just the way things worked with these stubble shavers.  Having bought other ones which don't nearly aggravate my skin like this one, I now think that it's a design flaw on this particular model.    Since I already bought it, and it served it's purpose to some extent, I sort of just dealt with it.  Until a month ago, about 5 months after I bought it, it would spontaneously turn on by itself.  Okay, not a big deal, just turn it off. Only happened sporadically anyway.  Then, for some reason beyond my understanding, it turned on one day and wouldn't turn off.  The \\""on\\"" button wasn't responding.  Shortly thereafter, it just died.  Wouldn't turn on at all.      I used it once a week at most.  There was actually a good three-week period in which I didn't use it at all.  But I never dropped it, immersed it in water, over-charged it, or anything of that sort.  In fact, I'm quite careful with all of my appliances and this is the first thing that's ever actually \\""died\\"" on me without any cause.      I'm willing to give Philips the benefit of the doubt and say that this might have been a lemon.  Nevertheless, the trimming function on this one is seriously sub-par.  They have other models which are far better, and much cheaper.      I don't recommend this product.  It has reliability issues and to answer my previous question about the vacuum function, it is DEFINITELY not worth the extra money, IMHO.  Good luck.",1

2,"I tried this because my normal mineral makeup by Revlon (the Colorstay foundation powder) is either discontinued or no longer sold at CVS/RiteAid hoping this would be similar. I flat out hate this product. :( The packaging is better than the Colorstay foundation (there's a little slideout brush that's super soft) so it doesn't get everywhere like the Colorstay version, but the coverage is awful. When you apply it to your skin it feels \\""wet\\"" hence the aqua name I guess. It's dry powder, but gives you the oddest sensation of wet, dewy skin, but doesn't feel wet when you touch your face afterward. The coverage is next to nothing. I almost felt like I was just putting finishing powder on my face. It's also very, very glittery. I hate glittery foundations/powders because my face is already oily. I don't need extra shine. All in all this product was very disappointing. I will be returning it and stocking up on Revlon's Colorstay instead if it is indeed being discontinued. This product gets 2 stars from me because the brush is very soft.",1

I tried another battery and it did the same thing.  I was afraid to trim my nose hairs with it because it has no power to cut hair of any type.  The light did not even work on it.

I had a cut on the joint of my pinky finger.  After the initial 10 minutes of burning and drying, it maybe lasted 30 minutes before I bent my finger and it cracked down the middle, allowing more pain and such into my cut.

Most other straighteners  have an area you can put your fingers on the open end so you are able to use two hands, this one you can't with out being burned.

1,"I used to go to an expensive salon downtown for my waxing needs and I loved the results.  Unfortunately, I ended up moving far away from the big city and could no longer afford to go have it done... because now it costs me not only money but too much time and gas to get there and back. I couldn't find a local spa that had the same type of waxing available, so I haven't gone.  I've tried all sorts of Sally Hansen products in the past few years trying to get that spa result from home, always sadly disappointed and always having to return to the awful razor, which somehow seems to be less horrible an experience than all the strips and creams and pseudo salon kits out there that I've tried to use.<br /><br />When I saw this on the shelf my inner voice was screaming \\""NO!  DON'T FALL FOR IT!\\""  But I was tired of razor burns and angry red bumps, and I did so miss the neat, smooth results of salon waxing, and fell for the promise on the box, totally confident this time it would work.<br /><br />I'm one of the unlucky ones that had the warmer that does not function properly.  Finally, after hours of poking and prodding and waiting, I took the tin downstairs and heated it on my stove burner.  I hurried back upstairs and began what would soon become the most horrific 5 hours of my life.  I can NOT get this stuff off me!  Part would rip off the hair in a neat little strip as it is supposed to do, lending me enough promise to keep trying... but it would leave chunks of broken wax adhered all over along the edges, on my skin. I tried to apply wax over that to pick it up, and what resulted was leaving behind even more debris and wax that would not come up. I tried using the fabric strips from another past, failed home wax kit and that helped some but still would leave behind horrific clumps of sticky wax. Perhaps my skin is just the wrong type... I don't know... but hour after hour I slipped more maddeningly into remorse and desperation and finally I tried to shave the s*** off of me, and all hair that it was stuck to, because no amount of picking and pulling and baby oil was saving my soul at that point.  I still have residual sticky on my skin.  My skin is enraged and irritated from all the abuse of trying to get the residual wax off.  The wax is under my fingernails and on my fingers and I've washed and scrubbed and picked and oiled right on into today and I have yet to rid myself of the horrors of this experience. To make matters even worse, I was wearing a fuzzy black bathrobe which somehow managed to stick to whatever residual stickiness is left all over me so now I look like I have grotesque, fuzzy moles everywhere.

2,"Shea Cashmere Hand Cream features African Shea Butter, known for its excellent moisturizing, as well as Mongolian Cashmere Extract, which imparts a smooth silky feeling on skin. However, after digging out my reading glasses, I noted that these two ingredients were a ways down on the ingredients list.  This was a little bit disappointing, as typically I'd hope for them to bit closer to the top, meaning a higher concentration.<br /><br />On the positive side, the scent of Shea Cashmere Hand Cream is very nice. In the tube it has a sweet vanilla scent, but when applied to my hands, it smells more rich and nutty. It's subtle and not too heavy, a nice change from some of the more heavily scented Signature hand creams I'd been using. The scent does last for a few hours as well, so it's a good choice for women who prefer to use scented hand creams over cologne or perfume.<br /><br />Shea Cashmere Hand Cream isn't as thick in consistency as the Signature line hand creams. This is not necessarily bad, though, as it makes it a bit easier to squeeze from the tube, while still having a nice rich consistency that I look for in a hand cream. I often apply hand cream while I'm at a stop light while driving and the last thing I want is a runny hand lotion that gets all over the place.<br /><br />I also felt it absorbed a bit more quickly than the Signature hand creams, as it takes very little effort to rub it in. Of course, this is nice when I'm driving as it doesn't feel as sticky and I don't worry about my hands being slippery on the steering wheel.<br /><br />However, the big issue is its lack of moisturizing. I look for hand creams to provide some long term moisturizing as well as healing of dryness and rough skin. While my skin is not super dry, the harsh, cold winters of Colorado can suck all the moisture out of my skin if I'm not careful and diligent about using a good hand cream. I felt that all Shea Cashmere Hand Cream really does is make my skin feel smoother. An hour after application my skin, particularly around my knuckles, felt as dry as ever. Clearly this is not a therapeutic or healing hand cream for those with dry to very dry skin.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing Shea Cashmere Hand Cream again. Despite its high price tag, it's a below average product when it comes to healing and protecting my skin. While I love its scent, I'd be better off with their Signature line hand creams. 2 stars only.er application my skin, particularly around my knuckles, felt as dry as ever.

2,"I'm giving it two stars because, well, because of the instructions to put it simply. I loved it for use on my body, and it made my face cry tears of insane red blistery mitten-sadness.....  And here is why.....<br /><br />I purchased this to be used on my body, but as WELL as on my face as the product explicitly states that it \\""removes blackheads\\"" etc. and is intended for use on the face.<br /><br />I THOROUGHLY read through the instructions, as well as the emails I received before I even got the product. It does say to be weary of the amount of pressure you use in sensitive skin areas, but does not explicitly state a duration of time for use or how to use on your face.... so I went at it.<br /><br />Info: I exfoliate REGULARLY, I am not a newbie. And my skin is very resilient, I would never ever consider it 'sensitive' or 'thin' or 'mature' skin that I would take caution with. In fact, I throw pretty much anything at it and it's fine....<br /><br />The email instructions state you should 'not see large rolls of skin come off your face as you would other areas of your body, but you should still feel small balls of skin'. And I didn't, so I kept rubbing... And then I thought, you know, this isn't working at all. I don't have any skin \\""balls\\"" coming off my face at all....<br />So then I tried it on my body, and it DID work. I thought eh maybe it was just my face.<br /><br />Yeah. No.<br />A few hours later my skin was HOT, red, buuuuuuuuuuuurning and I felt the intense feeling of \\""ohhhhh ***** what happened here\\"" .... I woke up this morning and I had to go to make an emergency dermatologist visit because not only does it appear that I have \\""rug burn\\"" alllllllllll over my face, but the top layer of skin is basically gone in some areas of my face.<br /><br />Let's just say the derm looked at me, said \\""Oh wow. Well, we can fix this\\"" and I left with a prescription to help heal it, maybe in a week she said. Yaaaaaaay.<br /><br />So while it worked good on my body, I have to say that I would be PETRIFIED to use it on my face EVER again. Maybe it's my skin, maybe it was the length of time I exfoliated for, but all I know is that my face BURNS and HURTS and it's all because of a mitten.<br /><br />***EDITED TO YPDATE******<br />I actually replied to the seller's email asking me if I'd received my mitten and explained that I received a huge gigantic ouchie mess of face from the mitten. She offered apologies and sent me a \\""lite\\"" version to use on my face.<br />Now, I haven't used the mitten on my face again, nor the Lite version as I haven't yet gotten it, but the customer service was at least well done as she even offered some natural remedies for my freak-face condition. (which healed in just over 5 days)<br /><br />But with that being said, I am still scared of trying it again on my face.....<br /><br />And for those who wanted to know - it didn't actually hurt that badly when I was scrubbing, which is the scary part. It was obviously VERY easy for me to over-do it... Granted I DO have a VERY high pain tolerance, but I also expected a slight stinging as the instructions state it could feel 'red or tingly' from the exfoliation...",1

2,"This product is simply ok. I have oily acne prone skin and I am a 30 yr old African-American woman. This product was recommended to me after a facial. It is mainly alcohol and sometimes will sting as it over dries your skin. I did still breakout consistently though it did help to slightly reduce my cystic acne so that is why 2 stars and not 1. I tried the whole Skinceauticals line for adult acne and honestly it was very harsh on my face which I was ok with but it did not work and for the price it should be working. Honestly I used to think the pricer products must be better but after using some of the pricey products out there like chanel, kate sommervile, dermalogica, clinique, erno laszlo and every other counter in nordstroms. I realized that expensive was not always better. As none of them worked or if they did it didnt last.<br />I really wanted this product to work but now my face regime in total including the extra masks I use once a week is under 150 and my skin has never look better. I am embarrassed to say I have products that alone cost over $60 US. But after none of them worked I changed up my whole routine. I dont want to be too long so if you would like to know more then just post a comment and I will answer but in brief now after 15 years of acne, black heads, white heads, hyperpigmentaiton and acne scars my skin in almost clear. Then only dietary change I made was drink the daily requirement of water but even when I dont get enough water, which i know is awful, my skin still doesnt break out. Where as before breakouts were my norm.<br />So now I use Cetaphil DermaControl Foaming Cleanser (with dessert essence which is scrubber like clarisonic only older so its durable but thats only at night) then I use Cure Natural Gel, then i do a quick cleans with the cetaphil again but this time no scrubber. Next I use a toner I mis myself which is apple cider vinegar and thayers rose witchahzel (which is not harsh). I pat this toner in then at night I put on a super light layer of clearsil ultra rapid 4 hour cream. This is really a spot cream but to get my skin under control I had to use it all over my face for alittle. BUT this is very drying so next when I do put it all over my face I put on Laniege Water sleeping mask which is on amazon or target. When I wake up my skin looks amazing. In the morning thou after my toner I use the cetaphil dermacontrol moisturizer which helps to treat acne, control oil and has an spf only use this light. 15yrs of acne is almost over. Hope this helps. Oh an I also use an a light eyecream. I have a bunch of samples so I use whatever is on hand.<br />You cant wear this if you are going to be in the sun.",1

I was quite disappointed.<br /><br />I gave the Norelco 8040X a solid week of use, thinking that it might get better over time (as their manual suggests).  It did not.<br /><br />Every morning after shaving I had to manually touch-up using a $2 Bic razor.  This product did not come anywhere near my skin no matter how light or hard I pressed it against me.  Maybe that's just how electric shavers are?  I'm not sure, but they can't be this bad.<br /><br />I was however impressed with the battery life (a full week on a single charge) and how quiet it is.  With the shower running, I could barely hear the motor.  It's waterproof, so I can use it in the shower.  It comes with a nice travel case.<br /><br />The sideburn attachment is a nice thought, but there was no ear/nose trimmer which I have seen in $20 Norelco sets.<br /><br />As for the moisturizing part, the lotion smelled nice but it didn't really add to the experience.

1,"I happened to pick this up from Walmart because they didnt have my regular deep conditioner. Boy was I surprised........I had not heard about the reviews on this prodct before buying it and I had also used Pantene products in the past but they did nada for my hair. This however was theeeeee BEST THING I HAD EVER USED on my hair and I'm a product junkie who has used plenty of brands!! I didnt even deep condition, I just washed then conditioned with this in the shower and the results were amazing. My hair held its moisture once it was (air) dried and flat-ironed. Also I always had strands of hair breaking off into the sink....it virtually stopped....I can not keep my hands out of my freakin hair. I have relaxed hair with a semi-perm black hair dye....please don't sleep on this, I checked the message boards and this product is on fire, I would say 4 out of 5 sista's are SUPER pleased with this item...chicks are even asking each other where to find it cause the constant complaint is everytime we go out to buy theres always like zero or like two jars available....Pantene finally got it right for the women of color, cause I havent used anything from their regular line of products thats done a dang thing for my hair and just wrote them off as a one of the many brand of products that wasn't sister friendly. Now they need start pumpin out more jars so they're available.....until then I'll be buying the multi pack from Amazon.<br /><br />UPDATE: If you've read my other reviews on Pantene then you know we have a rocky relationship. They changed the formula rendering this conditionder useless.",1
2,These things are so cheap. Already cracked after just less than a month..,1
1,"I wish you were able to put no stars as a review! First off They did not resembled the ones in the picture. They are not silicone lined.  I picked these micro beads out of all the other micro beads because they were affordable in the also were supposably silicone lined. I am disappointed with this purchase. the silicone is there to protect your hair. For all the people who are okay with not having it still a the silicone is there to protect your hair. For all the people who are okay with not having it silicone, you are not aware of what damage your causing.",1
1,"I bought these heads in good faith from the above company.  They don't work as well as my worn out heads.  They leave a stubble beard. There are several other reviews regarding the poor quality of these heads.       I returned them and BIN refused to refund the shipping charge $1.79 postage, $7.16 shipping).  This company is a scammer.  They keep $7 profit on each item returned.  Good business model!    Amazon apparently doesn't get involved although this practice is a reflection on them.  Up to now I have been very satisfied with Amazon;  I just don't understand their stance in this matter.",1
1,This hair was HORRIBLE! It shedded way too much. I had hair everywhere. There were synthetic fibers in it. Not all human hair. Tangled too much as well.,1
2,Actually I thought it smaller but its tall so I could not use it for thick perfumes or oud to keep it in my handbag,1

2,"When this was shipped, most of the bottles leaked out and the box was a mess.  The smell is too perfumely.  Not as described.",1
2.0,Needs a lot of coats to get the right color. It's awfully light for a gel polish.,1
1.0,"I used this product with a 'breast growth activating massage technique' for three months(again, not wanting to give up after the first bottle) , every morning and every night. No results. It was less the money I spent on it that made me mad, as the time I spent using the product and making sure the product was dry before dressing, washing before using the product, ensuring my bra wasn't too tight to allow them to grow, not eating starchy foods ( read it online along with watching the correct massage technique), etc etc. Frustrating. Now in order to do something about the sag after several children, my options are filling them with silicone or having skin removed for a lift.",1
2,"Be careful when ordering this. It has a &#34;B&#34; after the number for the &#34;pink&#34; color, but also this lipstick had almost like a chemical taste to it and waxy feel. Possibly expired.",1
1,"So I sent a family member to the store for refill blades for my regular razor. They were out of the refill blades.  The family member sees a &#34;lady razor&#34; on sale and purchases it for me thinking they are being fantastically wonderfully nice with a new razor.<br /><br />My hands haven't been small enough to properly make use of this item since grade school. I understand that different people are built differently and that I may have abnormally large hands...but this is just ridiculously small and unmanageable. It's like trying to write with a stubby pencil...yes, you CAN, but it's not as effective.",1
1,"This was a very disappointing shave when I went to shave my chest, your better off just getting a Wahl shaver and living with stubble instead of a smooth chest ! Save your money !",1
2,Doesn't work.,1
1,"This mirror fogged up the first time I used it and has done so faithfully every time since. The suction cups don't work so the mirror regularly falls on the shower floor, usually in the middle of the night. The clock doesn't work anymore...probably from the hits on the shower floor. This is all within six weeks after purchase. This deserves a \\""0\\"" rating, is a total waste of time and money and is just a lousy product.",1
2,Ugh... the material was cheap. The &#34;metal&#34; gold parts you see in the picture are actually plastic. I wish I hadn't bought this. :I,1
2,"I had this in my cart to purchase, $15 is a pretty good price. I found out my tanning salon had a $1.95 sample packet (big enough for about 3 full body applications), so I bought one there to try. Wow. I'm glad I tried it before buying....I found this lotion underwhelming. I suppose I thought the smell might be a little more perfume-y like Juicy Couture. It's just plain peach. It smells JUST LIKE the old Body Drench peach lotion from the 90's that the manicurist used to use on my hands :P Not a bad smell, but a bit too little girl-y on a 34 year old woman. The lotion, itself, is okay. It's not greasy, which is a plus. It isn't very moisturizing, though, as a result. Not as much as, say, my Melaluca Renew lotion. The thinner than expected consistency, coupled with the disappointing scent, led me to delete this item from my cart.",1
1,Waste of money,1
1.0,"I use this with Redken hairspray and Big Sexy texturizing powder, but it doesn't seem to tease very well.",1

1,"I been using this shower gel, for the past 10 years and I believe this is not the same, the bottle changed, witch I don't mind, but the gel is not 4711, not even close, is like using a unsent soap",1
1,"The colors look great in the bottle, but not only is there not much pigmentation, it's very sticky, and the applicator leaves something to be desired. It's just 2 holes. one per color. I think this was intended so that you could use one color at a time, or both. You squeeze the soft tubes and out splooges color. What happens though, is the part that goes on your lips is a concave piece of plastic. This ends up leaving product behind to crust up on the plastic. I don't recommend this product at all.",1
1,"This was a gift for my daughter--she LOVES it! Very well made, well-fitting, and covered in nicely cut rhinestones. Sparkly!",1
2,"I bought this after winning a Super Bowl bet. I wish I would have spent a little extra money and gotten a better product. The wax refirms to quickly, and the wax remover cream does NOT work! We tried everything to remove the excess wax, but with no success. I would never buy this product again!",1
1,The bottles I received were mismatched with inconsistent text and labels printed off center in different types of ink.  Either these are knock-off versions of the original or samples discarded by the manufacturer for quality control issues.  But either way I do not trust that the product that was sent to me is legitimate.,1
2,"this reminds me of the lip sticks that came in little girls makeup sets<br />I wouldn't recommend them, however, they're fun to play with with my little one.",1
1,"Doesn't stay on, middle strap is much higher than regular bra. I got it to wear with low cut shirts that show my regular bra and it was totally useless. Sticky side sticks to other lingerie but it's just like going braless but with an annoying clip in the middle.",1
1,"These have too thin of plastic and broke after two days of use.  decided not to return them as they were so cheap anyways, and shipping might have been more than what I paid for them.  You get what you pay for, I guess.",1
2.0,"I thought that the shadow would be a little more \\""rich,\\"" but it came out sort of dried up and chunky, not smooth at all. The colors were definitely not what I was hoping for, but I won't mark off for my inability to properly judge appropriate eye color, however, the quality of the product wasn't nearly what I would have hoped for. Maybe best for an 80's night or maybe I need a makeup class. Either way, I think I'll stick to my Urban Decay Naked Palette and not scare the neighbors.",1
2,"This leaves my hair with a weird feeling like too much something in it yet I use less then a dime size. Love TIGI products, but not this one!!",1
2,"I loved the smell initially, but the sweetness of this oil got to me after a few minutes. It was overwhelming so I had to wash my hair soon after I put it on.  I had to give it away to a friend who could tolerate it.",1
1,Beware that this is advertised as a 4 ounce size but I received a 2.9 oz size with a 4 oz sticker.,1
1,"I've only used this once and was not impressed.  I used it on my legs and have course thick hair.  It did not remove all of the hair, in fact perhaps only about 30% of it over an extended amt of time...25min.  Perhaps, I need to use a larger quantity of it, but then this bottle will be done in about 4 applications.",1
2,"This cream looked old when I received it.  The pump stopped working every two pumps.  Even when I unscrewed the cap and moved it around, the pump just didn't work.  I've only used it a week, and now the pump has completely stopped working.  I just take off the cap, but the stick is so tiny that it's not that great at removing the sunscreen.  UGH!!!  Not worth the money.  If it works, I wouldn't know.  I can barely get enough out to use.  I would give it a zero for usability, but since it didn't make me break out, I think two stars is fair.",1
1,"This product is not the same serum I bought from OTA merchandise July 25,2012.  I have used this wonderful serum for 7 -8 years, and I am offended that this company does not think I recognize the difference in the smell,texture and color.  I realize that color and thickness does change as it ages.  I have no desire to just &#34;be complaining&#34;.  I just wanted to be able to begin using a quality product .  So now I need to go buy it at a spa.  I am not happy.",1
1,"This device is awful.  What I now realize is light use (2/3 of a reservoir used twice a day by one person) runs the battery down in 3 days, after 3 months of use.  Initially the charge would last about 5 or 6 days, but no more.  I hate this thing -- the recharge period is so long (16 hours) that I can't use it every 6th or 8th time that my dentist recommends that I do so.  In addition, it is so much longer compared to other chargers that I use for my cellphone, blackberry, rechargeable batteries for flashlights and shower and other portable radios, that I have actually seen my electric bill increase.  DO NOT BUY THIS!  I have replaced it with a standard water pik that plugs into the wall.",1
1,Not what I expected.  Does not smell like apricots at all smells like it's medicated.  Will not purchase again.,1
2,"Totally overpriced product, and do not understand what the hype is all about, even  went to the local Sephora store , tried different shades and it seemed to have mad no difference of creating a radiant touch , or luminous glow to my face .<br />Really tried to like this product since many gave it great reviews, but also for the very high price I can do without.",1
2,"Doesn't lighten as well as it says on the box. Smells awful ,as to be expected with most hair dyes. My hair was liht brown, didn't get much lighter after use.",1
1,"Waste of money. My favorite scent in piña colada and I'd found a piña colada body spray at my job and LOVED it but want a perfume for a longer lasting scent, since body sprays wear off faster than perfumes. First off, this perfume smells different in the bottle than it does on your body. Smelling it from the bottle, it smells good. But when I actually put it on, it smells nothing like piña colada. Smells sour and has an &#34;oily, perfumey&#34; smell to it when I apply it. But nothing like what I wanted it to smell like (nothing like my piña colada body spray).  Plus the bottle is extremely small. Disappointed!",1
1,"I had high hopes after reading the reviews of this product.  I really wanted something that would help shrink my pores at night, and hopefully even my skin tone.  I wasn't too thrilled at all the ingredients (I tend to prefer more natural stuff when it will work for me).  This product was a little heavy for my skin, but it smelled nice.  However, afte I started using it, I began to get the biggest cysts I had ever seen.  I mean huge.  They would start deep under the skin and take days to emerge.  They were incredibly painful, and always resulted in a huge white head.  In fact, many of them had multiple heads!  YUCK!!!  After I stopped using this product I no longer had this problem, so I know for sure there was a direct correlation.  I normally have acne prone skin, but I have never had such huge, painful cysts in my life.  I tried giving it a few weeks, since I know that for some products there's a &#34;breaking in&#34; period where your skin has to get used to the new stuff. But, finally, I couldn't stand the huge pimples any more, so I tossed this junk in the trash!  I'm happy it works so well for other people, but be warned it may give you nightmare pimples!",1
1,"I suppose this works well to stop razor burn, relieve your skin, etc., but what little scent it does have smells to me like fresh plastic. I used it twice before throwing the bottle away.",1
1,"I tried this product different ways to try to make it work. I tried it with a heavy hand, I tried very little, I tried large sections, I tried small sections, I tried it with other products, I tried it alone and NONE OF IT WORKED. I give up. I will give the rest of this away. Every time I tried this, I had hard, unmanageable hair. The Souffle smells like heaven and my hair was SUPER SOFT while it was wet, but once it dried, it was crunchy and tangly. Will NEVER buy this product again.",1
1.0,Did not like it at all . It stings and lipstick doesn't stay on like it says,1
2,"The lavender smell is very overpowering.  I thought the smell would go away after a few minutes, but it didn't.  This would be a great product if it came without a scent.",1
1,Junk. Get better quality item.,1
1,"I was really disappointed with the condition of this product.  The small box holding the mascara was damaged and closed with dirty tape. Upon opening the box, the mascara was dusty and appeared to have a large powder smudge on it.  The mascara was visibly very old, smelled bad, and is basically unusable.",1
1,Terrible hair !!!  The Best thing about the hair was the price.,1
1,WHY do companies change the ingredients in long-time favorites? This soap smells so bad I had to air out the bathroom. It smells like industrial-strength floor cleaner. And the chemicals in the ingredients! What were they thinking?,1
1,I am only giving it a star because i have to. I am so upset with this product! So! Upset! I have only used it twice. I have naturally thick hair (I'm African American) but my hair ended up thinning at the crown because I had it in a ponytail so much and I used this 2 times! I'm too lazy to blow dry my hair so after my shower I kept it in a towel for a few hours then decided to comb it. Literally! CLUMPS OF HAIR were knotetd at the roots and I combed it and chunks ...CHUNKS of my hair were being pulled out in knots! OMG! -__- it's caused my hair to break off alllll the time since so I'm afraid to get it relaxed and I am reluctant to use heat on it minus the dryer :(,1
1,I hate for 2 times,1
1,This comb is very flimsy and doesn't do a good job at teasing. I thought I'd try this out because it was inexpensive but it isn't worth the price at all. Would not recommend.,1
1,"I first purchased a small bottle of this at the beauty supply store and I loved it. It didn't lather very much which I think is best for hair. Lather is really just for show and irritates the hair shaft making the hair more frizzy and fluffy (very bad for wavy / curly hair).  I then bought a large bottle here on Amazon and something was different. The stuff i bought on Amazon foamed a lot more, which this shampoo shouldn't do. It just seemed different. So, i stuck it out and used up this large bottle, and then went to the beauty supply store to buy a new bottle. Again, there was a huge difference in lather and the way my hair looked after. That is just my experience.",1
2,This eyeliner was weird. It looks like it's supposed to be dark and shimmery but it just ends up looking like you've applied it unevenly. The applicator also doesn't seem to work well.,1
1,"Terrible scent - similar to how liquid tooth filler prep stinks in the dental office! Didn't plump my lips at all. It can be used as a lip gloss, but the stench gave me a headache, so couldn't use it as a lip gloss either. Shocked at all other positive reviews, - definitely something fishy about them.",1
1,"I only used this twice. The fragrance in it is so strong it gives me a headache. It's my fault that I was too busy to notice I could have returned it, which I wish I would have done. If you are sensitive at all to fragrances, this is not for you. Plus, it makes my hair dull and lifeless.",1
1,Got ripped off! Thought 4 was coming in the mail and only got 1!,1
2,The face wash leaves a bad burning sensation around my eyes but this would be different from person to person depending on their skin type!,1
1,"After waiting for this to arrive at my house...I went to open a bottle to use, It was scotch taped shut. This is not how you buy them at Bath and Body Works.. It states on your page that it is NEW that is not the case. Thanks but no thanks For the Classy Shop",1
2,"I figured I'd try this one since I love the other Almay Oil-Free makeup remover pads and this one was cheaper and it's new, but I don't like it.  Wish I would've stuck to my oil-free one.  This one leaves a residue behind and it didn't get rid of all my mascara.  Have to wash hands afterwards also cause have it all over my hands also.  Wont buy this one again.  Next time I'll stick with the oil-free pads also from Almay.",1
1,"I bought both the shampoo and conditioner hoping to see more rapid growth in my hair. Not only were the products unsuccessful in that task, they both increased the buildup in my hair and it took weeks to get the buildup off of my scalp. NO. NO. NO. Cheap and just no.",1
2,"I would not buy again. Personally, I did not like it , but that's just me. It's suppose to be really good, I like soap that lathers.",1
2,"The beard trimmer works okay for a low priced item.  The ear/nose trimmer makes noise as if it is working, but it won't cut a single hair. If this won't bother you, I guess it's okay to purchase.",1
2,Smells great but it barely comes off the roller dispenser. What's the point? At least let the perfume come out.,1
1,This product was terrible.,1
2,I thought they were at least hold up a few weeks bit as soon as I took the out and touched the tip the hairs started falling.......there where a few like the eyeliner brush and lip brush which where synthetic hairs that actually do work.....,1
1,Very disappointed no instructiuons were included for a beginner,1
2.0,"This candle is good quality and it came on time. Unfortunately, it smells like a combination of Simple Green and old lady, drugstore perfume. I've been burning it in my bathroom, but I think I can't stand it anymore, I'm just going to throw it away.",1

2,"In my experience, this product is a great cleanser, but not as good a shaving cream. No matter how I prepared my face (washed, even right out of the shower), I had problems with skin cuts in a bumpy area around my chin. I use a safety razor, which is admittedly more aggressive than a disposable razor. I went back to using Gillette Proglide Gel and experienced no problems. As always, YMMV.",1
1,"Drop of Essence is a great product.  I usually buy it at a retail store.  First I noticed that instead of the usual pump action that is &#34;air tight&#34; in its design there is now a tube down through the product which appears to pump the product.  Secondly I noticed that the container didn't seem to be full either at the top or the bottom.... how odd I thought.  Lastly, when I went to use it the pump didn't work at all.  Disappointed YES!",1
2.0,"I like the scent and wanted to love this product, but this dried out my hair making it more unruly and difficult to style. It has been relegated to the guest bathroom emergency stock.",1

1,"Very mediocre shampoo that does nothing useful to prevent hair loss. It does not smell nice either.<br />I read a few good reviews, so I was hopeful for something more potent.",1
1,"I agree 100% with the previous review of this product.  My jar also arrived with no<br />inner seal and there was no moisture to the product whatsoever.. It may be fine if<br />you can get one that is sealed and not dried out.

2,"i tried using this mask twice and twice it began to burn my face. so i had to wash it off after a minute. my skin was turning red :( so i have decided to use this diluted mixed in with my face wash as a gentle exfoliate and with some homemade face masks. i don't have sensitive skin and have never reacted to a product this way before. but i don't think its a horrible product either, its just very strong.",1
2,very uncomfortable to use,1
1,"I love most of elf's products for their cheap (if bought in store or directly from their site) prices and the fact that they don't test on animals, but this was awful in my experience.<br />I almost feel bad for leaving a review since I never wore the product, but it's because it was impossible to do so. As soon as I opened it, the liner had solidified completely and was unusable. My first clue should have been that it had condensed into a little pellet significantly smaller than its container. I've had gel liners dry up on me before, but never have I had one that was unusable upon purchase. I tried digging through the surface a little, thinking the inside of the pellet would be soft enough for a brush, but nope.<br />I'm sure I just had an unlucky experience as most people here have positive reviews, but I know I'm not alone on this and I figured I should warn everyone of the possibility. Especially if you plan to pay this ridiculous price on Amazon.",1
2.0,Leaves my beard very dry and tangled.  One of the driest shampoos I've ever used and doesn't lather up every well.  It makes a conditioner have to work overtime.  Bluebeards original beard wash with extra conditioning is the better way to go.  I will not buy this product again.,1
1,"Shows little to no effect on whitening. If any effects at all, it only last couple days at most before going back to normal. Another effect is make your teeth very sensitive, I would stay away from this as much as you can.",1
2,"Yes, this flosser does work fine but don't expect it to charge 7-10 months from now. We've had two of these and that's about how long they each lasted. (We thought maybe the first one was a bad apple but both failed after several months). Also, for me I always felt like I was racing to floss before the tank emptied. I would have to fill it twice but always felt time pressure to beat the tank.<br /><br />Before you buy, ask yourself if you really must have the cordless model. If not buy the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser instead. It is corded but I love it for the following reasons:<br />- the tank is about 3 times bigger and I now take my time flossing<br />- the pressure settings are great since you can get it 'just right'<br />- it's much,much easier to hold the small wand attached to base than it is to hold the gigantic cordless machine<br />- it only costs a few dollars more<br />The corded model takes a little more counter space but not much more.

2,"I purchased this item because one of my Snorepins broke, and I wanted to try a similar product for comparison purposes.  I don't like the even, tube-like shape of this product and found it difficult to insert comfortably high enough up into my nostrils.  The cylindrical shape of my old Snorepin is much more comfortable, with the smaller diameter side being inserted quite easily deep into the nose.  I don't like the somewhat flimsy texture of this product.  The two smaller sizes included in the package are easy enough to maneuver into the nose due to the added firmness associated with the smaller circumference of the nosepiece.  The two larger nosepieces in the set are floppier due to the larger circumference, thereby making them more difficult to maneuver into the nose.  The added floppiness of the two larger nosepieces renders them almost ineffective at being able to hold the nostrils open to the desired degree to aid breathing and/or stop snoring.  Another reviewer mentioned condensation with this product, and I do feel that my nose feels more &#34;wet&#34; while using this product.  I don't experience additional moisture with my old Snorepin that has a caged design.  Regarding snoring, I find that this product, the Snorepin, and similar products don't help my snoring at all, but they do aid in keeping my nostrils open so I can breathe and sleep better.  Some people might find this particular item comfortable, but I do not and will not purchase it again.",1
1,Somehow this product just disapates if you don't use it!!  I loved the smell but I can't have a product simply disappear because I do not use it.  Never heard of such a thing happening.,1

In that it is surely compact, it is an excellent product. However, as the previous reviewer stated, the lowest setting is far too weak to dry in a reasonable amount of time, and seconds after initiating the second setting the unit smells like it may be burning.

1.0,I ordered this product online and did not open within 30 days of purchasing.  Now that I have opened it and a key piece is missing they do not honor sending the missing piece because it is not within their 30 day window.  May I suggest you not order from this seller or at least open anything you have ordered right away.  It's pretty tough to use the product when there is no bowl included to hold the water.,1
1,Does not work,1
1,"UPDATED REVIEW - this eyeliner gave me a HORRIBLE rash on both my eyes after wearing it. My eyes puffed up terribly. I thought maybe it was something else so a couple months later I used it again and got a rash NEXT TO MY EYE. Can't stress enough how awful this reaction is. I would strongly advise against purchasing.   Previous review.  It's not the best eyeliner, it doesn't have great staying power, you have to reapply. I have stopped using it because I dont have a pencil sharpener lol. The colour was darker than I expected but it's still nice.",1
2,As a product it is one of my favorites however the packaging was almost nonexistent and the conditioner broke open and leaked all over the box and even leaked out the box on to my porch. Received a refund from amazon as they were not able to replace the item.,1
2,Ojon is usually excellent. This shampoo is not :c( Doesn't even smell nice. Better to stay with Volumizing Shampoo instead.,1
1.0,"It doesn't really rub in so you have a white film allover you. Not sure how well it works, because I had to wipe it off.",1
1,Never received what was advertised so I have no idea how it works,1
2,I'm afraid to even try it on.  I know it will rip,1
1,"These were too big for the 7&#34; Kindle Fire I purchased. Tried to trim them down to fit, but ended up throwing them out.",1
1,"The product is great. However, Amazon shows it listed as $59.00 for a 1oz bottle, when in fact, it costs $46.50/1oz if you buy it at Estee Lauder's website directly, or at a department store. In fact, if you watch closely, every department store tends to have gift promotions along with a purchase, especially this time of the year. So, you can get your full size product for the same price and an entire gift bag worth over $50 of other EL goodies. Get more for your money and buy elsewhere. You're not saving anything by buying it here. Amazon shouldn't falsey claim that you are saving 21%!",1
1,"I order this thinking it would be perfect for my facial needs.  Unfortunately, it only worked once.  I think the manufacture needs to research the product and improve quality control.  It would have been nice if the product had also included batteries.  Maybe what I got was used equipment sold as new.",1
1,"I wanted to give this product zero starts (but wasn't allowed so please ignore the one star) and think women should be warned from using this flat iron...on wet hair. I followed the instructions carefully and was left with hair that was frizzy, resembles straw and with about a zillion split ends. I normally use an ion dryer and an expensive ceramic iron to straighten my wavy/curly medium-thick hair. So I welcomed the opportunity to eliminate the step of blow drying. Besides getting a mini steam facial while straightening my hair there was no other upside.    I used this once and will need to get my hair cut now! I am so angry that I felt I should warn people. Mine is going in the garbage!    Don't use this product if you want shiny straight hair. If you LIKE looking like a frizzed mess, then this is the product for you. Buyer beware!",1
1,It came in a small bottle and  I was anxious to use it. I do not like the sprayer because it sprays too much product in one spot and it feels like spraying J&J Baby Oil. I will not buy again for this price. It is not worth more than $10. I 'll continues looking for another product.,1
1,"I purchased these drops after having used Refresh Optive Sensitive (single use vials) to recover from LASIK surgery.  Unfortunately the preservative in the non-sensitive type did not work out for me, eyes would develop mucus soon after using and blur my vision.  Eyes also felt drier and more irritated after using the product than before.",1
2,not as pretty in person as it is in the pics,1
1,"I read some other reviews and apparently the 14 hour lipstick stays on for a few people, but came off for many more. That's a mystery. I let it dry a short time then ate lunch and poof it was faded to almost nothing. I tried it again later and it came off again. I wondered if I was doing something wrong, but there were no instructions. If you don't want to take the chance, consider not buying in the first place.",1
2,Being bored of using Head & Shoulders I wanna use some different shampoo for treating my dandruff. I read only positive reviews about this product and bought this product. I used for 3 washes. I see all flakes falling on my face and sticking upon my hair instead. I suffered severe hair loss for that two weeks. I was shocked to see bunch of my hair on my pillow when I woke up. Dint work for me.<br />Worst experience!,1
1,"I've been using this for about 2 weeks now, mostly once a day. I switched over from proglide 5 razor shaving as it was tearing up my neck hoping for a convenient solution. This product was not the solution. I have to go every which way about 20 times to get 80% of the hairs, 20 % do not come out no matter what I do unless I resort to my old razor and that simply isn't good enough. It just completely fails at getting any hair that isn't perfectly set up for it to grab.<br /><br />I will be trying it for 1 more week before attempting to return it.",1
2,"Neither Waterproof nor Smudgeproof! Very messy to apply also; was looking for a product that lasted, still have not found!",1
2,"I still had to use conditioner afterward,  I went back to Suave shampoo and conditioner and this was thrown away half used.",1
1,"I used this cream twice. The first time only applying it to the dark spots and leaving it on for 5 minutes. The next night I put on all over both my cheeks, and left it on over night (which was probably stupid) but it burned my skin, leaving me red for a full week, and then just darkened the entire area that the cream had been applied to. So now not only are my dark spots still there, but I have larger dark spots from this cream.",1
1.0,"SO disappointed!! It looks so pretty, but its actually only shimmery/ sparkly on the outermost layer then the rest of the eye shadow underneath is nothing how it looks on the outside. It's like there is a thin coat of sparkle on the outside :(  so sad because it was exactly what I wanted.",1
1,I would love to review the product but I have not got it yet .It has been over a month now still waiting.,1
1,My hair seems very dry after using this product but that is not the worse part. Even after 4 washings now the dye still is coming off on the towel and my clothing. I have even found it on my pillow case in the morning. When I sweat it drips color on my neck and forehead. Are you kidding me?,1
1,These creams... they just don't work. Even temporarily. It's all about toning and losing a LOT of your fat to reduce.,1
1,"The soap when wet and used has little suds or seeming cleansing properties, rather it seems oily and almost worthless to use on the body.  I want to return the product as an exchange.",1
2,Difficult to use.,1
2,"did not care for the color,other wise its alright",1
2,"I have used Tom's of Maine toothpaste for about 20 years, but am now switching to another brand; Tom's which now belongs to Colgate Palmolive, has ditched its original very simple formulation in favor of a much more commercial and synthetic formulation.  Fennel flavor has been my favorite, and until now I've been reliably cheered to read the very simple list of ingredients on the tube.  Now, however, the list has changed, and includes all sorts of ingredients -- xylitol (a sweetener), sodium laurel sulfate, and \\""natural flavors\\"" -- that I don't want in my toothpaste.  No more propolis, no more myrrh.  \\""Natural flavors\\"", thanks to the FDA, means chemically synthesized flavors that match those derived from natural substances.  That means that you get a fake jolt of fennel, or mint, or wintergreen, not the real thing.  \\""Natural flavors\\"" is a cheaper alternative to real flavors, and lets Colgate Palmolive manufacture a paste that suggests a healthy alternative to more mainstream brands, while not actually being significantly different from those brands.",1
2,I would not buy this product again. It leave a wax build up as do so many others. Still looking for a better solution.,1
1,this stuff just flat out sucked!  No moisture at all!,1
1,"I've had good luck with other fine soaps on Amazon, so I followed the five-star reviews here and bought this one blindly.  Mistake!  This isn't a fresh citrus scent -- it smells like bug spray!  And not the bug spray they sell in the supermarkets today, with strong fruity fragrances cloaking the underlying chemical.  This soap smells like old-school, roll-on OFF! bug repellent.  My wife made me put it away as soon as she sniffed it.  We're back to using Dial pump soap.  Blech.",1
2,"I got 2, maybe 3 used out of these, then they went dull.  I oiled it and cleaned it out; took very care of them after each use.  It also gets hot really easy, maybe after 10 minutes, and if you go over that, it almost burns your hand.  DON'T get it.",1
1,"WAY TO SMALL, THOUGHT  THEY WERE BIGGER",1
1,benefits do NOT justify the cost.  lots of hot air for no reward or improvement.  who knew products made these kinds of promises?,1
2,"I bought these and I was seriously disappointed. They didn't stay in very long and Heaven forbid if  you had to brush your hair after chalking it. It brushed right out! Hard Pastel Chalk sticks from the local Art store last much longer, are brighter, you can get more colours, and won't brush out. Plus you can buy 32 stick that are 3 times the size of these for $5 while this cost three times that. I would NEVER recommend these to anyone I know.",1
1,I do not own these brushes but just want to let any prospective buyers know that first of all these are fakes and MAC does not sell it's full sized brushes in sets like this. If you are looking for quality MAC like brushes go with Sigma brand or Sonia Kashuk from Target.,1
1,made very little difference and really hurt my ears,1
1.0,poor quality. hard to keep attached,1
1,"This hairspray built up a sticky substance around each hair.  My Hair Stylist washed it several times using his products to try to eliminate the build-up, but it took a month, using specified products to completely remove build-up, for my hair to look normal again.The first few weeks that I used Elnett, I thought that it was great, but gradually the build-up became overwhelming.  I had never had a hairspray that reacted in this manner.",1
1,These do not work at all. I purchased the special adhesive for foils and it still won't stick to my nail. It comes of unevenly and looks sloppy and unkempt on your nail. I would never purchase again.,1
1,"I bought this lotion because I have extremely sensitive skin that breaks out with most lotions I've tried, especially heavily scented ones. I've been using this for the better part of a year and the only reason it's been that long is because I hate wasting something. It's only been about 6 hours since I put it on and my skin is scaly it's so dry. I know it's \\""unscented\\"" but it smells horrible.",1
1,"I had purchased these through Amazon once in the past from this seller and was pleased, but the second time I did it was a completely different experience.  Two of the three brush heads in the package I received kept popping off the toothbrush - one never snapped on completely, and the other stayed on for only thirty seconds or so while brushing. I had to throw them both away.  The bristles of the third brush head wore out so quickly so that I had to throw that one away too after only about a month (and no, I didn't brush my teeth four times a day).  They appeared to be exactly the same as the ones I had ordered before, but it was a extremely inferior product compared to the one I previously purchased.  Don't waste your money.",1
2,this is okay not the best.,1
1,"Do NOT ever ever buy directly from Luminess Air! they are a scam company and will not tell you that once you give them your card, THEN they tell that each month you will be debited automatically for a new supply. But you can cancel....no you can't. We tried calls, letters, emails.....we have to cancel our card to stop the debits!!! They do NOT respond....go to any complaint site and see the numerous complaints on this company. If you must have this product, do so through Amazon.....or buy a similar product. NEVER use this horrible company!",1
1,Its not even an esuchen product. have no idea how they put esuchen as title! DO NOT BUY THIS KIND OF PACKAGE!,1
1,"Bought this shampoo to try out, as I'm a big fan of their shaping cream.  I have thick, straight hair.  That said, the stuff is horrible.  Left my hair extremely dry and hard to manage. Would not buy again not would I use it again if given for free.",1
2,"I only came back to this to look at others' reviews to figure out how to get this out of the bottle. I see people say heat it up..so I'm going to try that. As for other aspects, it arrived the day it said it would and smells like coconut and its a yummy coconut smell! So hopefully I can figure this thing out...because this stuff should last me like a year or something!!!",1
2,"Although I have not had ample time to see the results of using Scarguard yet, I would have to give it a rather low mark because it does not adhere to the scar area. My husband had extensive surgery which resulted in a scar running down the length of his torso (about 12 inches) and across half his stomach (about 8 inches) We have been applying it twice daily, but it does not stay on during the day, perhaps because of his shirts rubbing against it  all the time, and it does not stay on at night, perhaps because of moving around in his sleep. In any event, it might do well on places where the skin does not have any friction on it, but it is not doing a good job for him. He is now using a good quality vitamin E and massaging it into the area twice daily. This is supposed to soften up the scar tissue, which is his major concern.  We will not know whether that is effective for many weeks to come.",1
2,Smells really good but it's not perfume it's oil! Stained my clothes and left my skin really oily. I wouldn't recommend wearing it but it's good to put in a warmer for the house.,1
2,"I do like the colors of the beads but I am very disappointed with the scarce amount of them. Also when I tried to open them to use, there was so much static that the beads went flying out of the container. I had to throw them away and now have to wait for another shipment of different beads :(",1
2,"Reviewed coco-mango lotion & dislike the butter version for same reason - scent.  Too strong for me.  Not overpowering. Just that I am one who only likes very, very light, subtle scents on myself.  If you like the scent of the lotion, this butter would be great.  It makes skin feel so nice & soft, is thick but absorbs nicely.",1
1,"The title of this product says \\""Girls Night Out Dicky Beads\\"", and the tiny image shows a hippie looking girl wearing a necklace. I thought, based on what I could see from the title and the image that this product was bead necklaces suitable for a girls night out bachelorette party. It turns out this product is actually... beaded curtains. What the hell? How are beaded curtains part of a \\""girls night out\\""? Why doesn't the product description have the word \\""CURTAINS\\"" anywhere in it? Needless to say I was disappointed when these useless curtains arrived. If I could rate this negative one star, I would. But if you're looking for some curtains to decorate your bordello, this might be just the thing.",1
2,Poor quality. Keep looking and save your money.,1
1,"I was excited to get this product as I travel for work and thought it would be the solution to TSA regulations.  It is a well designed container and there is Amazing Grace solid fragrance inside but it is not NOT the Amazing Grace I've come to love.  This is not the first time I've been disappointed lately.  I don't know what they've done to change the formula but this is not even strong going on, never mind lasting for any length of time.  I kept it but will not reorder it again.",1
2,Broke very easily:(,1
1,Do not buy save your money and buy a nice pair of extensions these are a waste of money,1
2.0,Tmit took a month to get here they are small so you get what you paid for . so theyr are small i think am just going to buy other ones even tho if am going to waist more but they are going to be better,1
1,"This isn't what I ordered at all - the picture shows a ginger/red wig, and what came was a black wig with purple/red highlights. Extremely disappointed. Attempting to return, but told I must contact Customer Services. Beyond agitated with this.",1
2,Disappointing!  This product is more like a bb cream.  It does not conceal much of anything.,1
2,I used it twice a day and nothing happened,1
2,"This is doctor recommended for very dry, sensitive skin. It is a cream, not a lotion. As such, this goes on thick and does not absorb well at all. I felt like it went on over my skin rather than moisturizing in my skin. Would probably work best right out of the shower to lock in moisture but it just doesn't suit me. I was still left feeling like my skin was dry and tight.",1
1.0,cheap and cheesy not worth the money. Don't waste your time. Worth about 50 cents.,1
1,"I rarely find the negative in much of anything, but this product is simply awful. Sure, it's stylish, sure, every professional stylist I've ever been to has one of these sprayers, and sure, it puts out a super-fine mist...but I have no idea how it could last in a commercial setting. I used this sprayer all of 4 times and it broke - not for a hundred pumps each time, either. i probably squeezed the trigger 10 times total! I opened it up to see the inner workings and where it malfunctioned. The plastic piece that bears the most torque when you squeeze the trigger is only 2-3 millimeters thick!<br />You will regret our purchasing. Sorry, Cricket, you stink.",1
1,"I love CeraVe skin products, so I was excited when I saw this product at the drug store. Unfortunately, the sunscreen turned my face bright white.  I rubbed it in for a long time, but it would not fade. It would have been funny if I hadn't spent so much money on this product.<br /><br />I have pale skin to start with -- maybe it would work on someone with darker skin. But this product just looked horrible on me.",1
1,Didn't last 5 beard trims before running out of energy.  Replaced with brand new batteries and it would never start again.  Totally useless!  Don't be enticed by its low price - it isn't even worth the inexpensive cost.  Avoid this product!,1
1,"Don't bother with this dryer - on European voltage, it's super hot and burns your hair; on top of which it doesn't work in the UK, or at least it didn't for me; it wouldn't turn on at all.",1
2,Not as sharp as the original equipment.,1
2,"The mascara itself is \\""okay\\"" - I mean, it's waterproof yet comes off nicely with a mascara remover. It doesn't really do anything special for my lashes, but it's fine.<br /><br />My problem is the brush!  It's terrible! For starters, the brush is too flimsy!  When I try to put it on, I can't press it to my lashes to apply color because it bends away!!  It took FOREVER to get it on this way - it's like the brush was afraid to get into the lash and apply color.  And because I couldn't get it on fast enough, it dried and then it looked terrible as I tried to get enough on to even coat my lashes.  Then, why oh why is the top and bottom of the brush bigger than the middle??  That added to the difficulties I had. If I'd had a different brush in the right size, I may have tried that.  In the end, I threw it out and I'll keep searching for a good waterproof mascara. Total waste of money, and very frustrating.",1
1,These are counterfeit and not manufactured by clarisonic! The product ID and warranty are not compatible with clarisonic as well. These should have been removed from the website a long time ago!,1
1,Doesn't hold air.,1
2,I purchased this and the second time I used it the oil came out in clumps.  The oil separated from the shampoo.  I don't know if this is what was suppose to happen but I did not like it.  The oil ran down my arm the sink the tub  I was not pleased.  Lots of lather but very messy.,1
2,"My biggest problem with this is the smell.  They really should have left it unscented.  It smells like something Aunt Marge would put on her….  any way…  While it does aid in making my beard stay 'groomed', it's very sticky and I have to be careful not to have it leave oil marks my collar. I won't buy more.",1
2,I don't see the change and I'm not getting the results they said I would. I'm very disappointed to be honest,1
2,"I was super disappointed in this brush, and would return it if possible.  It's overall smaller than I thought it would be, and the bristles are not really soft. The overall brush is small, so when the bristles spread apart, they don't cover alot of area on your face. I suppose it could be a good brush to keep in your purse or office drawer for quick touch ups.  But don't buy this if you're looking for a good Kabuki or bronzer brush.",1
1,This is the size of a thumb👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼,1
1,I think the Suave dry shampoo worked better than this one. Not to mention the smell is horrid. Never repurchasing.,1
2,"I purchased this shampoo from a salon, after having run through all of the drugstore brands and having no success moisturizing my dry hair. I was sold on the list of healthful ingredients featured on the Perfect 10 bottle.<br />This shampoo did absolutely nothing for my processed hair. It did not lather at all -which I understand that lathering \\""friction\\"" can be considered bad for hair...but this shampoo did not leave my hair feeling the slightest bit clean.<br />It did not make my dry hair feel more moisturized.  And it did not smell good.  In fact, it had almost no fragrance at all (which maybe some people might like).<br />I spent almost $25 for this very small bottle of shampoo, and was extremely disappointed. I have since tried Biolage products and Catwalk products that faired better, for less money.",1
2,"I would'nt re purchase this, It did absolutely nothing for me.",1
1,This product stopped working after I used it 4 times.  The iron got too hot and overheated.  Before it overheated it did work well.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00022WA9K/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title,1

1,"I've been using this product faithfully for about 4 weeks, and so far, I can't see any difference.  I'll stick with it, but so far, I'm not impressed.",1
1,This cushion interferes with circulation and is not very comfortable.  The material is poorly constructed.  I have them once and threw them in the trash.,1
1,I ordered the piece along with a shaving brush.  the brush fit the stand but my razor did not. I can't put my razor on it.,1
1,"That's what you hear in rural New England. And I imagine, in many other places. Unfortunately, too many \\""middle manager\\"" types (or perhaps chemical engineers) have to justify their positions by changing products that already work. I can't know exactly what happened with Mitchum; it's just a reasonable guess.<br /><br />Thus the old formula that worked so well for me is no longer. The new does not work. Well, that's not strictly true. It works for a while but not for several days like it used to. I concur with other reviewers who are unhappy with this more recent formulation, and thank them for observing the chemical change and reporting which brands still work, Secret and Gillette Clinical Strength, both of which have Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly 20%, Mitchum's former ingredient. Wasted my dollars on this last purchase. 'Fraid I gotta jump ship. Goodbye, Mitchum, after many many years.",1
1,I bought it for my face because I sweat a lot.. It made my face tight after I let it dry for a couple seconds when I got to work I noticed that I wasn't sweating but once we went outside for water time in started to sweat like normal ....so it helped a little I guess ima keep using it to see if it takes time to start really working:/,1
1,did not find a difference between aloe vera and this.  I have many plants and use the fresh aloe instead,1
2,"These bands don't stretch like some I already have.  The first time I tried one on it slipped right off the back of my head.  Maybe they are made for children, but it doesn't say that.  I bought these because I didn't have a black headband.",1
1,This product ruined my hair pattern after three days of use by frizzing up my coils. The smell is also pretty pungent. My hair was soft though...,1
1,I ordered the white glitter and weeks later received a hot pink glitter with no receipt and no way of returning the item. Thanks for nothing.,1
1,Not my favorite product by far.  I will continue to use but will not re-buy.  My skin has awlays been dry but with this product leaves it extra dry and I am not happy with that.  Also the SPF in the lotion tends to burn when I put it on but that usually happens with all spf.,1
1,it wasn't what I expected.  didn't work.  it made me waste too much time doing my nails.  the nail polish just didn't dry.  it was a waste of time for me.,1
1.0,"This product is fabulous and the customer service couldn't have been better.  Placed the order and in two days there it was.<br />I read the reviews on Amazon and decided to try.  Hope to never run out.  It is the first moisturizer zi apply, let it absorb, and apply a serum and I am good to go.",1
1,"While it covers nicely and the colors are so very nice, since I started using it (changing colors every other day and layering it on, like I do it every other polish I own) I noticed my nails becoming very brittle and the top layer peeling off. NEVER before has this happened to me. I tried using a bottom coat of protective polish but it didn't help much. Whenever I bent my nail down (even just a small nudge) the top layer, starting from the ends, would separate and break off, or just chip off.<br />I didn't notice this happening until the second week, I simply used a bottom coat of nail hardener/strengthener and thought nothing of it. Then I started to notice how thin my nails were getting to the point of one slowly, painfully cracking in half. Yep I stopped using this on my finger nails. However it doesn't affect my toe nails at all. Weird.<br />So now I mostly use this polish for my art projects and such. Just hope this polish doesn't affect your nails the same way it did mine.",1
1,These are extremely cheap and when I recieved them the box was all bent up with the eyelashes everywhere (NOT HELD DOWN). Also some are broken!!!! I hate them!!!!! I wouldn't have paid one cent from them. I also tried to contact them and they never got back with me! Dont order these!!!!,1
2,"My first impression was negative. The box it was in was crushed and dirty with one end looking like it had been kicked around for several weeks. That was the good news! Inside a rather decent little case were the clippers and so on, made out of the thinnest, cheapest metal available that could get away with being called stainless steel. I have no doubt this will not last long.",1
2,"I liked the scent at first, but after awhile it (the scent) became irritating to me. It's weird, when I first bought it I was in love and wore it a lot. Then it started to smell very cheap. I have since gotten rid of it. I guess everyone is different in what they prefer.",1

1.0,Defective product,1
1,"I received this brush iron at the begining of January, 2013.  Today, February 12, 2013, it no longer is working.  What a disappointment!  This is not the first one I have bought of this brand.  The first one I bought lasted about 3 years or so, the next one I bought lasted about one and half years.  So it seems like the quality has steadily declined to where it lasts only a month.  On top of that, I am just 12 days past the return period on this ..... how convienent for them!  I have already located another brand that I will be buying now - won't be returning to Helen of Troy brand again.",1
2,Doesn't coat very even and when using gel you need to paint lightly.,1
2,Not as good as banana boat or other well known products.,1
2,The product worked great for about 5 months then the on/off switch went haywire and it quit working. I will never waste my money on another one.,1
1,"The roller ball top sounded good in theory, but it's not very practical in reality. The concealer is so thin! All it did was crease and slide around my under eye area, and yes I set it with powder. Awful. Will definitely not repurchase.",1
2,"Ehh, I'm not impressed with this product. The product isn't terrible and smells decent. I have short hair and I bought this product to mainly give texture and movement to my hair. It does an ok job, but nothing to rave home about. The container looked all beat up like it has been used when it arrived. For the price I paid, I would have expected a bit more...",1
2,"My legs are in terrible shape and I don't think any cream will cure my problem but this has been best at making them look and feel better. I'll buy this regularly. After my second purchase though, I'm concerned about pricing.  Frankly, I don't know how much this &#34;should&#34; cost but when I first bought this, it cost half the current price for 2 tubes.  When I bought recently, the price had doubled..... from 6something to 13 something.  I thought that I would still get 2 tubes but received only one.  Thirteen bucks for one tube seems way to high!!",1

1,"This is my first epilator and it has made me totally certain I will never try this method again. First impression is it's LOUD and scary. Not something I want near me. Looks like a torture device! I decided to give it a shot anyways and not only did it not work very well (lots of breaking hairs rather than plucking them) but it feels like a torture device. I have waxed before and it doesn't hurt nearly as much as this thing. Not even close. Especially on my legs I'm not that sensitive to hair pulling pain, I have waxed and tweezed before and it wasn't an issue, but this thing made my eyes water. Never again. If you want to get rid of hair, try waxing. Much less painful than this!",1
1,"Pre treatment gel smells like baby's vomit. I have used the real product before and it did not smell like vomit for sure. Also, the treatment gel was foaming slightly when i put on my skin, which never happened to me before with the real one. I am not sure if this is the real product or not... Or is it expired? There is no expiration date written anywhere.",1

There are 4 brushes and two caps, although the caps are useless as they don't fit on any of the brushes.<br /><br />I use the rectangular shaped head with my Gelish pHbond as the original brush is bent too and the triangle tipped one I use for applying glitter to the ends of my nails when I don't want to overuse product. Just drop a dab of glitter polish on and use it to spread it at the whites of my nails for a unique look.<br /><br />Update: 11/11/14: This ended up being tossed in the trash about a month or two after purchase. The original damaged bristles made it a waste of time to try to continue to use.",1

1,This shouldn't even be allowed to be called eyeliner! I've never come across a gel eyeliner in my life that wasn't at least a bit water proof. This eyeliner never even dries. I tried it once and it was terrible! I didn't even wash the brush after I used it and then ran it across my hand about 3 days later and it lined my hand just as if I had just dipped it in the liner. Crazy! I've never seen any eye makeup product like this,1

1,"Do NOT buy this comb if you have hair longer than four inches.  The handle broke (snapped in two) the first time I tried to use it.  The picture is deceptive, the handle is actually two parts.  The plastic comes from the teeth part and gets rather skinny & small to fit inside of the plastic end.  The plastic snapped 1 cm inside the handle.  You are better off buying a $2 regular comb from the drug store because the entire comb is one piece and the handle won't snap.<br /><br />Also - this product is advertised as &#34;Metallics Collection (Colors May Vary)&#34; - the one that arrived was not from the Metallics Collection at all (it was solid black, aka the original comb).",1

It has broken twice on me.. the first time it starting spitting out sparks so I sent it back.. they sent me a new one (of course I had to get a temporary one because it took a while to get it back) and now it only works on low, the high is broken..

Think about it Amazon, do you really want to offer customer service or do you want to make the customer work as hard as current-day phone customer service hell.  Because that is where you are headed, the site navigation and options simply to fix YOUR error are extremely sub-optimal.  I laughed at the language of one field that said \\""YOUR ISSUE\\"".  You should try the language, \\""Our Mistake\\"".  Let me guess, you have an ex-Microsoft employee scripting online feedback!  Their customer-focus DNA is non-existent -- go the other way! Also, you focus far too much on RETURNS.  This is not a return, you shorted me, I only received 5 of 6.  Understood, we are not talking big money, but I expect much much better execution than this; moreover, it appears someone opened the bag labelled \\""Sold as a set\\"".  Why? Theft? Another customer needed a single? -- you need to look into this.  Finally, the orientation of this section of product feedback implies so much of the problem is the product/vendor.  You need to offer equal chance to give feedback on your service.  If you want to try it, pretend you were shorted an item and seek resolution.  Finally, I have a photo -- no easy place to submit it in the feedback area.",1

1,"Hello all, I just arrived on post in Germany.  I'm an attractive guy, or so I'm told, and have a moderate personality.  Since being new, I've been traveling around a lot, especially to the bars in Cologne, Trier, and Frankfurt.  I bought this stuff out of curiousity to see if it had any added effect to my own natural charm.  It doesn't.  There were no approaches from women, increased reactions, squirming, or increased sexual arrousel as a result of wearing this stuff.  It's a gimmic, in my opinion.  Also, I've been checking out some of the other pheremone products offered on this site, and there seems to be 5 start reviews from the same folks.  This is highly suspicious to me.  Do yourself a favor and save your money.  I find being yourself, relaxed, and go out to have fun, and not with the intent to try to find anything is the greatest way to meet women.  It's always worked for me in the past.  Hope this helps.  Cheers",1

2,"Great toothbrush.  Poor longevity.  I like this toothbrush so much that I bought three of them. That's both the good news and the bad news.  The toothbrush works great. The best I have ever had. The first one lasted only one year. The second one lasted only seven months. Despite that, I like the toothbrush so much I just bought a third one. If this one doesn't last at least two years, I'll be finished with them.<br /><br />When the first toothbrush failed, I took it to my workbench and cut it apart to see what was going on. Interior electronics were completely corroded from water intrusion.  My conclusion is there is a manufacturing defect in sealing the electronics in the toothbrush handle. I plan to soon cut apart the second failed toothbrush to see if I find the same defect.  I love this toothbrush – but these things are not cheap – and if this third one doesn't last at least two years this will be my last purchase.  Hard to believe other consumers are not having this same problem.",1

1,"THEN: I used Avalon Organics Ultimate Moisture cream for over 10 years. It is the only product that really moisturized my skin here in the Rocky Mountains with nearly 350 days a year of unrelenting sunshine and wind at 8,000 feet above sea level. The original cream was a lovely and rich (without being heavy) cream that gave my skin a remarkable and noticeable glow often commented on by others. Fine lines were kept at bay, my face was never shiny or dry. Due to our extremely dry climate I would use approximately two 2 oz. containers a month. When I traveled to hot and tropical climates the amazing effect was an actual lessening of oiliness. I am at times prone to breakouts and this product never caused any. I would keep some in my purse to apply under my eyes once or twice during the day, and the effect was always a brightening lift of any appearance of fatigue, youth in a jar. No other cream (including several quite expensive ones) had ever been so remarkable. It was a quick to soak in, frothy souffle of intense moisture but with a feather light feel on the skin. I run out of adjectives trying to describe how perfect this cream was. I never broke out and my face felt and looked dewy and glowing.<br /><br />NOW: The name and formula have both changed. If you purchase from this page you will be receiving \\""Lavender Luminosity\\"" night cream instead. When I went to make a recent online purchase I saw more than one review of the product stating that if you had previously enjoyed this product to now beware. The new formula was an entirely different product and had suffered at the hand of the new \\""more sustainable\\"" formula. I note the company does not say what becomes \\""more sustainable\\"". I am inclined to believe it has more to to with their cash flow and less to do with the environment.<br /><br />I finally found a store I could test the new formula. I left without making a purchase because I found both the daily moisturizer and the night moisturizer, completely different products from their former selves. If this were an improvement I would have undoubtedly purchased in bulk. I am afraid I find both new products extremely, in a word, horrible. And it would be a gross waste of my money to purchase either one. I will also add he product turned my face dangerously red and stung like an angry hornet. A unique an unpleasant sensation no other product before or after has managed to produce.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to me my mother did purchase both the daily moisturizer and the Ultimate Moisture night cream (based on my rave reviews to her of the previous formula), which she gave me (since she didn't like it anyway). Braving a potentially hostile skin reaction, I wore the daily moisturizer for two days, and each day it felt like such a relief to wash my face. It leaves a completely unnatural \\""mask\\"" like layer on top of the skin without actually sinking in or moisturizing in any way. It feels like a layer of plastic saran wrap.<br /><br />I thought it not possible, but the night cream was even worse. It reminded me of some margarine I purchased during an extended stay in a third-world country once. I tried to melt it in a skillet and it never melted, even at very hot temperatures. It would never spread with any fluidity, nor would it soak in to any food item.<br /><br />I lament the new night cream feels just as cheap and ineffectually formulated as third-world margarine.<br /><br />I have never written to a company to express my disappointment until now. I wrote Avalon Organics to express to them my disillusionment with their new \\""improved\\"" product. They have chosen not to reply or acknowledge my letter.<br /><br />So, it is with a heavy heart that I find I must change my decade long and loyal romance with Avalon Organics to someone else. I am currently trying a bevy of products one after the other in my quest. None are as perfect as the one solitary jar I have left of the original formula \\""Ultimate Moisture Cream\\"". Good title that one, \\""ultimate\\"" is absolutely right.<br /><br />If you are a user of the late lamented Ultimate Night cream and have found any product that compares favorably please let me know.mate\\"" is absolutely right.<br /><br />If you are a user of the late lamented Ultimate Night cream and have found any product that compares favorably please let me know.",1
2,"I am an avid cuticle clipper.  I owned a slanted clipper like this for 5 straight years and it was sharp the entire time (and only cost me $1.29).  Along my journey to find that perfect one again I have purchased probably 15 different ones (maybe some were the same, who knows - this includes the scissor looking cuticle clippers which have never worked for me)  and this is one of the few I could actually clip some cuticles with, so there's that - but that was also short lived.  This is usable as a regular clipper and because it will actually clip nails (I've definitely owned clippers that are more likely to tear your nail than clip it) I gave it the extra star.  Obviously it cuts in more of a straight line than a curve so you have to be careful to shape your nails.<br />If you want a cuticle clipper, get the $11 italian one,  it's the only one that is sharp and precise like my old one is.

1,Sent it back,1
2,I dont see what was so potent about this product.....I used it for a month. I should have known because some of the pictures on the bottles look so fake~,1
2,"Another reviewer pointed out that this is pretty much impossible to fold back up the way it came. And how right they were! Plus, it's a bit on the short side for tall people; I'm 5'10\\"" and my husband is 6'2\\"" and we both need to bend down when we're in it.<br /><br />It does a great job of preventing over-spray in the house. And we now just crumple it up and stuff it in a closet when it's not being used. I'd do a bit more research and get a tent that's easier to put away.",1
1,I have a 1060x my wife bought it for Xmas.Worst shaver ever . Not a close shave takes forever to get close.I don't have a heavy beard.No adjustments terrible trimmer.My Wife paid over $150 for this crap. I loved my Norelco rechargable 4950 had that almost 25 yrs.With this new on blades are close to $85.My AA battery Braun pocket shaver for $20 blows it away hand down.,1
2,While I support breast cancer awareness I am not a big fan of the glass nail file. Love you all who give support to those in need!,1
1,I have been using this product now for about two months. It did not help improve the look or texture of my acne scar like it said it would. It was a total waste of my money. I would not recommend this product.,1
2,Lets just say I gave it away... I felt like I had nothing from Clinique on. But it got to me quick...,1
1,I'm amazed this product had so many good reviews.  There is a set of plastic corners or edges that are on the ends of the heating plates. These catch and pull my hair breaking or pulling out my hair.  The unit is also bulky and heavy. Amazon has been great though and handled the matter.,1
2,"I'm glad that it helps some people, but my rash is as bad as when I started using Nixoderm. people also are offended by the smell. the case is extremely hard to open, as well.",1
2,"After scouring amazon for a shower mirror, I decided on this one--currently the highest rated shower mirror I could find.  With shipping and tax (via Target; amazon didn't have it) this was like $26, and I have to say it's not even close to worth it.    First off this mirror has *no* fog-free characteristics whatsoever unless you fill it with water.  Unless you're carefully filling it from a faucet or tub spout beforehand, you're likely planning to use the shower head to fill it.  My shower head covers the whole front of the mirror with water droplets while filling the reservoir (as I imagine anyone's would) so no matter what I'm shaving through those and/or having to wipe the whole thing down before use.  I think the reservoir \\""funnel\\"" has to be a LOT bigger and/or a different shape to not have to soak the entire front of the thing while filling it.  I could take any mirror and hose it off in the shower and it would be \\""fog free\\"" for a couple of minutes.    Also some have said the fog free effect lasts a long time once you fill it--a claim I vehemently disagree with.  The box says the mirror should not drain totally until 20 minutes have passed--mine takes about 3 minutes to drain totally after filling and then it's covered with fog.  It drains so fast I'm tempted to fill the hole used to drain closed and then just dump the water in the reservoir out when I'm done.  The drain cuts the time on this WAY too short.    Some have had problems with the suction mechanism--mine seems to stay attached to the wall well.  Have they changed the cups since those reviews were written?  Perhaps this depends a lot on your shower wall surface--ours is smooth but it stays put for at least many weeks at a time--I'll take it off and clean behind it every few weeks. It seems to me like the design of the suction and the removable mirror was done pretty well...which puts me in complete opposite opinion of most of the reviews here.  I'd say \\""bad mirror, decent mount\\"" while most are sayingthe opposite.    I'd love to recommend a product I've found that works better here but I don't have one.  It seems the shower mirror thing is still a work in progress.  Hopefully someday someone will invent a mirror that works effectively on its own and stays fog free without having to fill a reservoir.  Having to fill this and wipe this adds a lot of fiddling around that it seems like could be eliminated by a better product or better design.",1
1,"This is the worst facial hair bleach cream out there. It burned my skin like crazy that I had to call the emergency and poison control center. The marks lasted well over several months. I reported the incident to Sally Hansen, but they never bothered to write back even though I provided all the lot and manufacturing info. DO NOT BUY SALLY HANSEN!",1
2,I'm not really sure what this hair water actually does. It does not seem to make my hair smooth or shiny. It might slightly detangle and it smells good. That is it. I was disappointed as I love the shampoo and conditioner in this line.,1
1,"My face reacted horribly to this product. It began to burn horribly and itch within the hour after applying the product to my face.<br /><br />Unfortunately I did not research and read reviews elsewhere, which most people were having a bad reaction. Especially if they even slightly began to sweat...such as when on a walk or even cooking dinner.<br /><br />From further research I found that the bismuth oxychloride is the cause and am now seeking a mineral makeup that does not contain this ingredient.<br /><br />Also, the brushes that come with this kit will fall apart and leave tons of brush hairs on your face, which are a pain in the rear to remove.<br /><br />This was a waste of money!",1
1,"I only use this on my upper lip, while taking breaks in between tears,not my under arm because it hurts far too much! I would not recommend this to anyone",1
2.0,It doesn't work and has very strong fumes when you spray it on.,1
1,I followed the instructions to mold the trays to my teeth and when I attempted to take the tray out of my mouth half of it ripped apart.  Now I'm $30 out for an absolutely piece of garbage.,1
1,Do not buy this pencil. I was very disappointed.  It was defective during the first use.,1
1,Not a good product for me. I took the first pill and had a allergies all over my face neck and shoulders.,1
1,"I purchase my Quickbreeze oral irrigator over a month ago and it is virtually impossible to install.  I migh as well have flushed the $29.95 down the toilet.  I am very deligent about oral irrigation as part of my dental hygiene, that i had to purchase a new waterpik even though I have this quickbreeze irrigator.  Don't waste your time or money.",1
1,This made my eyes itch.,1
2,"I don't know what I expected....maybe something a little better since it has the Conair name on it.  The rollers get plenty hot, but the clips are a pain to use and don't hold.  They also leave crimping in the hair.  Wish I had purchased the jumbo rollers with the regular metal clips that hold better.  Now I'm stuck with something I probably won't use much.",1
2,It is not sharp enough to shave easily. 75% satisfying.,1
1,This is terrible and only makes u darker,1
2,"The product is great but the bottle was at least a third gone and the box smelled like perfume when you opened by back door where the UPS man left the box. The squirter shoots out a large amount as opposed to a mist. Love the smell, but probably wont' reorder from this seller.",1
1,Got as gift and had to promptly return them.  You need ear plugs for these clippers and it plucks your hair instead of cutting it.  We have a more expensive pair of Wahl clippers and they work fine but the blades are dull.,1
2.0,It doesn't shave well. don't recommend it,1
2,"***Update 10/12/2016 - I had to update this because it seems after using this for about two and a half years it looks like the motor (or possibly the battery?) is starting to give out on me.  I may not be the best at oiling the groomer, but I keep it clean and dry when not in use and am mildly disappointed in this performance.<br />The trimmer works like a charm, and the adjustible guard is very helpful.  The base is nice and makes it look sophisticated on your counter.  I've not tried to use this in the shower to test the &#34;wet&#34; performance, but otherwise works well.",1
1,"I thought this is one of the good nivea products.. however, this is not the best deodorant to use.. it doesn't work , no whitening and on the other hand, it make my underarm smelly.. eew",1
2,"This provides a good value for the money.  Nice zippered compact, round face brush that fits nicely in the front part of the compact BUT you need to fill the powder compartment yourself which is a little messy.  You don't manage to actually get much product in the container and then it was hard to get out and apply.  This product has a lot of design flaws but I trust this company to come up with something better in the future. The actually item is nice for something else--mini-wallet?? However, if you're looking for a traveling BE compact-- right now--pass.",1
1,I did not like this makeup at all. It had very little coverage so I sent it back.,1
1,horrible.  So sheer and gritty.  would not recommend this particular color.Looked cheap on.  Not the normally rich looking Nars colors I am used to,1
1,"Reading the title &#34;SonicDermabrasion&#34; lead me to believe that this was a sonic action product.<br /><br />It was not.<br /><br />The prodct has a rotating head.  It just rotates.

1,"These are only really useful if you use them with the [[ASIN:B000ZWR1DW TheraFlu Flowing Vapors Vapor Fan]] they fill.  They aren't medicated, they don't have all that powerful a smell, and they just aren't much use unless you're just looking for the smell of eucalyptus.  At least they come with a replacement holder to go in the fan incase you somehow broke the original.  I got no benefit at all from these.",1
2,I used Chocolate Cherry back when it went by that name and loved it. This #36 is way too red. I mean carrot red. I had bought three because I hadn't found it locally but now I see that Loreal changed this to having way too much red in it. My hair was orange! Would not recommend it to anyone who wants dark brown with red highlights. This will give you red hair. YUK!,1
1,"Do not recommend, it simply won't cure Gelish nor Shellac.<br />Even after the top coat when I got to the \\""cleansing\\"" step everything came off on the wipe.<br />Waste of money, wish I had returned it, but kept for a long time \\""trying it out\\"".<br />Learn from my mistake and move on directly to the LED.<br />I bought a 36W that didn't work either!",1
1,a waist of money,1
2,"These were not very good at all.  They maybe ok if they were for fake nails,  but for real nail with product on nails too & trimming your nail,  these are not the right clippers.",1
2,My daughter got this and said that it was a bad lip balm and that it did not last long at all (she threw it out after the third day because she said it started to smell bad),1
1,worst purchase ever,1
1,"I'm sitting here with a red, blotchy rash on my face that's very uncomfortable. I've also got huge, puffy bags under my eyes. All of this happened within a couple of days of me starting to use Boots No. 7 Protect & Perfect beauty serum. Apparently, I'm allergic to something in this product. My face is bumpy and discolored, and it hurts. The package says the product is hypoallergenic, but be aware that it can cause an allergic reaction. Believe me, this product has done nothing to increase my beauty - in fact, I'm embarrassed to leave the house. This was my first Boots purchase, and it will definitely be the last.",1
1.0,"I never thought I had particularly sensitive skin but this stuff have me small mini gives all over my chin. In my opinion, nothing that goes on your skin, ESPECIALLY your face, needs to be perfumed. I definitely prefer and recommend unscented and mostly natural products because of my skin's reaction to this bb cream. It also made my skin look greasy and not dewy. All in all I would not recommend this product.",1

1,"The set was delivered with missing parts, specifically the Professional Lancet & Extraction. Not cool... Other than that, the set was fine. Not super high quality, but functional.",1
2,It just did not work for me. I think buying this product was one of my worst decisions. TRY SOMETHING ELSE.,1
2,"I think \\""plush\\"" should be removed form the description.<br /><br />The outside was thinner and less 'fluffy' then I expected. The inside was not fluffy/padded at all. Think light mesh; almost plasticy. \\""Spa Robe\\""? Maybe a ghetto spa. I regret not buying a higher quality.",1
1,I have a hair net one can hardly see on the hair bun but this one surprise me look like big awkward stuff on hair.,1
2,I wore them everyday.<br />I will not buy any more from Dream Products.<br />I woul not recommend these shoes for anyone.<br />They didn't live up to their advertisement.,1
1,I have not purchased this product through Amazon a friend gave me some to try and I was unimpressed. She is having a horror story getting out of them shipping this product and charging her bank account. This is pure thievery.,1
2,All of the scrunchies I ordered from this place were a disappointment. Overpriced and not made well. Would not recommend.,1
2,"Meh, didn't love it. The Umbra brand from Target is better.",1
1,Not only did this not make my hair look any cleaner... it smells awful!  The strong fragrance made me have a sore throat all day.,1
2,"I usually shave in the shower with my Gillette Fusion but wanted a back-up electric for a quick trim. I found the Emjoi on an Ebay daily deal for $19.99 with free shipping and got it. First of all this is NOT worth the retail of $150 as, unlike other shavers, it does not collect the whiskers internally. They just drop to the sink, floor or on your shirt. The rotating blades do offer a smooth shave but, to avoid an unpleasant razor burn, you should first use a skin treatment like Williams 'Lectric Shave to lessen the friction. In all, it does the job in a pinch, is not the most comfortable and is certainly no $150 razor. (The nose hair trimmer that came as an added bonus is powered by one AAA battery and is effective.) So, if you want an electric shaver for the same reasons and can get it for under $30, go for it. For everyday use at a higher price, there are much better options.",1
1,Did not receive. Got duplicate of a different one.,1
2,This item was a disappointment.  The colors I received were hideous.  The towels themselves were not absorbent at all.  These will be used as garage rags.  Don't waste your money.,1
1,"Simply put - fails to work right out of the box.  So i open it, put batteries in it, amd spend a half hour trying to figure out what i'm doing wrong.  Finally conclude it is defective.  I really wanted a battery powered shaver as opposed to rechargeable and this is really the only one i can find.  So i order another one on amazon, there's a silver one i figure what are the chances i get a second defective one?  Well, it was.<br /><br />Waste of money and time don't buy this product.",1
1.0,"I was very disappointed it when I got it and read the ingredient list.  It may be sulfate free but has a lot of other chemicals some of which when I looked them up state they can dry out your hair and cause frizz - that's what I'm trying to fix, my dry and frizzy hair.",1
1,"I used to LOVE this gradual tanner. The last time had used it was a year ago, so I decided to buy another bottle. The bottle looked differently, and I just figured the packaging changed. However, about an hour after using it I started getting a massive headache and my skin burned a little. Now I HATE it. So, I'm thinking they've reformulated it since last year, but I could be wrong. One thing that I do know is that I'm allergic to it now, so just a warning; if you've got sensitive skin you might want to try another sunless tanner. I'm now using Jergen's and it works great without any allergy problems. The Jergen's also doesn't smell as strongly.",1
1,"Just received the soap from the UK.  It's not the Oilatum we knew and loved.  Thus far, I know that contains perfum suitable for a cheap whore.  It wreaks.  The new manufacturers are too stupid to realize that people with particular needs and possibly problems bought the old Oilatum.  It was never inexpensive.  Do they not wonder why someone would pay such money for a bar of soap?  The last thing Oilatum fans probably wanted was a change in the formula and a perfume added.  I can't bear the scent of it, so I may never use it.",1
1,"Patterns on the package are totally different from the picture, and the smell is different from my previous genuine one.",1
2,I can't get over the smell.  Sorry.  I've tried for several weeks.,1
1,I ordered these expecting assorted colors. I start chemo in a few days. i got 12 black and 12 white turbans of poor quality. What did I expect for five dollars? Don't bother with ordering these unless you want 12 caps to sleep in. They aren't good for anything else but for sleeping or being at home. They are cotton knit. They wash reasonably well. Fortunately my doctors office had some nice large scarves there.,1
1,"The blade is poorly designed and the stainless steel is poor quality.  The plastic handle is OK, but this implement is not worth the price.",1
2,I'm very disappointed in this product.  I purchased the toothbrush May 2013 and it no longer holds a charge.,1
1.0,"The description and even the packaging say clip ins but mine did not come with clips, just a long weft. Granted, it's only 80g but the ends are way too thin. I've bought the same amount and better quality for way less. Definitely not worth what I paid for. Only reason I'm not returning is because I have clips to use.",1
1,This product could be perfect. It is shaped in a way that reaches inside the nose to cleanly clip the hairs. Worked great until one time - approximately after a month's use - it stopped working. New batteries did not help. I bought another one assuming the experience with #1 was a fluke. The second one lasted a week. It died - nothing I tried would make it run.     Too bad - seemed like a great design ... if you could get it to run.,1
2,I have long thin hair and expected to see some type a shine after weeks of using it but no. It didn't make my hair shine any more than any other shampoo. Nothing special here.,1
1,Doesn't work waste of time and money better off going to dr fisher shrink like 1 inch the product is overrated,1
1,It's awful...not the Color at all as it should be Plus not being able to Return SUXS!!!!!,1
1,"This is a very strange, overpowering scent that made me nauseated. I'm sending it back.",1
1,"It works fairly well, but suddenly stops working in a short time.  I purchsed this item several months ago and, after one month (used it twice), it just stopped working!  I ordered another one, thinking MAYBE it was just bad luck.  The new one lasted 3 months (about 5 uses), then just stopped working.  I tried new batteries and kept re-checking but still can't get it to work.  I just ordered a different brand yesterday.",1
1,By now we should all be aware that most haircare products that promise hair regrowth are not really proven to do so. Save yourself the money and cut your hair shorter.,1

1,"I ordered Alferd Dunhill Desire and expected to get the original one as shown in the image.

1.0,Not what I wanted. Thought the comb was bigger.,1
2,when I first bought it I used it 2 or 3 times and the spinner would not work any longer. I sent it back and they sent me a new one and I'm hoping this one last me for a lot longer since I was careful when I use them.,1
1.0,"This was my first foray into beard balm. It came in a little burlap bag. The initial impression by my graphic designer wife was how terrible the label/logo are. Whatever, it's what's inside that counts, right? Well, the lid to the mustache was was so tight I ended up leaving it barely attached so I wouldn't have to fight with it. For the balm, the &#34;wet sand&#34; meets tapioca pudding consistency was interesting if not weird. It makes a creamy oil when warmed up in your hands and leaves your beard pretty oily throughout the day and builds up even more so during a week of use unless you shampoo your beard daily. I didn't enjoy the scent or product very much but I thought maybe the earthiness scent would translate to manliness. It was when my 8 daughter would turn her nose up at kisses saying my beard smelled like vomit that I realized this product had to go. The mustache wax that was a pain to apply had to go as well. I switched over to Beard Brand for beard oil and mustache wax and realized caring for your facial can be downright pleasurable for you and your loved ones. Their scents are great, the oil is light and easy to apply, and the mustache wax is light and soft and comes in an applicator similar to chapstick that can run across the `stache and eyebrows easily. I gave Honest Amish an honest month of use and honestly can say I this product was objectionable for me and my family.",1
1,The smell of this one is too strong and very manly. It will stay with you the next day too.,1

2,"I did a lot of research before buying this product, and when I got it I figured I'd have to go over my legs a few times before I got all of the hair removed. But I didn't realize exactly how many times I'd have to go over the area that I wanted removed. I've had to go over areas around 5 or 6 times to get all of the hair off, and even then small hairs show up here or there. Perhaps this is because I have thin hair, but it still has not helped me all that much. I gave it two stars just because it may be my hair's fault for the problem.",1
2,"I'm still trying to think of what this smells like, it's not even close to coffee.

(my mistake.)<br /><br />I followed the instructions.  It took all day.  This product comes with two packets: henna and dark brown.  For dark brown hair they recommend that you dye your hair twice: first with the henna packet and second with the dark brown packet.  I let the henna dye stay on my hair for three hours, rinsed it and dried it, then put on the dark brown dye for four hours.  Per the instructions I used coffee in the mix to deepen the color.<br /><br />IT DID NOT WORK.  My hair is now an ORANGE-brown.  It does not look natural at all.  It looks NOTHING like the hair color of the woman on the package.<br /><br />The instructions say &#34;First time henna users: Please note your results may vary with the first application, you may have to wait for the 2nd application to get the desired darker color.&#34;  I am not going to do that.  I'm afraid that a 2nd application would make it even more orange!<br /><br />Star rating:<br />I don't like the fact that my hair ended up the wrong color.<br /><br />Henna is PERMANENT and almost impossible to remove.  You'll need to use a color remover or hair bleach if you want to remove the color.  Those products tend to damage hair.  Too risky for me, so I guess I'll live with ORANGE-brown hair for a while.

1,I have to give this one star. I am a makeup artist and was looking for a pallets with a variety of colors but not as expensive as other brand name products. Lets just say you get what you pay for. I used my UDK primer underneath and the color payoff was terrible. I even used my MAC paint pot before applyinbthe shadow and same thing. Even after building the eyeshadow I just wasn't happy. This pallet is for someone who doesn't have high expectations with their product. Maybe a teen would love this. But for my line of business it doesn't help.,1

It takes days for you to even have a bowel movement and when you do not much comes out. It does not give you cramps or makes you run to the toilet, but it is too light to even be a cleanser. The pills are huge, make sure you chug a big glass of water. I still feel like crap. I followed the directions. Sometimes made me feel like I had to go but I couldn't. When I did go it was hard to come out. I don't know. Save your money cause this crap is a waste and good for nothing.",1

1,I know for $7.95 what can you expect. The noise this machine makes is louder that my weed eater and it's electrical. I turned it on heard the noise and it went right into the dumpster. My wife just looked at me and said :I told you so&#34;. Is okay.,1
2,I had previously purchased the light and medium version of this product. My daughter wanted to try the darkest. I was very disappointed.

It also lost the \\""smooth\\"" and \\""tingly\\"" effect I loved at first. I started doing research on my makeup to determine if my makeup was the cause. I came across a list of pore-clogging ingredients to avoid in makeup (translate: all facial skin care) and guess what it included? Red algae, kelp, spirulina, coconut oil -- four of the major ingredients in this facial cleanser! I am almost positive that this cleanser may now be a cause of the breakouts since they're all over my face now. THIS IS MARKETED AS A PRODUCT FOR ACNE BUT ACTUALLY CONTAINS PORE CLOGGING INGREDIENTS. Watch out. Also, nowhere on the bottle does it state \\""non-comedogenic\\""... I am now noticing. So, sorry about the earlier review... it was true at the time! I changed the stars down to 2 stars, because I do appreciate the vegan and organic nature of the product, however, it is mis-marketed and mis-leading. The search for a cleanser continues, but now I'm armed with a list. Anyone interested could probably easily google one. It's just a bit of work to go through the list with every product in question. But I'm now thinking it's worth the work!<br />****<br /><br />I've been using this twice a day as a cleanser - morning and night - for about three weeks now. I've used it as a mask a handful of times.<br /><br />I have combination skin and stubborn mild-to-moderate acne (blackheads and whiteheads) that is difficult to clear up. Previously I'd been using benzoyl peroxide, but it's so harsh on skin -- it sort of helped keep some acne away, but it also caused new acne of a different type due to over-dry skin. I wanted to try something more natural. I splurged on this product because I'd heard that Japanese skin care products (which this is?) are fantastic for skin.<br /><br />My skin feels SO smooth after using this, and refreshed. Some people have commented about the smell, but I think it smells great! It's a little bit minty - it smells sort of fresh. I really can't think of another daily cleanser I've used that I prefer.<br /><br />I also enjoy it as a mask. It dries quickly! It \\""tingles\\"" the most when used as a mask, and leaves skin very smooth.<br /><br />It's NOT perfect. For some reason, my forehead is continuing to break out (more so than usual!) while the rest of my face is completely clearing up and evening out its tone and smoothing out. I don't understand this at all. My forehead is not \\""unique\\"" -- my nose and chin get just as oily usually as my forehead does, so it doesn't really make sense to me. However, the type of breakout that is occurring on my forehead is much smaller acne and it's mostly blackheads which aren't visible from far away -- they're only bumpy when you're looking closeup in the mirror. And more non-visible blackheads are preferable to me than fewer painful red raised lumps, which is what I was getting before.<br /><br />I do get a couple of occasional blemishes still -- but they clear up MUCH more quickly on their own than they used to. And again, they are smaller than they used to be. I feel as though my skin is healing, although I'm not sure what is going on with my forehead. I'm going to give it some more time and see. I am using this in conjunction with another in their line of products -- the purity spot treatment. Trying both out at once.<br /><br />This works MUCH better when you are able to avoid popping anything. If you are able to be patient, small blemishes go away on their own in a day or two.<br /><br />It's a cleanser and it also will remove makeup, so you wouldn't need to separately remove light to moderate makeup first -- you can just use this to cleanse. I usually use a little bit more to remove makeup and just foam it up in my hands first (it foams really well). In the mornings I don't need as much.",1
2,No aroma and doesn't diminish my restless legs syndrome.  Used for one week . . . . a waste of money.,1
2,never came close to doing what it was supposed to do: provide a matte finish on your face. would not recommend,1
2,This cream made no difference in the appearance of my skin. I will continue to use my old cream because it's less expensive and seems to moisturize better,1
1.0,Actually made my outbreak worse.,1
1,"I love Alphaparf but this particular product is horrible. My hair is so course and tangled after using. I don't know how to return, so I'm stuck with it.",1
1,Broke as soon as got it...,1
2,Worked great on my fine hair...until it started making a metal clicking sound and overheated after less than 30 seconds. Cooled off and tried again next day and died again. Not very sturdy. Will try another brand.,1
2,I did not see any difference from before and after used of this product,1
1,"I have pretty dry, bleached hair and this was of no help.  It felt as though the shampoo did not all come out even though it was and it made my hair really heavy and oily.  Will not buy again.",1
2,The product is great but the containers are different from what you normally get and there is less in them.  The container says .35oz but both jars lasted less than half the time of the .3oz jars I get from the hairdressers.,1
2.0,I wanted the liquid spray.  The formula is to thick for my hair. The liquid spay is excellence.,1
2,"These are too small for my eyes. I thought they would be a little longer,they also get stuck together when peeling off of the paper. Happy I didn't spend much on these.",1
2,I have tried many make-up removal cloths but I didn't particularly like this because it made my eye sting after using it and it wasn't as large as the previous ones I have tried.  It did get the make-up off my face but I think that the manufacturer should remove whatever the chemical that causes the stinging of the eyes and make the size much larger to cover the facial area more.,1
2,"The balls on these roller bottles are somewhat loose and the whole thing is cheaply made. When I try to apply my essential oils mix to mine or my kids or boyfriend's bodies, a lot comes out!! And that shouldn't happen. You can hear a slight grinding noise when you close the cap as well. Won't buy again. Sorry :(",1
1,ridiculous price for just a fan and black light  I could have used a small fan from home and put a black light bulb in a small lamp for a few dollars instead of $125  plus the bulb went out after 2 uses  I want to return it sooo bad!!,1
1,"This product is an old version from Nuskin, but it's presented using with new version picture(face conductor is different).  This seller has the worst attitude I have ever seen from my online shopping experiences.  Amazon.com should have removed this seller from the market place!",1
2,Not good wiil call because the sprayer does not work properly  fragrance y good but does not sprays properly thankyou,1
1,I purchased the wrong thing.  I need the one for sensitive skin.  This version is a bit too rough for my skin.,1
1,"Horrible quality all around! Looks nice in the photo, but it is extremely hard to apply and the glitter might as well be a glitter pen from a childs school box. Very sticky and looks like a 10 year olds dress up play makeup. Dont waste your money! Nothing good at all to say about this product.",1
2,"I love this product and it is becoming difficult to find without the SPF in it which irritates my skin. So I'm pleased to be able to find it here. However, the description on this product says \\""pack of 2\\"", but only one bottle is delivered. I hope that they change the description to accurately portray what you will get.",1
1,Uncomfortable on the hands,1
2,"This product may work as advertised, but it came with abbreviated and unintelligible instructions. I tried using it a few times and succeeded only in burning myself. But, it was cheap - and if you know how to use it, it's probably a pretty good deal!",1
2,"The picture of this Peignoir Nail Dress is very deceiving. In the picture, it looks like there are colorful jewels on a white background. I just bought these and applied them and there is not any white in the nail strips. The jewels are on a clear background sticker. The only way to get it to look like this picture is to apply a white nail polish first, then apply the nail strips.",1
2,Did not make a much difference on my hair.,1
2,"I was specifically looking for this version of the Oral-B brush. After receiving the product in a plain brown box I grew concerned it was a nock-off. So, I went to Best Buy and purchased the same version and did a comparison. The components from the Amazon product was of lesser value.",1
2,Ordered before Christmas and nothing yet it's almost MLK bday.,1
1,Makes my skin break out. It seems like it would work very well because the scrubbing beads are micro but really it breaks you out.,1
2,Comes with no glue and are not that long. My eyelashes are short & these just come above my eyelashes. Would've liked something more intense!!,1
1,"First off, there were no directions (do I apply before or after my mascara application?). All in Japanese. Based on the reviews, I applied after. There was barely any product on the mascara brush. The tube seemed empty. Either that or the item is over-packaged.",1
2,awkward,1
1,"It doesn't lather, like at all. Don't purchase.",1
1.0,"1) This product is not approved for sale in Canada. Theradome sent me a helmet, and the first one slipped through customs. It was not working out of the box, and when they tried to send another, Health Canada blocked it as an unapproved product and is destroying it. That means 2) they cannot really fulfill their warranty in Canada, certainly not to replace it. Which leads to 3) it's taken me 2 full months since receiving it, and its still not working like it should out of the box. The charger they sent was broken, which ruined the first battery. I had to install a new one myself. Theradome will not provide any support and offered nothing in return for not being able to fulfill their warranty for the year, not a partial refund, nothing. The customer service reps are polite, but unable to do much to help. None could give me an answer about the product's status in Canada, despite my asking in several emails. One rep referred me to the CEO, who ultimately failed to provide any info or resolution and told me to call the 1-800 line. If the 1-800 number had worked in the first place, they would have resolve it without the need to speak to the CEO. One would think a CEO would be savvy enough to get that. If this thing breaks again, I am completely on my own whether its in the next year or not. If you are in Canada - do not buy this product. You will be disappointed.",1
2,"I bought this as a pack of three, but they only had 2 in stock, instead of waiting for a third of the kind i wanted did they send a replacement.... Nooo they sent nothing, so did they reduce the price by a thrid.... ohhh Nooo they didnt do that either, did they at least not charge full shipping...Ahhh ermmm nope,<br />So i basicaly got two out of three lipsticks for the full price of three.",1
2,"It's hard to apply because you have to rub and rub it to get a good, dark line. My eyelids hurt after that! It looks perfectly nice once you can get a good coat on, and it lasts all day. I love the little sharpener, and it does apply better after you use the sharpener. But you'd have to use the sharpener every day, losing a lot of the product that way. Also, with all that applying, the pencil twists back down. So I'm constantly twisting it back up and trying to figure out how to keep it from twisting back in while I'm using it. I wont buy again.",1
2,"I didn't notice any effects from taking this stuff, which isn't very comforting for the price of just under $30.",1
1,"I used to love this product a couple of years ago when it actually contained vitamin E. It no longer does say that on the bottle therefore it is a product under false advertisement! I've been better off without it. I left several messages with Herstyler, and to date no response.",1
1,Very expensive and deceiving because you only get one tube when the picture shows two. They charge you enough for two too!,1
1.0,Does not work at all don't buy it!!,1
1,The nails look very cheap when you put them on its very to get them to stay on they pop off no matter how many times you buff and prep the nails a waste of money I contacted the seller they were no help at all........,1
2,"So let me tell you a little about myself. I am the founder of whatever.com. This is a website that basically sits on the internet and collects views, and does nothing else. A few months back some rich old geezer chanced upon my website. He saw the front page had a view count of over 700 million. So it dawned on his old feeble mind that he should invest all his money in my website. He called me up (he didn't know how to use email) and asked about my website, whatever.com. He asked me what its purpose was, I told him I'll be damn if I know. He told me he would call me back about an offer to invest in the website. And surely he did. Then some other rich old geezer called about investing in my website. Then another. Then another. Then....well you get the idea. Old people must have some secret language they all communicate in that we can't understand, may be it has to do with that shaking they all do. Anyway, I don't care, I'm rich now! The only problem is that these old geezers keep coming to my office to talk to me about their investments. Even after they leave, my office still has that old people smell...young people know what I mean. This is where Clive Christian comes in.<br /><br />I thought I could cover up that smell with cologne. I figure the more expensive, the better it would work. And what cologne is more expensive then Clive Christian's Imperial Majesty? So I bought 300 bottles, just because I can. And guess what? IT DOESN'T WORK! $435,000 per bottle and it can't even get that old people smell out! As a matter of fact, Clive Christian Imperial Majesty smells like urine. So now my office smells like old people and urine. The life of an dot.com billionaire.",1
1,"I was excited about the color of these extensions, but when I received them, they were so thin that you would need at least 3 packages to get anywhere near the fullness of real hair.  I even have thinner hair and couldn't make 2 packages work.  There were also pieces of thread throughout the extensions making them look very cheap. I do not recommend these extensions and am sending them back immediately.",1
2,Had to replace it and even that one was broken..,1
1,"First of all, I was excited to try the hairspray as I live in a very his climate. The first time I tried it I put the usual amount on my hair, and my hair was super crunchy! Next time, I put way less and still had the same problem. Now, I'm not even using it. Beware! Not a fan!",1
1,"The bleach was extremely thick...like the texture of honey! We had to add water to it to even use it. But it DID bleach my hair. The dye, however, didn't take..at all!",1
2,"I use the fitted bottom Invacare sheet to keep the foam topper aligned with the hospital mattress. I use a regular sheet over the Invacare bottom sheet. I use the Invacare pillowcase as a liner. Use a regular cotton pillowcase over it. If I had it to do over again, I'd buy just the bottom fitted sheet.",1
1,"I have NEVER written a negative review about ANY product before.  Throw this product away, it was a nightmare come true for me today.  The suave \\""help\\"" line mearly took down my information and promised me a refund, even though this is going to cost me dearly.  I look like the end of a broom.  Clumps of my hair fell out and the strands I saved from the comb were mush.  The hair that did not fall out have lost all shine and are way more frizzy than when I started.  When I started my hair was all one length, now it looks like someone took a razor and put large uneven layers in my hair.  This is the worst mistake and most terrible purchase I've ever made.  This product should be taken off the shelves, Suave, you should be ashamed of yourselves.  I'll never trust your brand again.  I waited for my husband all day and his response was \\""at least you have cute hats.\\""  I was hoping someone would call me some advice. If it's an alkali product or an acidic product, give me some tips to neutralize it!  If my di-sulfide bonds are being destroyed, tell me how to stop the reaction.  No advice from the assistance line, I even talked to the manager and she said she's not a stylist.  I don't need a stylist, I need a chemist!  Somebody wake me up!",1
2.0,it doesn't help at all,1
1,"Have used Royal Secret powder for YEARS and while I've gotten used to the &#34;new&#34; fragrance, the powder itself it far from being powder!  It's too damp and doesn't go on correctly.  As a matter of fact, it won't even adhere to the puff!  I tried using a fork to see if that would help &#34;fluff it up&#34; and was stunned at the results.  It is actually clumpy and if you try to use the puff it just compresses the powder into a huge mass in the container.  Very disappointed to say the least and can't find out how to contact Five Star Fragrances directly.",1
2,It's an excellent product but unfortunately one of the three I bought came broken. Powder spread everywhere and $10+ lost now I'm out of the us for some time wishing for a refund on the broken one i had to throw away.,1
2,"good but not gold! 90 applications for the same product (step 1 and 2) was the same price only 2 months ago, and now you get 60 applications (step 1 and 2) for that price.I understand price increase, but a product going from $ 0.88 per application to $ 1.33  ($0.45 increase) is a genuine rip-off! Jacking up the price isn't going to make their product a success-people will buy less or switch brands.",1
2,I was excited to try this product and with the price being cheap I thought I should give it a try. I've tried Civant Skincare and Murad under eye creams with no noticeable effects. I put this on and after the first few days there seemed to be a small improvement but after that it stopped working. Overall it was a disappointing experience>,1
2,"I have acne-prone, combination skin. I've used this product and other aveeno facial moisturizers, and while all of them have worked alright in summer when my skin tends to be moister (and I need more sun protection), in winter when I tend to run dry, my face still peels when I use this. It's a lightweight lotion that feels good and not oily when it goes on, and doesn't appear to make my acne worse, but the trade-off may be a minimal level of moisture. In short, while the experience of using it is pleasant, I'm not sure it actually helps much.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, I also recently saw that this product contains parabens. While the FDA is still unconvinced that these are linked with cancer, I see no reason to risk using products that contain them when there are other options (that may work better!)",1
1,It was not the same scent I remember from High School Hence it was disappointing.  I did use it as a everyday cologne.,1
1,I purchased these to use with andis 63965 bgrc.  Does not fit so why call them universal?  I was dissapointed.,1
2,"I give this product two stars just because, the powder brush is the only one that actually works. I guess everyone has their own opinion, but in mine these brushes are not worth buying. its true that they pick up very little makeup, the small brushes like the shadow brush are too stiff and some maybe a little too chiseled. I guess they would be good for someone that uses really subtle makeup, because to apply makeup, specially if you like heavy makeup, you have to apply quite a few times to actually do it to your liking. Also some of the big brushes are too long and way too soft and that makes it really hard to use. I've seen a lot of complains about the smell of the bag, well for me it didn't bother me. it just kind of smelled liked new plastic. some of the tops do come loose and come off eventually. I rally wouldn't recommend theses brushes to anyone, I could find better brushes at a pharmacy, so that's a no good for me,",1
1,"When the grips went into the Ultrasonic for cleaning, the color anodizing came off...but not completely enough to not worry about the possibility of that stuff going into someone's skin with the ink.  Not a very sterile solution, I would suggest looking into other aluminum or composite solutions if you need a light weight grip.",1
1,Wig is pretty however the hair is very thinin the top and it sheds like crazy. The thinness is very bad.,1
1,"I felt compelled to write this because as a person who enjoys trying new makeup I was interested in this when I read positive articles online (promoted much maybe?) I very, very, rarely give one star reviews.<br />The marketing was good (let's face it Sophia Vergara is beautiful and can really sell products) and it looked like an interesting new concept. Nope. Really bad product, horrible delivery. I am not a high end makeup person,  with a few exceptions,  (can't afford it and think it's a waste of money when trying new products)  I usually buy drugstore/ box store brand items because generally the quality is comparable. I have had great success many covergirl products and they are usually especially good with mascara.<br /> Ugh. and so I feel compelled to warn you: 1) the product is two sided: Side one tolerable thinish mascara could maybe be usable but not great. Bristles are wider spiral like more old school mascara wands. Side two: horrible, sticky, thick clumpy formula. (I actually fished the packaging out of the trash can thinking maybe I'd bought some horrible version of waterproof mascara by mistake, nope) My lashes were literally sticking together at the ends of my eyelids ( and I didn't even  apply it to the lower lashes) Brush has more dense fluffy bristles. 2) The delivery: the wands are so short and stumpy that it makes it hard to apply if you have any cheekbones at all. The wands are super think and clunky. (maybe ok for people with hand difficulties/ limited dexterity?)  Removal is horrible. Also, looked like Mimi from the Drew Carey show- google it (with much fear- makeup users)<br /> So, other reviewers have countered with the thoughts that the person applying either didn't know how to apply it (hey, it's not the product's fault, it's you!) or that the person did not purchase the correct make up remover. Ok. fair enough, but if this required special specific remover it should be written in large print so a reasonable person could purchase it at thesame time.  Cover girl, shame on you, I know you can do better, I've seen you do much better. (Clump crusher by lashblast/ covergirl is amazing) This product is a bomb. Save your money. I want my $10.00 back.",1
1,"Maybe because this product was discontinued it is bad.  I have used this product for years and have never had a bottle like this one.  It goes on very strong and then it is gone.  Usually, the fragrance will linger on my skin all day, but this is gone within 30 minutes.  I would have returned it, but since I knew the fragrance, I threw away the packaging.  I really wonder if it was a fake.  What a waste of money.  Don't buy!",1
1,"I have returned TWO of these due to them arriving IN PIECES!! Who is responsible? WHO KNOWS!! Its Sold by Furniture Creations and Fulfilled by Amazon. Did Amazon ship it? Furniture Creations? Whoever it was \\""TWICE\\"" was an idiot TWICE!!!",1
2,"When I first tried this product I liked it and could tell a difference in the length, but it does not seem to be worth the trouble. Everytime I check the mirror there are more fibers stuck onto my eyelids up to my eyebrows/under eyes, just sticks to all my makeup,,, they just keep coming off throughout the day. I was hoping this would be a great product, because I did not want to pay for the more expensive, &#34;younique&#34;, so I will stick with my mascara for now",1
1,All I'm going to say is  you can definitely tell it's cheap 👎👎,1
2,It would probably work the way it claims for smaller feet.  Does not work well for my size 13 foot.,1
1,"The old formula was a GREAT product, and very unique. Good hold and texture. This new stuff is awful. You get less, and the formula is different. The hold is way, way, way worse.",1
2,"This product is not very good compared to my conair shaver that has now been discontinued! I have cut myself several times while shaving. You have to use it very carefully. However, this company shipped it on time and the packaging was very well done.",1
1,Ge careful of the quality!  These cut chunks out of my hair!!! :(,1
2,"I decided to try a more expensive shaving cream to see if there was anything more I could get out of my morning shave. I had heard a lot about Kiehl's, but it really didn't do anything for me. I've settled on Nivea For Men Sensitive, which is much cheaper, and works a lot better.    It was hard to get any sort of a lather from this shave cream. It took too much of the cream to create good coverage for my face, and took a considerable amount of time compared to your regular, pressurized can. Sometimes I could feel a nice tingle, which I admit I do enjoy, but this was also inconsistent.    It can be fun to splurge and feel like you have some great stuff, but unless you really feel the need to have someone else see you buying this or sitting in your bathroom, you'll be better off going simple.",1
1,I am a hairdresser of 14 years. I know what qualities these extensions should posess. This hair is poor quality. It tangles almost instantly and the color rinses out. The color is not burgundy or red at all. It's orange.,1
1,awful.,1
2,I rated this a 2 because I ordered the wrong shampoo. I'm sure it will be good for those that use this type shampoo.,1
1,Wasn't in the container they show. Also had a gritty feel to it and it has a horrible odor.,1
1,"Never worked, brand new batteries and all was bought. Unit NEVER started. Had to buy one at a local store.",1

1,"I wish I could give 0 stars for not being the Salux brand as advertised. The reason I ordered it was specifically because I wanted the Salux brand and the only reason I didn't return it was because I didn't want to deal with the hassle, time, and expense of shipping this thing back during the busy holiday season. As I understand it (and I may be wrong) Salux is a specific brand so to say something is Salux when in fact it does not say Salux on the package would be false advertising. I really feel ripped off and taken advantage of.",1
1,If you're looking for bright orange hair...this is the stuff! YIKES!!!,1
1,This is a terrible product. Both of the tubes of the fiber lashes is very dry and are hard to apply. Black colored specks fall on your face messing up the rest of your makeup. I would not recommend this product.,1
1,awful color,1
1,"I am always looking for ways to improve the way my hair looks - it is in good condition with streaks of natural silver, thought this product would make the silver shine.<br />Found it difficult to get the right amount, had to be very very careful to have just a little bit of the product on my hand before putting on the hair.<br />This did absolutely nothing in regards to making my hair shine - could see no difference at all.<br />No - I would not encourage folks to buy it.",1
2,"I first tried pink package BB cream from the same brand and liked it, but though that this will give me more matte coverage according to some other reviews. Unfortunately, this cream color is literary white and it will stay like that even on my fair skin. Because of this I was not able to blend it any way (tried hands, sponges, brushes) with my skin to make it look natural. It is very matte and it will accentuate even the smallest dry spot on the face which I found somewhat extreme for a BB cream.<br />I didn't like it because of the color, but some people may have more luck. I may go back to the pink version.",1

1,"The smell of pumpkin can't mask the insane burning from this stuff. I emailed twice for guidance to make sure I was do everything correctly. My face scabbed, like I had been dragged behind a Jeep going 4x4ing thru a field of cacti. It burned even after the the stuff was off. The baking soda mixture, which was supposed to neutralize the burn, for some reason, created a nuclear reaction on my face, splitting atoms, and recreating a miniature Hiroshima across my cheeks. I considered going to the ER, but felt like an idiot. It took several days to heal, but since the reply email from the company was that they would &#34;talk me through the first peel,&#34; I assumed I had made a mistake and I tried again when the skin was healed. It was an exact repeat of the first episode. I may as well have put a blow torch to my face. And as for the &#34;rewnewed skin cells?&#34; Nothing. Nada. Same old face as before this weapon of mass destruction was put to it.<br />Seriously, how is this even allowed outside a laboratory?",1

1,Worked one time....the gel packs became hard afterwards.....the warmth was so far away from my eyes that I had to press on goggles to feel the heat.....waste of precious $ because no longer can afford Restasis....,1
1,"whoo, not my smell.",1
1.0,This is NOT foundation! It is pressed powder...I was lied to! Ordered this product thinking that it was foundation as it states in the desciption and now I am stuck with something I will never use!,1
1,Sent wrong item.  To many hours trying to get it right.  Do not recommend...,1
1,This product did not meet my expectations!  We bought it for the blue (my daughter was Lagoona Blue for Halloween) and it did not show up in her blond hair.,1
1,Looked like something from the dollar store. Nothing like the picture!,1
2,Even though it is the same wattage it does not seem to have any power.  I am sure that it is every dryer,1
2.0,So far I amq disappointed.  Does not remove hair well on face.,1
1.0,I dont believe this really is a Redkin product! My hair dresser warned me that imposters are on amazon and I didnt believe her until I bought this! Save yourself the money and spurge on the real product at your salon!,1
2.0,Didn't care for it. Crumbly and messy. Ended up pitching it.,1
1,"This product was way too harsh on my sensitive skin, and the cleanser inside was breaking me out really bad.",1

1,"Received package and one of the tubes wouldn't pump, I have to open and stick a qtip in which makes me think this was a reject package or something because for the price paid, it should work perfectly!!!",1
1,"I used to be addicted to the brown/nutmeg shade: It used to be very easy to apply and I used to love the fact that you were supposed to apply to damp hair (made it much easier). The result with the brown/nutmeg on my naturally dark-brown hair, used to be just a deeper tone of brown with tons of shine. I used to apply it especially after the summer, when my hair was stripped of its shine because of the pool/sun/ocean water mix.  So at the end of this summer a few weeks ago, I went to buy the product and to my surprise the box had changed. I though \\""ok, they say the formula is the same, so I'll give it a try\\"". Big mistake. To start with, you now apply the product to dry hair- Which makes me think \\""humm, they definitely changed the formula, but I will still give it a try\\"", but the new smell is HORRIBLE! This is supposed to be an ammonia-free formula, but it now smells like any other permanent, super strong hair color. Also, I did not get the instant shine I used to see with the other formula even before I dried my hair. It has also made hair EXTREMELLY dry. But the worst part is that it has LIGHTENED MY HAIR!! As I mentioned before, my hair is naturally a really dark brown, and I right now am looking at a brassy, shine-less, medium brown hair that looks like I applied a shade that is at least 2 tones lighter than my natural hair! I am horrified!!!  And needless to say, NEVER using this product again. And seriously Clairol, are you REALLY going to keep saying your formula hasn't changed??",1
2,My 2 stars are my fault. When the seller states the are large hair bands they mean LARGE. Too big for my thin hair.,1
2.0,"I got this primarily because my wedding was coming up. & I regret waiting anxiously for this disappointment. I've gotten better results from the glue I got on ebay. 2 Days with proper care and NO touching and NO water, the lashes fell out even though I used a good amount.",1

2,"I had a higher end Norelco shaver for years and until recently, always got a &#34;close as a razor&#34; shave. For the price of new shaving heads, I decided to chuck the shaver and get a new one.<br /><br />This product will just not shave close. You are always left with stubble you can feel. If you want something reasonably close, you have to spend 5+ minutes going over the same areas over and over.<br /><br />Unlike my old shaver, the recommendation for this shaver is to not use it while plugged in. I don't understand that restriction.<br /><br />Recommendation for charging if 8 hours. Why? Plus, there is no indication that charging is complete. They couldn't make the light blink like my old shaver. My old shaver charged in one hour.<br /><br />I am sorry I tossed my old shaver and I probably am going to return this product.",1
1.0,Did not work for me.  I had to return the first one because as soon as I plugged it in to charge the adapter sparked and smoked.,1

2.0,Scraps skin,1
1,I do not see how to use them as texturizers.  Does anyone know?  Neither texturizing blade opposes a cutting blade.,1

1,Terrible the brushes are stiff not soft very hard to use I tossed it aside,1
1,"I love the *product,* because I spray glitter in my hair every day. HOWEVER...it does not work, very quickly. The spray mechanism stops working. I need to find an empty spray bottle, to see if that will work. :(",1
1,This sells for around $50 for the same size on the Aesop website.  Kind of disgusting that it is selling for $170 here.,1
2,"I wanted to really like this product but when i put it in my air and washed it off, my hair just felt really oily and gross. I don't know if I'm applying it wrong or leaving it in for too long (like 20 minutes) but I guess ill give it another try.",1
1,"My synthetic pink cosplay wig was nice and shiny at first but was a bit tangled and I wanted to tone down the curls that it was already styled in when I bought it. I heard that this product would make it shinier and smell good along with detangling your wig so I thought to try it out. I did not like the results one bit. The strands initially detangled after a good amount of sprays on one area (which was already wet with water like the instructions tell you to do) but then after letting it air-dry, it became hard and the hair looked like a gross mess. After combing through the entire wig again, it finally looked decent but it was definitely not as shiny as it was before. I am dissatisfied with this product.",1
1.0,"You can't see this eyeliner once applied. It's really thin, but kind of watery so you can't build layers. I guess it would be nice if you had darker skin, or just wanted kind of a \\""wet\\"" look on the eyelid. Personally, I would not buy this again.",1
1,"I got very disappointed when I got this product. I thought it was bigger...it's very small. When I saw the picture, it seemed to be a big bottle; however it is not-just 1oz. You can get a bigger bottom at Sally, whole foods much cheaper.",1
1,"10 months into owning this shaver it stopped being able to charge or clean in the stand. This because the shaver would move around during the cleaning process, tricking the stand into thinking it wasn't in the stand at all. I called Braun and was told that I had to ship the unit, at my expense, a few hundred miles to the nearest service center. I also had to call the service center myself to set this up. They would provide no time frame for resolution of the problem. They wouldn't guarantee that it was covered by the warranty, so once the service center got it, I could face charges for getting it fixed. And in the meantime I had to buy another shaver.    Check around. This is a common problem with this shaver. For this much money, Braun should treat its customers better. I won't be buying from them again, and I suggest you not either.",1
2,doesn't smell too good  weird odor  and the smell is gone within minutes of applying  Too bad I usually like Jessica's stuff.,1
1,"Never received product. I called to let them know. They basically told me \\""I dont know what to tell you. We mailed it.\\"" I basically had no choice but to eat the cost. I will never order from them again.",1
2,"I wish I could give it 1.5 stars.  I'm so torn between hating or semi liking it.  The ONLY reason I didn't give it a completely awful review is because it does fulfill one part of the product description-which is getting tangles out.  Other than that, I either purchased the wrong &#34;wet brush&#34; or the raving reviews I have heard and seen from family, friends, and strangers are straight up lies.<br /><br />They aren't joking when they say the bristles are flexible.  After my second use, a bunch of the bristles were completely bent.  Even before that happened, while brushing your hair, the bristles just collapse on your head.  I have no idea how this product actually works when that happens.  I have fine hair, so it's not like my hair actually beats the brush up.  I was just looking for something that wasn't so harsh on my hair when it was wet.  It is, however, great as a shower brush to make sure the shampoo and conditioner distribute evenly, and is painless in doing so.  Other than that, this brush would be in the trash.<br /><br />Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT attempt to use this brush while blow drying your hair.  Almost immediately I smelled burning, and sure enough many bristles were melted.  So sure, it gets rid of the tangles, but with poor quality and longevity.",1
1,Maybe I'm using it wrong but I can't get it to scrape anything off,1
1,Extremely hard to use. Product stuck to my skin event with the Pre Epilation Oil. Wax broke off in different areas.,1
2,"After using these for several weeks, I found that they leak and the essential oil blends caused the glue to separate the bottle and cover. I was very disappointed.",1
1,it arrived broken. i fixed it and i realized it was like faceing the wrong way....like its kinda hard to explain but like i cant where it because its was made the wrong way. blah o might take it apart and jus use the ear peice and the comb separate.,1
1,"Ever looking for the safest and most comfortable way to shave, I ordered a Microtouch One razor when I saw it advertised on TV. I should have done some research first because it turned out to be a mistake. My first observation has to do with quality. At the price of $19.95 and up I'd expect it to be at least good if not excellent. But close inspection of the item reveals a cheap rehash of an old classic, probably manufactured in China at bargain rates to the distributor (who no doubt is making a killing in the spread). My second point is that the bulky design makes it a difficult item to handle in some parts of the face, such us under the nose or where the neck joins the jaw. (These are places that a modern disposable easily navigates.) But the most dissatisfying issue with this product is the &#34;safety&#34; factor. These types of razors were probably dubbed &#34;safety&#34; razors when compared to a barber's super sharp open switch blade, but they are not all that safe compared to today's modern disposables or not so disposables. I shaved with the Microtouch three times (twice more than I really wanted to but wanted to give it a fair try) and finally conceded that I had been duped (ripped off). All three shaves were uncomfortable, worrisome (it always felt like there was too much razor blade exposed to the skin) and, in fact, I did cut myself once despite being careful not to. In short, there was nothing comfortable to using a Microtouch and I really do get much closer and more comfortable shaves from my disposables. I do not recommend the Microtouch product. Only those who are married to the idea of using a classic design, despite the discomfort and safety concerns, could enjoy this product.",1
1,"This product didn't work for me, as described.  <br /> <br />First of all, it does smell nice, which is different from the usual fumes nail polishes give off! Smells lemony!  <br /> <br />Its also easy to use - you brush it on over nails and surrounding area, let it set for awhile until it gets dull and then gently buff it off with a tissue.  <br /> <br />That was all fine and dandy, but it didn't leave my nails all that dry, nor did it leave them shiny. In fact, they were less shiny than the shiny topcoats I use.  <br /> <br />I also had the worse case of bedsheet wrinkles embedded in my manicure that night after using this product - could be unrelated, but I've never seen so many creases and smudges in my nails when I woke up and I let them dry for a few hours after painting them!  <br /> <br />I wouldn't recommend this product.",1
1.0,This hair is really really thin for the amount you pay for it. I might as well go in to the beauty store and buy it there very very disappointed.,1
1,Not the best,1
1,"As others have stated, this item is not new and comes in a plain white box. It appeared to have been cleaned, but there were several scuff marks on the handle. I guess you are not guaranteed to get a quality product just because it is &#34;Fulfilled By Amazon&#34;. I returned the razor with no problems.",1
1,Was expecting something great considering it's been around since 1932.  It's loud and cheap -- I threw it out.,1
1,I bought the 3 floz size for about $3 at WalMart and was hoping I could use this lotion daily but I hate the smell and feel. The smell is very strong and to me it smells very pungent and acidic rather than smooth vanilla and oatmeal. The texture feels like a thin layer that stays on my skin rather than entering it. I can rub my hands together and it will coagulate and come off. I'm not buying this brand again.,1
1,"They are way too heavy! And you can't return them. Don't believe the other reviews. I am a good consumer and buy lots of \\""stuff\\"" off the internet. I am not a paid reviewer.

1,These curling irons don't curl one's hair.  What a waste of money!!!!,1
1.0,I tried this product for 2 months plus and didn't see any improvement at all.<br />I went to see if I could return it and it was too late.,1
2,stinks to like a skunk! stinks so bad you can taste in in the back of your throat! tried using it but cant get past the smell to see if it works...,1
1,It works really well if you hold in place for a really long time. It is super heavy and hurts your hand after awhile wouldn't recommend it. & the box was torn up when I got it.,1
1,Cheaply made,1
1,"This wig is horrible and nothing like the picture. I completely regret buying this wig. I saw the identical wig (package, brand and number) in my local wig shop. It fit and felt beautiful on me. This is not the same wig. The quality, color and fit aren't even close (rough and dull). I couldn't leave the house once it looked so bad. There return policy has so many fees (shipping, restocking) and rules they can reject the item for that it's really not worth the time. Complete rip off. I wish someone would investigate this company to see if they are filling low quality wigs in high quality boxes. This wig even looks previously used. Never from this company again! Complete waste of time and money!",1
1,"This product broke me out something crazy. Even my bf who never comments on my skin asked me why I was breaking out so much. I gave it to my little brother and it also broke him out. As a reference I am very very oily, acne prone, clog prone. He has normal but acne prone skin.",1
1,I bought a Proactive deep cleansing brush a few months ago and was very disappointed. The brushes don't move and the whole thing only vibrates. For any use or results at all you have to press pretty hard and move it around. You could basically get the same results with a washcloth.,1
2,Very beautiful but too small!!,1
1,I RETURNED THIS KNOCKOFF FLAT IRON (WAS SUPPOSED TO BE T3) AND AM STILL WAITING FOR A REFUND AFTER 3 MONTHS.  NO REPLY FROM SELLER AND NO REPLY FROM AMAZON!  WHAT A SHAM!,1
2,This item is beautiful but it's so small that my very tiny teenage girl could barely ware it.  Be aware this runs VERY small!!!,1
1,"I have lots of breakage and thought this shampoo would help my hair. It does not. As a matter of fact, it seams that more hair comes out when I use it. I tried to compare with my husbands head and shoulder shampoo, and I lost half the hair with his shampoo. I think I will never buy this shampoo again. It does nothing for my hair. I loss about 100 hair strands with it each time.",1

1.0,JUNK BROKE IN ABOUT A MONTH,1
1,"I received this as a gift and had chosen it based on the colors on the picture on Amazon.  The colors that were shipped are not at ALL like the colors pictured.

At least the brushes are decent, so I can use them.  Wish I could use the colors!",1

2,"When I received this package today, I was SO EXCITED. But when I opened it, I was disappointed and angry. Even though it's not as bad as others, one of the eye shadows were all smashed and broken. Even though it's just one shadow, I expect what I order to be in the best condition possible. And that surely wasn't it. And the palette and box holding it was FIL-THY. * I * had to clean it for Christ's sake. The palette didn't even look NEW. It looked crappy and like it had already been used. I understand it's from overseas, but the very least they could do is put a fragile label on it so the other people handling the package don't toss it around and treat it any sort of way. After all, eye shadow IS fragile. And from what I've read, I'm not the only person that has experienced a broken shadow or two in the palette. They should really work on trying to make sure that that doesn't happen to anyone anymore. We shouldn't have to go through this. We pay our money to receive nice, top-of-the-line products. We don't want a broken up, dirty dusty palette in the mail thinking that we're going to get something better. Ridiculous.",1
2,I guess I have a big head or something because it felt really tight on my head. So then I changed out the elastic for a bigger one that I had at home! It was still too tight! I guess I'll reuse the roses to make some other type of jewelry.,1
1,"I like the fact that the dryer is very light weight, but I think I have used toy versions that blow harder. OMG.... I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt, and use it in the salon, and it caused me to run way behind. Every client I gave up after 15-30 min and used another dryer. I think it is comparable to using a diffuser to get a strait sleek look.... unfortunately I'm not impressed. I'm sending it back.",1
2,i bought this colour  coz it looked pretty and it is pretty but it just started chipping off the next day. Also for application I had to apply a number of coats to give it a proper finishing. May be its just for this colour but would think twice before purchasing it again,1
2,"Maybe it is my face, but I find that this razor doesn't work as good as the cheaper Gillette sensor. It seems to be the angle. This razor takes up a larger area than the sensor, so it doesn't reach into areas like clefts or turns (chin area, jaw line) as well. It works better on a flat area, like legs for example. My fiancee uses it for shaving her legs and likes it better, but I don't care for it.",1
1.0,I bought this to use for Halloween ..... I wouldn't waste my money on it .. It is like barbie doll hair you can't comb it or curl it and it is not enough for a full head of hair ..... You get what you pay for!!!!!!,1
1,There is a reason it is so cheap... it last for about an hour then its gone...i have worn Eternity for years and it lasts for quite a while.... not this stuff...i did a test on my right and left wrist of my old bottle and the new i just received... the old bottle lasted all day...new bottle faded within the hour...dont buy this product... it is watered down...,1
1,It does not work as advertised. when you apply polish to the stencil it does not work as is should as per instructed,1

2,"I am a loyal user of Keys Solar RX 30+ SPF for 3+ years, but I ordered this tinted version by mistake. When I first pumped it out, I thought, &#34;Wow, there's a tinted version,&#34; and I was happy about the mistake. I have fair skin, so the untinted version works okay for me, but I would like a slightly tinted version. I've attached a picture to help show the difference and what I'm going to explain about this version.<br />First, I've used it only once, so I can't confirm that it works the same for me and what I love about the original for my acne- and rosacea-prone skin because the original soothes, moisturizers, and covers my skin so nicely.<br />Next, I can't use this because the SHIMMER is so unnatural that it just looks weird; see the picture. The tinted is on the left and spread out above it to show shimmer. It is dry. I did the same on the right with the original. There's no shimmer there, and you can see that it doesn't really have a white cast either.<br />I am giving two stars because I would love to have tinted version, and this company produces a great original product, so I have faith they will get this figured out.<br />I hope Keys does not change the original formula to be shimmery like this.",1
2,"This is the first time I have ever used plastic rods and will be the last. I like the idea you can reuse them but they dont mold to your eye.

I do like the solutions are colored though...thats about it.",1
2,"I was super excited to receive this product! I had such high hopes after reading so many positive reviews. However, I ended up disappointed. While it may have added some volume, it left my hair very dry. It felt as if I hadn't used conditioner at all. I usually do not have a difficult time combing my hair, but as I said, after using this, it felt like I hadn't used any conditioner at all! The conditioner was a huge disappointment! The scent was masculine. On another note, I have used Alterna's instant repair rx shampoo and conditioner, and loved it! Think I'll go back to that!",1

After using about 10-15 minutes a day most days of one year, it is junk.  I will replace it with a more well known brand name and hope that their lightbulbs can be replaced.",1
1,"I received a box with a sample size Angel perfume?!? It clearly states \\""Sample Only. Not for Sale\\"" on the package.

1,"I tried my Panasonic ES8228S razor for the first time today.  After about three seconds, I pulled it away from my face, shut it off, and stared at it.  Was that thing really that loud?  I turned it on and tried shaving again.  It made my ear hurt on the side I was shaving.  Calling it loud is an understatement.  I couldn't bear to have that thing running anywhere near my face.<br /><br />I own a Simpson 886-2 sound level meter.  (I use it for setting up surround sound systems.)  It seemed like a good idea to test this razor against my old Norelco that I've been using for years.  The Norelco measured around 73 dBA; the Panasonic pushed the meter to 82 dBA.  That's actually dangerously loud.<br /><br />Prolonged exposure to noises of 85 dBA and above will cause hearing damage.  That's on average.  Some people may find that sounds at levels even lower than 85 dBA are damaging.  Also keep in mind that as the source is moved closer to your ears, the sound level increases.  In this case, since the razor is used to shave your face, it will be very close to your ears.  No wonder it hurt.<br /><br />I packed the razor up and contacted Amazon for a return slip.  It's bad enough that I'm nearsighted.  I'm not risking going deaf, too.",1
2,OK. Does not live up to advertisement.,1

I was so excited to do this but after I was so disappointed . I drank all the water I needed to and ate healty. And still didn't work! And the shipping was horrible. They put it in a bag not even a little box. When I got the wraps it was bent, folded just not how you want your package to show up. And also the shipping took forever.....

2,"I've been a fan of heated curlers for most of my adult life, and 3 of the 4 sets of curlers I've owned were Remington.  This, in theory should be the best, but it is most definitely not.  Why?  Because the rods that heat the curlers and clips get hot enough to melt the clips.  The curlers are therefore a bit hot to handle, even for people like myself, who have high tolerance for heat.  But to make matters worse, the plastic on the edges of the clips melts onto the heating bars.  I can't quite figure why this happens with only some of the curlers and not all.  But I have to cool the unit down completely, then take a kitchen knife to scrape off the red plastic.  If I use it long enough I'll either have red tipped hair or all the clips will be 'clipped' and short enough they won't continue to melt.<br /><br />What I like about it: It heats up in 90 seconds (perhaps that fast heating is why it also melts in 90 seconds).  If Remington would solve the 'overheating' problem, this would be a great appliance.",1
1,"I couldn't get this to work properly. The scraper tool included did not scrape of excess polish. I tried to use my own card (tried multiple cards on multiple image plates) and it also did not fully remove excess polish, just smeared it. I tried the stamper anyway just to see if the transfer would work if I were able to eventually get a clean image to work with. Multiple attempts later, a full image never transferred. There was always a section missing. Threw it away.",1
2,"Its' good moisturizer but the smell is not great, especially since it's on your face...",1
2,The bottle was already opened when I received the package and the contents had spilled inside the envelope. Unfortunately I had to send it back.,1
1,ok if zero stars was an option that would be my rating. I put it in my hair at 12 pm it is now 10pm and its still burning. and yes I washed every ounce of the relaxer out it just sucks! BEWARE IF U<br />WANT UR HAIR! burns the second u put it on. smh im just so pissed im done with the review please dnt buy this CRAP,1
2,I bought this product and am about to return it. There is any reference anywhere to the fact that this is a dry kind of shaver. Therefore my rate.,1
1,I had to return this curling iron as it burnt my hair on a medium setting.  Amazon's return policy is terrific!,1
2,Fantastic scent and I get a lot of compliments on it! Problem is it wears off after less than 2 hours. I end up spraying a lot more on in an effort to keep the scent. Everyone I talk to says after 2 hours it's completely gone.,1
1,You can get this at Sephora for $26. And you can skin match among 5 shades of choices. Why would anyone pay double for this on amazon?,1
1,"very faint.  seems to last about 30 minutes.  smells \\""watered down\\"" - the correct scent is there (I have purchased previously from Macy's) just fractional.  not impressed.  would not recommend.",1
2,"It was too small and not conducive to what I needed.  I was going to take it to the hospital for after surgery, but it just did not work as I expected.",1
2,"The large rollers snap off from both ends as I'm putting them on. Smaller one's are more sturdy. The satin on the rollers is really cheap and begin shedding off the sides from day one and is kind of slippery as you try to put them on. Hair slides off easily so you have to hold real tight when applying them. The satin isn't going to last. They should have added seams to the satin. Using the small rolers gives gorgeous curls. And NO, it's not like sleeping with pillows all over your head. I don't care what anyone says, sleeping with rollers is very uncomfortable feeling.",1
2,I wanted to use the productt and write this review. I used it daily for 3 weeks now and dont see any difference to my skin. It is watery in consistency and doesen't feel anything. I think it is not worth a purchase.,1
2,"I purchased this self-cut kit here on Amazon about three months ago for $30. The first time I used it was great - it cut like a charm. The second time I tried (about two months later), not so much. Other reviews on here have stated that their battery lasted \\""months\\"", but my experience has been that it lasts barely long enough for one full haircut, then starts sputtering during use. Now the clipper makes an awful racket when turned on and it barely cuts at all, more like rips hair out than cutting.    At any rate, it DID save me from paying for two $15 haircuts, so it (barely) paid for itself. I'm hoping that maybe I just got a bad one, or it's an easy fix, but so far I haven't been able to get any help from WAHL (the manufacturer) or their website. The site is basically just an online brochure, and the phone number I found is just an automated system that quickly turns into a maze of options.    If the problems I'm seeing aren't typical, then I would recommend this clipper kit. Otherwise, don't bother. Unfortunately, at the moment, I can't tell which it is...    Also, AN IMPORTANT NOTE: Even the longest guide that comes with this set is pretty darn short. If you wear your hair in any style longer than a buzz-cut or really close-trimmed business cut, this won't work for you without much longer guides, and the biggest one that WAHL sells on their site is a #12 (1.5 inch cut).",1

1,These are not the same color but luckily I like the colors. Definitely not heat resistant I tried straightening the ends and it smelled like motor fuel. They come crimped because they are folded into a tiny package. All around not impressed with anything but the price. I guess you get what you pay for.,1
2,It just didn't hold up well. Within 3 weeks it was a tangled mess. I was disappointed that tje quality was better,1
2,Added a drop.. nothing.. added 2 drops.. nothing.. added 3 drops.. NOTHING!!!  Provided no scent what so ever... very disappointing...,1
1,I got allergies all of the face.,1
1,"This eye liner (In BLACK) is very dark. I have very dark eyes and lashes, so getting black is a must for me. Well, when I first purchased and used this liner for the first time, I loved it. It is MUCH darker than any other eye liner pencil I have used. I used this liner to line under my lashes and thought, well why not try to do above?! WRONG! It goes on pretty thick and I know what I'm doing with liner, but no matter what I tired, it was going on thick.<br /><br />So, the next time I stuck with just lining under my lashes and sticking with my liquid liner above. So, the time came to SHARPEN this liner. I looked everywhere on the pencil and found the bottom twists. Well, that's great except it does nothing. I sat here like an idiot for three minutes twisting. I finally \\""googled\\"" it and EVERYONE is having the same issue. You CAN use a sharpener, but most of the people that did this said it was just a mess and in most cases, they lost half the pencil. I'm not even going there. I will not be buying this one again!",1
1,"I bought the entire line of red enhancing John Freida products including shampoo, conditioner and glaze. After using these products for 2 weeks, my highlights still weren't evenly tinted plus my hair was probably in the worst condition it has ever been in! I switched back to Kerastase products and included Ted Gibson conditioner in captivating copper, which I use by adding a small amount to my Kerastase condtioner. Wow, no comparison! My hair is looking great again and the TG keeps the highlights beautifully tinted even though I only add it to my conditioner twice per week! I had initially skipped over the TG and went for the JF because of reviews and price but in the end I wasted my money on the JF products which are some of the worst I have ever used! The TG colored conditioner is by far less costly since it works so well and I use a very small amount only twice per week. The bottle will probably last me at least 6 months to a year.",1
2,"This would be a great set if the zippers were longer and off to one side.  My wife wants to set it flat on the counter and open it from the top.  You can't do that.  It has to be set on its side and opened like it shows in the picture.  Otherwise, well made.",1
1,"This is a torture impliment.     If you are into S&M, maybe you'll like it and the random hairs that it pulls out, along with the roots.     Don't bother, trust me.

However, when I got my shipment in the mail it's the newer one that ABBA has available. I was very disappointed.",1

1,"Bought in January 2013.  It is now 4 months later and I went to turn it on this morning, and it wouldn't heat up.  Tried different outlets and nothing.  Just quit on me.  It was used maybe 4 times a week for maybe 5 minutes at a time.  Unfortunately, I cannot return since its past its window and wouldn't be able to anyway since I believe I threw out the original packaging (lesson learned).  I'm assuming I was just unlucky and received a defective one out of the bunch because I know this is a good curling iron.  Worked very well during its short life.  What a bummer.",1
2,"I've used products with the same ingredients that work much better than this product. For one, the smell is extremely strong and unpleasant (this is obviously subjective, but in case you are sensitive to that sort of thing). Secondly, where as the other products I've used have made my hair have defined, silky curls, this one leaves my hair frizzy and looking strange. Wouldn't buy again.",1
2,"Reading the seller's listing, you think that you are getting a \\""pack of 3\\"" toothbrushes, which includes both the hulk and wolverine.  Not so.  You get ONE toothbrush and whichever character the seller wants or has available apparently.  I wanted the hulk for my 4 year old son and the seller sent wolverine.  When I inquired about the problem and misleading nature of the listing, the seller didn't acknowledge a problem.  Buyer beware.",1

1,"This is way, way, way smaller than the product states.",1
1,"Sadly the ST Dupont Signature did not smell like a fragrance someone would want to use. No star or minus one star would be the more appropriate rating. It's been my fragrance of choice in this form for over 10 years and I've purchased it on line before from other vendors. It was fully wrapped in cellophane as it should be. However, it smelled like citronella...or close to it. I've repackaged it and plan to send back to the vendor. We'll see their thoughts.",1
1,The name says it all.  NO NO don't buy this.  A real rip off.  I would give it 0 stars but that was not a choice.,1

1,"This shampoo, along with its conditioner, caused much hair breakage.  I had to quit using it.",1

1.0,I love ion flat irons but not this one. after about a year I picked it up about to iron my hair and the plate literally just melted off...like wet money just tilted right over. I went to sallys and bought a 25 dollar iron that works even better...,1
2,i don't like this &#34;air&#34; flosser.  i thought it would be less messy than a true &#34;waterpik&#34; but it isn't.  the water ends us all over the mirror.  the reservoir for the water is too small to complete the job.  would NOT recommend.  have gone back to my waterpik.,1

I had tried the US Prep H and had some good results, but read that there is rebound from its ingredients - so I tried the Canadian.  I had absolutely no results with this product.  I am very disappointed.  I gave it two stars instead of one, because I assume it still works for its originally intended purpose.  I don't have any wrinkles, so I haven't tried it for that.",1

The clips don't work very well if at all, letting the rollers fall out of your hair. The curlers themselves get stuck in my hair, and the curls only last about an hour. This was the worst curler set I've ever tried.",1
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! I received this facewash and was excited to use it because of the tea tree. I was so wrong! It was so watery im not sure if that how the product should be. I washed my face with it anyway. It had a terrible smell and  not to mention after using this product for a week my face started to break out terribly. I have extremely sensitive skin that is prone to scaring. Now I have to start ALL over again because my skin had that much of a terrible reaction. I would recommend everyone to STAY AWAY from this facewash if you have sensitive scar prone skin.,1

2,"This would be a perfectly fine moisturizer with spf if the pump actually worked.  I've read several reviews on different websites where people had the same problem.  The pump doesn't have a tube attached to it so you have to turn the bottle upside down to get it to work and even then, it only works occasionally because air gets into the dispenser and sprays it everywhere.  For a high-end moisturizer, you waste half of it trying to get a good squirt out of the bottle.  Seriously, don't buy this!!",1

My friend told me that she used this as a preventative care, though I in general didn't put any cream if my daughter's butt was perfect.  If I had used this, wouldn't she get diaper rash?

He's been so upset over this and I am just so disappointed.<br />I don't have time in my life to repackage it up and go to the UPS office that is 15 minutes away because it's a hassle when we go out so I am absolutely irate about this situation.<br />If it's poor quality don't sell it, you don't know how your actions could be affecting the person's life that ordered it and now has to deal with the consequences.",1
1.0,The product left my skin feeling dried out. Don't believe the product measured up to all the hype.,1
2,I am in my first bottle but still a very slow progress.,1
1,"So I ordered this on 8/2 came on 8/9...not bad. However it is NOT what I ordered, its not the mascara in the picture, it is urban decay, but not the one it advertises. The one I like the one that has the FLUFFY brush. The one that came in the mail has the little tiny plasticy bristles, which don't really work that well for my eyelashes, since they're already pretty thick. So, basically false advertising. Thanks beauty reduced!",1
1.0,This is just about as bad as the crappy mascara that your supposed to wear over top!!! It really does not work. Don't waste your money!!!!!!,1
2,"After reading several good reviews, I decided to give this a try. Its a good price so I thought, &#34;why not?&#34; Well, it didn't give me the blow dryer+ round brush results I get from my hairdresser. Not even close. Its not a bad product, but my hair is very finicky and this was not the solution. I was hoping I could use this and not have to use a chi straightener on my hair anymore, but no such luck. My hair is thick, but fine, and extremely wavy/curly. Most days I just leave it that way, but sometimes I like to straighten it. Guess I'll stick with the blow dryer and chi since I have decided to return this. Maybe some of you will have better luck than I!",1
1,I didn't even know eyebrows could go so high on the face. Nope not for me.,1
1,Cheaply made don't waste your money.,1
2,"I tried this product and didn't like it all that much. I tried to apply it as thinly as I could. I even got three nails out of one application. No matter how long I let it cure under a UV lamp, it stayed wet. I gave up.",1
2,"I tried this product recently at the beach because I was outside at night and was getting nailed by mosquitoes.  I am one of those people that is outside for an hour and comes in with at least 7 new bites.  Anyway, it seemed to do a pretty good job them and I only probably got 1.  I decided to buy it for myself and took it to a crab feast - boy, was I wrong.  I got eaten alive still, but was also super oily.  This probably works better for those that only get a few bites a summer, but if you get them often like me, I'd stick with deet products over this.  Also, for some reason mine was not shipped with the spray nozzle so it was SUPER messy.  Overall the product seems to have other uses so hopefully it will be good for those.",1
1,"While the bottles that I received looked the genuine, the contents certainly were not. It appears that the original aftershaves/cologne were swapped out with water since the liquid only had a very faint smell of the original contents and the liquid was clear. Hoping there was a mistake but I am thinking not.    Just to be very clear, I vigorously shook the bottles before trying the scents.",1
2,I have been buying whitening gel for over 10 years and the packaging on this gel is absurdly complicated and wasteful of product.  The gel is OK but I have gotten better gels from other supplies at better pricing.,1

1,"Very hard, killed my ankle in couple of hours. Not recommended, especially for the price.",1
1,"Your all fooling your self if you think these appliances work...Grinding is really never a problem, its the clenching at nite thats the serious issue. Grinding is only a para-functional modality that we all have to one degree or another. These fabricated toys can never duplicate the joint balance that is physically required. A slight imperfection can cause serious problems in the joint balance. Besides, the grinding never stops, your back teeth are still hitting, this time on the added material you've stuffed in your mouth. Clenching on the back teeth is the issue. This is the issue, the back teeth must be in a position where they don't touch while sleeping....be smart...see your dentist",1
2,This item is cheap. I got one of these for myself and tried to find a one that was a little different. Way too big to fit cc for a wallet,1
2,Not great for African American hair... worked great on my (white) boyfriend's hair.,1
1.0,Old smell have not use for outing don't have a fresh smell,1
2,Mirror returned-  it was akward on my neck and did not stay in place when I moved my arms to style the back of my hair.,1
2,"The perfume has a nice floral scent. I had received it in a large sampler selection and I was pretty excited about this one. The smell, however, wears off almost completely in an hour or so. It was something of a disappointment. The rating of the perfume isn't for its smell, but because it can't stay on long enough!",1
1.0,"I have used the Burt's Bees Natural Acne Solutions before and love the product. It does a great job of what it is created to do. However, my problem is with the seller - Blue Lagoon Beauty. When I have bought previous tubes of this product from a retail outlet like CVS, the bottom of the tube where it is crimped shut, there is an expiration date stamped in this crimping. The tube I received from Blue Lagoon Beauty, it did not come in a box as a new product should and the expiration date was cut off. This suggests that Blue Lagoon Beauty is selling expired product and removing the expiration date so you don't know how old the product is that you receive from them. I would not buy from them in the future.",1
1,Had gotten a new tattoo and this did absolutely nothing! Did not dull the pain or anything else! Total rip off for sure!,1
2,I love the product but I received a mess in a box! The bottles cap was loose and so the product leaked everywhere. It was less than half full when I got it,1
2,"Not asking for too much out of a toothbrush head, but unfortunately one of the toothbrushes stopped working (wouldn't vibrate) after less than one week.",1
1,I'm only given this product one star b/c the product was not the same color as I previously purchased. It's normally a brown reddish color but the ones I received are orangy yellowish color. I feel it's more of the seller fault for shipping not the product itself. Overall I luv this product.,1
2,"This product was listed as NEW, but it seems that it isn't. The bottle smelled strongly of nail polish as soon as I opened the box, meaning it was probably opened before hand, and there was dried up polish along the rim of the bottle....",1
2,"This was placed in a bundle package. It appears that there are 100 strips (as pictured). However, I received big strips that need to be cut or have to purchase another tool for cutting them. They work ok and I have cut them with a scissors, but was a little upset that the picture/description was not accurate",1
1,"If you like the feel of paste on you face and a dry sensation all day or night, then this is the cream for you.  There doesn't appear to be any moisturizing agent whatsoever in this.  Simply amazing that a company like Amazon would have such a product link. Don't waste your time nor your money on this one.",1
2,"This gun is kind of messed up. We can't seem to get it adjusted correctly! No matter how we try it just won't work correctly, and it also gets hot too fast.",1
1,A very cheap product that doesn't work. Flimsy..poorly made and a total waste of money. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.,1
1,this is the one of the worst palettes I have ever used.  the color barely shows up and doesn't last.,1
1,"I got the burning red skin too. I read the ingredients after applying.. Genius.. Red dye, fragrance and 20% unnatural burning ingredients! Packaging says 80% natural ingredients..should have left it at that. Do not recommend.",1
1,"This stuff broke my skin out! after about three days it began to peel my skin. I had to stop using it and go back to my other way of clearing my acne, don not buy this stuff>",1
2,"okay, i have never been a fan of Garneir Fructis but i did like this product... the first few times i used it. This actually dries out your hair really bad and causes dry, breaking ends after a few weeks of use. It smells amazing though, i can give it that. It has good stuff in it, but it also has bad stuff in it (like alcohol). I do not recommend this product.",1
1,"This is awful lipstick. I used lip primer and lip liner and it steal was terrible. Halloween lipstick is better than this. I always thought NYX was one of the better cheap brands, too. ;_;",1
1,"Very small, not as big as you think and feels cheap mirror chips",1
1,"I chose two Bay Rum Aftershaves: &#34;Captain's Choice&#34; & &#34;Barberry Coast&#34;.  After using each one, I can honestly say that I smelled like a medicine cabinet after wearing Captain's Choice.  Checking Amazon.com's return policy on this product had revealed the following:<br />&#34;Captain's Choice&#34; could NOT be returned, but Barberry Coast COULD.  According to AMAZON.COM'S own policy,  Captain's Choice is considered a Hazardous Waste.",1
1,This product gets one star only because the color was correct but it wasn't 100% human hair -- there were several pieces of some type of wire mixed in the bulk hair...and I didn't know it at the time but bulk hair is really hard to use for natural hair twist styles.,1
1,"What a terrible disappointment!  I have happily used this product for over a dozen years.  I love the smell (coconut, smells like summer!) and the way it went on. Imagine my totally shock and disappointment to find that it has been totally changed. This was not disclosed before purchase - there is no way to know that it has been redone.  It is now very gloppy and sticky - quite thick, hard to rub in.  It has a plastic feel. To add insult to injury the smell is different.  If you are a long time user be warned! it is not the same product.",1
2,Ok product like oil of olay better.,1
2,"I got this conditioner months ago after watching a youtube video in which a young lady went on and one about how beautiful her hair always looked after using this treatment. To say the least I have used it several times and it is a pure waste of money. My hair wasn't manageable, moisturized or anything. Since it's such a large container I will probably combine it with some other conditioner and use it, but I would not recommend it.",1
1,I had a similar experience as another reviewer - broke out itching all over my face and neck; nose itched all day - all of this after I washed the product off just an hour after application!!,1
1,"Scarcely pigmented cones on the end of a handle. I tried everything I knew of to make the color darker, there just wasn't much pigment in the product. Real cheap.<br /><br />This was true for all 3 of the Kohl sticks. I just threw them out. They weren't even worth keeping as outer eyeliner.",1
1,Not at all what I was expecting.  Kind of an old lady smell not fresh and flowery. Too powdery for me.,1
2,I did not like this item because it did not shave well.  It pulled and did not cut regardless of what razor blade that I used.,1
2,"I decided to try a few Kiss My Face products through amazon.com's Subscribe & Save program, and although I was satisfied with their shampoo and conditioner, I was very disappointed with this particular product.  I am kind of sensitive to certain odors and scents, but usually find that body lotion scents tend to be fairly mild and I very rarely have issues with them.  This was not the case with the Honey & Calendula scent; I found it offensive from the first time I tried it - it's not a particularly strong or sharp scent (not bad enough to give me a headache), but I found it almost sickeningly sweet.  I was really disappointed, since I had purchased the largest size - 32 oz., and didn't want to have to toss it. I tried several more times to use it, and found that I was unable to do so; I actually had to shower it off to rid myself of the smell the next couple of times I put it on.  In addition, I found that the odor attracted insects! I live in Hawaii, and every time I had the lotion on and stepped out of the house, I was surrounded by tiny flying insects that seemed fascinated by something in the ingredient list.  I found this very upsetting!<br /><br />At one point, I even mixed the lotion with unscented Lubriderm (in the hopes of at least minimizing the smell enough to wear it), but still found it unbearable.  I realize that scent and odor can be a very personal issue to people, but at the same time, felt that there was something really \\""not just right\\"" about this particular scent.  I ended up giving the product away to a friend.",1
1,Does not work!! Might be natural but doesn't work very well.,1
2,"First off I try to use mainly organic skincare products but unfortunately this sunscreen did nothing for my complexion. I have porcelain skin that is really sensitive and prone to breakouts yet is also dry and this sunscreen caused numerous zits.  A few things you may like to know: the product has a sunscreeny smell, slightly grape like too- a scent I didn't particularly like. Also, the sunscreen provides enough moisture that you don't need any added lotion- which is a plus. The ingrediants are pretty virtuous which is hard to find in a sunscreen- another plus. Before purchasing, I read reviews for the product on sephora and numerous people raved about it so if you have relatively normal healthy and happy skin I'd say give it a try but if you have sensitive or acne prone skin I would skip it.",1
1,WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!! THIS IS A TINY BLOCK PALLETE AND THE COLORS ARE TINY SO NOT WORTH THE MONEY GUYS I AM NOT HAPPY AT ALLTHATS WHY THEY DONT PUT THE SIZE OF  THIS TINY ITTY BITTY THING SOOO NOT HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE SO NOT WORTH THE PRICE  NOT  WORTH  THE  MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
2,"It's ok. When I started using it, my face broke out. I thought because it's a new product I'm adding to my regimen, that it was going to happen. However, after continuous use, I noticed that my breakouts weren't clearing up and they got worse. I used the same face wash as before. Nothing else changed, but this. I even tried using all the settings but still the same results.",1
1,"I've gone through the gamut of electric razors - Braun, Panasonic, Norelco, etc. I have had several Braun razors through the years, and decided to give this one a go. It worked great for the first few months. Then, the issues began. In a nutshell, the cleaning mechanism did not work. The razor wouldn't seat correctly, and the cleaning either wouldn't start or it stopped mid-cycle. I called Braun customer service, and got a major run around. I mailed it in to an authorized repair shop to determine the issues and get them fixed. They mailed it back, stating it was repaired and that there were issues with the connectors. It worked fine for about 2 weeks, and the same issues happened over and over again. Essentially, razor doesn't register when inserted into the cleaning chamber. It won't run a complete cleaning cycle. I searched around to buy a replacement charging/cleaning stand - and they're sold out or back-ordered everywhere. Which leads me to believe this is a known issue with this razor, and everyone is trying to replace the charging stands. Sad to say, I had this razor too long for a return to Amazon, and of course, the cleaning cartridges can't be returned at any point. For its price point, I expected so much more. I wouldn't recommend this one. I'm sticking with Panasonic.",1
1,"This headband is tiny and does not fit my head. Also, the hearts look cheap, like they were spray painted on. Very disappointed.",1
2,everything seemed fine..nicely bottled and wrapped..but when used on my face it made my roseacea much worse..my skin instantly turned red and broke out..,1
1,"I bought this hair dryer because I needed a new one. My old one got permanently lost when I moved. I was really dissappointed when I took a shower before work one morning and went to use my new hair dryer because when I plugged it in, it didn't work. I tried clicking the reset button, but it wouldn't reset (ie it wouldnt &#34;click&#34;). Luckily, Amazon is pretty great. I went into my account and asked for a replacement hairdryer. They sent me a new one (which I received a day or two later). I went to use that one and it didn't work either (again - just to make sure I wasn't losing my mind, I tried multiple outlets and resetting the product). I'm not sure if there is a bad batch of these or what... but both of the hair dryers I bought did not work. Now I'm waiting for a Conair one to arrive.",1
2,"gel was too thick or too dilute; very difficult to work with. I was quite disappointed, as the OPI products I had worked with before were OK, so I don't know if something was wrong with these packages specifically or not.",1
2,"I received the Gillette Body Razor free from Gillette to review. From first stroke, I realized this may not be the razor for me.

1,"If Einstein found the perfect formula; I doubt he would have changed it. I ordered this and immediately returned it upon opening it. I squirted some onto my hand and noticed how different it was from the twelve ounce bottle I'm currently finishing. The older formula was more natural and contained pure oils where as this newer formula seems to contain extracts and synthetics emulsified with different coconut oils. The newer formula also does not seem to contain any of the algae(at least it isn't listed on the ingredients list) or the \\""colloidal oatmeal\\"", nor the hyaluronic acid. The older version was by far my all time favorite natural lotion. The newer version of the Olivina body lotion is not as smooth. It is also not as rich as the older formula despite containing dimethicone which is basically a form of silicone used to smooth skin and retain moisture barrier. Silicone isn't that harmful except it inhibits skins ability to breathe. Silicone used in hair products suffocates hair follicles as well. If this is the new formula Olivina is using then I will sadly never purchase Olivina products again.",1
2,These aren't very big and don't work as good as other brands I've tried. kind of disappointed with the product,1

I had cheeto orange patches, banana colored streaks, almost white spots and patches of my roots that were completely unaffected. A stylist was able to fix it before I had to be at work on Monday.

Then came the part I really hated.....the lingering medicinal and fake sweetness that I just couldn't get rid of.

1,"This review covers: Ion Permanent (8NN) Ammonia- Free hair Color Ion Ammonia-Free 32v developer  No Ash tones available above a level 6 :( it's practically impossible not to pull warms tones (think red, copper, orange) if your goal is to achieve anything lighter than a level 6. This ammonia-free ion developer formula is gentle. I did not have the burning, itching or irritation as I get with salon color. Make sure you DO the test strand to be certain that you are not allergic to this product before covering your entire head with it, please.  UpDate: DAYS LATER I HAD AN ALLERGIC SKIN REACTION- WHEN I READ THE INGREDIENTS I FOUND MULTIPLE PPDs, RESORCINOL AND OTHER ALLERGENIC IRRITANTS IN IT.   I am naturally a level 4/5 ashy brown and was trying to level up to a 7/8 neutral. Haha. I was coloring virgin hair. Using Ion ammonia-free permanent 8NN with the 32 volume developer brought out lighter, brassy color that I wasn't looking for. The color wasn't what I was expecting.  You will NEED TO TONE afterwards.  I had the color on for 45 minutes at a 1:1. I had some face-framing breakage, so maybe you shouldn't leave the product on for the full 45 minutes. Instructions read 30-45 mins for my application. So, if you plan to level up 3-4 shades (do not use this ammonia- free line), you may get coppery & may need to tone with a demi.  It did not cover much grey, either. (I'm about 20%)  I've also used this brands 18 v developer & it didn't even lift one shade, perhaps it's only for depositing color.  A week after the color, I applied the Ion Demi Clear Color w/ 10 volume Sensitive Scalp (contains parabens) This  product didn't do anything at all.  If you have a Sally's Beauty Supply nearby, you can pick up this product and not have to pay s&h.  This lines N or NN or NA pulls copper/orange/red in my hair.  I ordered Paul Mitchell colors & they contain ammonia & resorcinols, multiple PPDs- completely unsafe.   Pravana, Schwarzkopf Essensity, Framesi, Naturotint & Goldwell all have these dangerous chemicals in their formulas as well. I have found most salon brands fall in the Paul Mitchell ingredient category.   UPDATE: I do not use Ion anymore, even without parabens, there are still dangerous allergenic ingredients in this product. At least two ingredients score an 8 on EWGs database.ll HAVE to tone it, also.  I will report back & let you know what I end up with.     I tried to figure it out myself b/c I can't sit for all the color work that my stylist used to do- it took too long.  I can do it at home in stages & save a ton of money. Watching youtube videos galore.",1

1,"After researching different cleanses I decided to try this one out. Before getting pregnant, I would do a cleanse at least 1-2 times a year and I would stick to the same brand but for some reason, I thought it would be good to try something different. Of course, it helped when I found the 2 pack at the local drug store as a BOGO deal. First of all, no where does it say if you should take them together or if you should do them separately but after reading a couple reviews from this website and another I was under the impression that you were supposed to take them together. Day one - I did exactly as the box said and took the pills in the morning before breakfast but then about 2 hours later I was feeling very sick. I figured it was my body adjusting to doing a cleanse again. I managed to last 3 days on this cleanse but after 2 nights of not sleeping at all and the third night of being up all night from severe stomach pains I decided to call it quits. The day after I stopped taking the cleanse my body is back to normal and I don't have any stomach pains at all. I am thankful that I was able to take this product back and get a full refund.

1,"DID NOT CARE FOR THE SMELL .AND WOULD NOT  ORDER AGAIN,ITS HARD TO ORDER  ANY FRAGRANCES WITH OUT SMELLING IT FIRST [MAYBE THEY SHOULD PUT OUT SAMPLES] YOU MIGHT SELL ALOT MORE OR NOT....AND SHIPPING WAS MORE THEN THE FRAGRANCE OIL.",1
2,"It was great in the beginning. However, after only 4 uses the tongue no longer moves. I thought it was the batteries but the bullet part works, so it's the motor to the tongue. Thoroughly disappointed.",1
1,This stuff DOES NOT WORK....Period.,1
1,This hair chalk on blond hair when you try to wash it out turns your  hair a nasty murky color that is hard to get out.,1
2,Old formula. Didn't feel or smell like the new stuff. Didn't leave my scalp feeling tingly like the new stuff,1
1,ordered new bottle 1 oz n when received bottle  pump didnt work  so unscewed cap n bottle hardly had any serum in it.  never again will order anything here.,1
2,"Bought this brush for my wife who is a zebra freak. The brush arrived with another from the same company and I was not really impressed. Granted the price is low and the look of it was decent I suppose but the pin bristle things fall out very easy. Actually when it arrived it already was missing about five of them. Also the packaging of the brush was very sloppy, it looked like it was thrown in a box that just had a herd of elephants trample on it and there was only one small piece of bubble wrap inside that was just kind of free floating. If you have thick hair I do not reccomend this brush because the bristles will probably fall out in about a month.",1
1,"I was excited about this natural product, even my sister had tried it and it worked great for her.  I gave it several weeks and each day it made me smell rancid, awful. Was really disappointed!  Was excited to finally find a natural deodorant with great reviews and success!  Just wasn't meant for me I guess!",1
1,"Streaky, matte and thw colors were wasy off. China glaze is a good brand but the quality was just plain horrible.",1
1,"After using the matching shampoo and this conditioner, my hair was dry like a haystack.<br />I used a handful of this conditioner and it still didn't soften my hair.<br />As for shiny - I couldn't tell- I was too busy noticing how much my hair color had faded after only one use of this product. Awful.",1
2,Broke right away! I started using it on my wigs when they were untangled and it broke instantly. It cannot handle a wig.,1
1.0,"This was a traumatic experience lasting weeks in trying to get a resolution. Upon receipt of the product, the invoice identified the correct mascara but the wrong mascara was shipped. Then the ordeal began to try and get it returned and credited. Many emails exchanged with shipper. Then Cellular Factory wanted a picture of the product so I sent that about 3 times. Then more emails from them. Long story short: I've still got the product and AMAZON made the refund. Thank you Amazon but no thanks Cellular Factory. I failed to mention that I finally had to go to my local Dillard's and purchase the mascara at a higher price.",1
2,"there were 2 good things about the wig, it was long & thick other than that, the wig was a bust.<br />it looked very wiggy & shiny and the invisible lace part looked super fake as well. i would never wear this out in public. maybe it would have been better if i could have pulled some of my own hair out on front but i couldn't because im natural so it wouldn't have worked.<br />i wouldn't waste your money on this one ladies.",1
1,"I'm giving this product a 1 star because I can't give it a no star only because:<br />1. It stung my eyes - I put the serum at the base of my eyelashes as instructed. I stung my eyes. I put it on the lid so that it doesn't sting my eyes. It still stung my eyes.<br />2. Since I barely used the product for all of 3 nights, there was no results to mention.<br />3. The seller/company was really nice when I contacted them about the issue and they reimburse me for the product.",1
1,Not what i expected.  The color is nude watered down...DO NOT ORDER...VERY DISAPPOINTED..,1
2,These gel toe crest cause me more pain and I do not like how they feel in my shoe.  I could not keep them on for even 15 minutes.,1
1,These are not Mink!,1
2,This product drys my lips.,1
1,"The lightest shade is NOT good for fair skin, it doens't match me hardly at all. I returned it.",1
2,"This product received good reviews, so that's why I tried it.  When I first applied it, I could feel it tightening my skin; and yes, the wrinkles were gone.  However, the reasons that I gave it so few stars are: it did very little for the puffiness under my eyes; it didn't last-within a few hours, the wrinkles were back; it was dry and had a tint to it that that stood out like a sore thumb on my face; and lastly, when I applied moisturizer or makeup (I dabbed it on so that I wouldn't distrub the tightened areas), the tightening effect was immediately lost.",1
1,"I was just given this set- new- and was impressed by the reviews. I'm not sure if it's just my hair, but these do little more than a roller hair brush and dryer. I figured I needed to work out the kinks and give it another try. Again same look and that's all the curl I have after 20 minutes. Concept is good- just doesn't work on my fine, full head of hair. If you want curl stick to the hot rollers.",1
1,"My nails are very thin and weak, and I have a horrible problem with peeling in particular.  Through doing some online research, I read many recommendations to use a crystal nail file, which is supposedly more gentle and does not cause nails to peel.  Although it was difficult for me to shell out close to ten dollars for this product, I figured that if it solved my peeling problem, it would be worth it, and so I purchased this Revlon crystal file in my local grocery store.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the file was a huge disappointment.  At first, it seemed adequate, although nothing miraculous.  However, I never had the opportunity to determine whether this file would actually help my nails stop peeling, as after just a few uses (I would say less than five), the surface of the file became so worn down that it was totally ineffective.  I followed the packaging instructions to \\""rinse and reuse,\\"" but rinsing did absolutely nothing to restore the surface grip.  Therefore, after owning this file for only a few weeks, I found it to be totally unusable.  (As a side note, I did contact Revlon to complain; rather than to refund my money, they gave me a 5-dollar off coupon towards another purchase).<br /><br />So in conclusion, I can find no redeeming qualities about this product whatsoever, and I cannot recommend it.",1
2,"It was an okay wig, worked what I needed it for, but it shed a TON. I expect a little shedding with wigs, but i had a few clumps come out when I was trying to style it. Really shiny, I suggest dulling it if you use it for cosplay. Much shorter than it looks, as well.",1
1,"This brush worked great at first but while using with the hairdryer, the bristles melted into my hair. Quite a mess, luckily did not damage my hair.",1
2,"The Bluebeard's Original Beard Saver is little more than a creamy leave-in conditioner. It did little to tame my out-of-control goatee. I have had better luck with other (far less expensive) options. I was not overly impressed with the results, and will not buy this again.<br /><br />The smell is decent, but for the price it should smell (and work) much better.",1
1,"Easily bogged down, burns up batteries and motor died after 3 months. Don't waste your money on this junk, not worth it.",1
1,"Product totally disappointed , nothing to do with the displayed image, it seems that only took the hair of an old person and cut him well wrapped and sent it, has gray hair and several colors , smooth and even did not come in a package remy sealed as it should be , it only certifies that do not sell original products quality as those promoted on the site, definitely not return them to buy more",1
2,"Smells great, feels great... but a week later I experienced the worst breakout I have had in years, this wasnt just &#34;purging.&#34; I returned this item and will not buy again.",1
2,it hurts tooooooo much！,1
1.0,Not at all as expected.  Would not purchase again.,1
2,Tip is too pointy.  I can't actually grab anything with it.,1
1,"This product had no seal!!!! How Unhygienic, selling used lipstick!!!! What a waste of money, I had to throw it away. God only knows who used this product!!! GROSS!!!!",1
1.0,Smells gross! Smells like bug spray! I have been in the hunt for a good natural deodorant. I've always used Toms but thought I'd give this one a try. If you don't mind smelling like bug spray then you might like this but I personally think it's nasty. Wasn't to fond of having to rub it on with my hands either. Disappointed :(,1
1,"I've never heard a louder shaver.  I used it twice, and the second time I wore earplugs because the first time was actually painful.<br /><br />When I cleaned it up, the blades popped off if I even touched them.  The plastic material in the blade and in the mounting post looked to me to be the same quality as plastic toys at a school carnival.<br /><br />I decided to return it because of the loudness.  I still have most of my hearing and I'd like to keep it as long as possible!",1
2,"The mirror quality is good and the packing was OK but the product was broken electrically.  If it had ever been tested with batteries, it would not have lit.  Zadro makes a quality product but there was no &#34;inspected by&#34; or &#34;OK&#34; or any indication that the product had been inspected.",1
1.0,too expensive go to sams or costco and get 50 razors for cost of one. very costly,1
1,"cute little box very pricey  I thought they were straight essentials  but they are mixed with bath oil  ..so don't last very long<br /><br />smells were awesome<br />BIGGEST LETDOWN ,,,ONE BOTTLE RECEIVED WAS OVER HALF EMPTY!!!( And it was not spilled anywhere in the packaging I contacted the company and got no response !!!!!<br />the packaging was not sealed when I  received it  Was probably a return  :((((",1
1,"HonTect Itch stopper<br />This product was useless - and to add insult to injury, they refused to take it back. What a total ripoff!",1
2,I bought this for my friend. She was greatly disappointed. The different settings on the light ( which is not very bright) is actually a piece of plastic that slides over the bulb to change the hue.  I would not suggest buying this. I will be buying a better one as soon as possible. You get what you pay for.,1
2,It said it will moisturize your skin but it left my skin dry.if you have a combination skin then I wouldn't recommend it.it gives u an artificial glow.it might be good to lighten up skin complexion but don't wear it during day!,1
2,I was expecting a larger clip and this ad seems to make that claim - without actually stating it! Would not recommend it for long or thick hair.,1
1,"To me, it smells awful, and leaves my hair crispy. If my hair gets wet from humidity while this in in my hair it gets all weird and crispy, making it look even thinner than it otherwise would. Also dries it out to an extreme. Don't buy.",1
1,I've used this product before and it works great. The one I received was packaged poorly resulting in the lid breaking at some point. When I opened it the developer was all over the inside of the box and there was mud smeared across the bottle. Spend a few extra dollars and buy from somewhere else.,1
2,"Bought it for my sister. She says that bottles of nail polish will not fit in it, even though it clearly states in the title that it was made for lipstick AND nail polish.",1
2,Too runny.,1
2,"I decided to try this product as friends advised that I should develop some sort of anti-aging regime as I approach the big 40. Previously, my routine was soap and water. Saw these products at a mall kiosk and decided to try them.<br /><br />Can't say that in the 8 months I've been using the anti-aging serum, I've seen any noticeable difference in the ever so tiny wrinkles that have started to develop. However, since the stuff costs a bundle, I will continue to use it until it finishes.",1
2,"This shampoo sounded so promising- fresh pineapple sounds divine.  Sadly, the scent is not a real fresh, juicy pineapple, it's much more of a pineapple vanilla.  It kind of smells like dessert.  I realize that lots of people will love that, but it's not my thing.  I wanted a fresher, fruitier scent.",1
1,Quality sucks! Very disappointed with product because it does not straighten my hair and this hair straightener feels and looks cheap,1
1,"Ugh, I wanted to love these.<br />They are TINY, cheaply made, and just not worth the money. The bell bow collar that came with the ears looks ridiculous and is just as cheap looking.",1
1,"I purchased this item thinking it was a box of mints containing little individual boxes, but it wasn't the case. You get one small package containing one lonely box of smints.<br />I requested a form to return this to the seller, I will update my review with more information. Hoping to be able to return this, but we will see.",1
2.0,"Very misleading ! I &#34;thought&#34; I was buying 4 vials of the Santal Carmin, instead it was actually 2 Santal Carmin & 2 Orange. Other then that , I love the Santal Carmin but would not have made this purchase had I known it was 2 and 2. So 5 stars for the cologne , but 2 Stars for the Seller.",1
2.0,Very pretty scarf. In the picture it looked to me like a thick winter scarf but is more like a thin silky scarf. Lovely product just not what I thought it wad,1
2,i thought purchasing this product was goin to work well on my 10 months olds dry skin....it didnt work! i was really disappointed..it absorbs easily onto the skin..not oily or heavy. He didnt breakout or anything which was fine. personally i think it will work great on other babies who do not suffer from dry skin.,1
1,it was sticky and do not look natural. I was disappointed. I thought it would go on smooth. I prefer using a brown eyeshadow.,1
1,I was under the impression that the bottles came with the case.  I was disappointed and highly upset.  Don't buy.,1
1,"When ordering Christmas presents in November, 2012, I ordered this Lily of the Valley by Yardley as a early Christmas gift for mmyself.  I really looked forward to receiving my \\""treat\\"" because I hadn't had any for some time.  So very disappointed upon receiving.  Another reviewer stated that her's didn't last the day.  Mind barely spells as I'm putting it on.  Won't be buying this again.",1
1.0,"Was not what I expected, all the bottles were samples. I suggest buying directly through isagenix",1
1,"I purchased this from Target in 2014 and the product was 20% zinc oxide and worked wonderfully! When I saw it at Costco in a 2-pack, I happily bought it for the summer of 2015. I was sorely disappointed as this Honest sunscreen is NOT the same formula as the original tube I bought. The ingredients are different (only 9.3% zinc oxide) and it is extremely greasy and DOES NOT WORK. The original tube is blue (like the picture on this product listing) but the ones from Costco are light blue/white with sunbeams on the front. I will be returning these tubes to Costco and hopefully they will refund my money. Very disappointed seeing as though not only did I use this on my own fair skin, I used it on my 6 year old, 3 year old and 9 month old. Thank goodness I discovered that it didn't work before we went to the water park all day tomorrow!!",1
2,"The shaver was far too light to allow a comfortable experience.  I found my fingers slipping on the ribbed-plastic neck too many times.  At times the blade would flex too much in one direction, even with slow, smooth draws.  I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.",1
1,"I've been using VO5 shampoo since I was a kid, and I've never seen this stuff sold for over a buck in any store. When I first wrote this review, I assigned 1 star because the pricing was FIVE TIMES higher than that. After awhile, I saw that they dropped the price to something more reasonable, and I gave it 5 stars. However, I didn't know if they'd try bumping it up again, so I left the title, and this note: \\""And if I come back here and see that it's at some outrageous price again, I WILL revert it to one star, and it will stay that way. Forever.\\""<br /><br />Well, now they're back up to their old tricks again. Since they asked for a permanent one-star review, they will now receive a permanent one-star review. The justification is simple: part of a product's value is the ratio of benefit provided to money spent. Since the ratio is comically poor compared to going to a grocery store, the value delivered is one star; you can shampoo your hair for a year on what these people want for a couple months.<br /><br />The shampoo itself is good. It won't make you smell like a perfume counter and it does what it's supposed to. Moreover... no one needs to be paying more than a buck for a bottle of shampoo. It isn't made out of gold. DON'T reward these people for trying to price gouge you, or they will just keep doing it.",1
1,"I was disappointed with this clip.  It is much smaller than I expected, and is not even the same color as what is shown.  I will be returning this.",1
1,This product wasnt good at all. Doesnt look like anything in the picture. It's really thin and fake. You need to buy 3 or 4 for to actually look like some type of extension. It does not even reach around your head to look like full extensions makes you look like you have a mullet. I do not recommend this product at all!,1
2.0,"Too perfume-y and powdery.  Smells like something an old granny would wear.  Love you granny but don't want to smell powdery!  Kind of a White Shoulders undertone.  McQueen clothes are sexy, dark and provocative...I was hoping this would be naughty and fun.  Too bad!<br /><br />For reference my favorite perfumes are anything by Donna Karan and Armani.  I have a hard time with the Chanel line because the synthetic white musk smells like bug spray to me.  I like Roses to Chloe but dislike Tea Rose.",1
1.0,"For those who are newly purchasing the Shu Uemura eyelash curler, this is not the real one. As soon as I opened the package, something felt off, the strange printing on the box to the terrible quality of the eyelash curler. It's fine to sell eyelash curlers, but selling under the brand name Shu Uemura is very misleading and unethically.",1
1,It worked great for couple weeks until extending it the handle came off,1
2,So I would love this shampoo if it was thicker!! I will poor some in my hand and it is impossible to get onto my scalp without it all dripping! You literally have to poor the shampoo from the bottle onto your scalp :/ I would prefer it to be thicker.,1
2,Love these products but picture is of the 12oz jar of shampoo but written description is of 88ml (3ozs) BIG difference. Sorry I bough  these  as a set would have done better individually,1
1,when I opend the bag.... the eyeshadows were all over the place everything was a big blob and a big mess ....,1
1,"All authentic Skinceuticals products come with a number printed on the bottom of the bottle that matches the one on the bottom of the box. No number and box was torn at the seal when I opened the package. I have ordered this serum many times from reputable, authorized Skinceuticals dealers and this bottle was clearly diluted. Buyer beware of this vendor!",1
1,This is the total fake!  Lotion bottle is not even the same design as the original.  Doesn't even smell like your original and you'll be wasting your money.,1
2,"These are not high end polishes. However, they dry fast (which is good considering you usually need 3-4 coats for good coverage).",1
1,"I wanted to try this deodorant because I liked the all natural aspect. Well, I took a shower and I used the Jason Lavender Deod. It did not work at all. Boy, was I stinky! It was only about four hours and I was doing nothing in an air conditioned house. I could only imagine if I was in the heat or working at my job. I'm VERY disappointed. If I could give it half a star I would. I'll go back to Secret I guess. Sigh.",1
2,"Seriously, how can you make a dry calendula product? It totally beats the purpose of it. This soap just dries up, I could not believe it myself. Calendula is supposed to be great for eczema and dry skin but with that soap, it gets worse. Not enough calendula and too much chemicals, I'm sure. Way too expensive for what it is.",1
1,"I thought this would be better than my tried-and-true Revlon tool for removing skin bumps, but it does not work.  Except, maybe, as a lemon zester?  I think I'll sterilize it and put it in my kitchen drawer.  Also, Tweezerman's guarantee is not customer friendly.",1
1,"1) it is oily and shiny and  cheap looking  , it is cheap oil .  2) needs to be shake before use , this is cheap stuff  3) container is contaminateable  4) you will be sorry buying it   Saeed",1
1,This was shipped inside a large box with a TV. The makeup was free to roll around. It was crushed. I contacted the company and they have yet to contact me back. Very frustrating.,1
2,Very dry.,1
2,First time out of the box I found it lacks cutting power and it takes many times to get a decent shave. One is better off to by a trimmer and have someone do it for them.,1
2,"Although it does fit the Cruzer razor, the photo is NOT of the one that is shipped.  The foil shipped is for maintaining a three-day growth appearance and not a clean shave.",1
1,"Wand worked for 6 months then died. Never dropped or handled roughly, don't waste your money.",1
1,Good,1
1.0,"Hair felt dry, perfume smell too strong, would not recommend.",1
2,"It is a sunscreen, not a BB cream.",1
2.0,"Didn't work for me. I tried using it with my hair damp as they suggested. I tried with my hair wet and also dry. Then I did the same methods, but with more product.  Nothing. Before I knew it, it was past the date to return it.<br />Make sure to have a magnifying glass to read the back label, if you buy it. This is the smallest print I have ever seen on any product.<br />Nice artwork on tube. Says the word SEXY twice on the front of the tube. I guess the company is a believer in the term: &#34;sex sells&#34;. Sure does smell nice though, just wished it worked.",1
2,"I didnt like this because it is too expensive, it contains wheat and too much is needed to thicken sauces.",1
1.0,Too small for an adult.Beautiful clip for a toddler.,1
2,"This item was not what I expected.  Looking at the photos and reading the information was deceiving,  I wasn't able to use this for the purpose intended.  Wasn't able to return it, so I",1
2,"I bought this before on Amazon. I had no sensitivity to the product however, this time the gel burns my gums.",1
2,Not as wet when first used. Nice size. They are $30 at MAC stores. Nice re-closable case. Smells great!,1
1.0,Terrible product.  Clumpy and looks like a child applied it.  It dries with mascara like balls of stuff on eyebrow hairs!,1
1,"One of the bottles was missing half of its contents, so I could not use the product to color my hair.",1
1,it was a piece of crap,1

2,"I am a big L'oreal junky when it comes to their mascaras and eye liners to me no other brands can can compare to theirs anyway My local store was out of stock of the L'oreal Paris Voulminous  Mascara so I decided to buy this one. I was really disappointed, it clumped from the moment I tried it on. And it was dry the next day it was basically empty I did check if it was closed tightly and it was. I will not be buying this product again or the gold tube mascara. I gave it an extra star just because their other mascras dont seem to dissapoint.",1
1,Loud obnoxious sound.  It worked for all of 15 minutes.  This items is junk.,1
2,I don't like the fact that this doesn't have any heat settings. You are not able to sit the iron on top of a table or else it will melt it. Sorry I'm just a regular gal who doesn't have any neat cubby holes to stash my hot iron in. Also my hair can take some heat since it's super thick and coarse so I don't think this iron is meant for thick/coarse hair. Luckily this was a gift and I didn't have to pay for it.,1
1,"Its a good concept but unfortunately doesn't work, its great as a bar of soap but a night mare for someone with long hair.",1

1,i dont think it works,1
1,"Beware before buying this.  My husband ordered this for me through Amazon Prime for Valentine's because he was out of town.  First of all, it won't be delivered in 2 days which it does state, but if you're used to ordering things through Prime sometimes you miss the green warning of \\""extra processing\\"".  Second, it arrived in a box from \\""Amazon Returns\\"" center which I thought was a red flag.  Third, it smelled funny and I only say this because I only use Clinique perfume and I know what it should smell like.  I have never had a problem and thought maybe I was just imagining things because of the returns center labeling on the package. I did break out in a rash a few minutes later on my arms where I had applied it.  That has never happened to me with any perfume before.  Lastly, when I got on amazon to check what was going on with this I realized that in parentheses on the full website the date of Nov 2, 2005 was underneath it.  Packaging date perhaps?  It does not have this date on the mobile site.  In 5 years of being a loyal Amazon customer I have only written one other negative review for something that was falsely advertised through another vendor and sold through amazon.  However, I truly feel this product is not what people believe they are purchasing.  I'm pretty disappointed in both Amazon and Clinique which is who the product was sold by.  I'm not sure what is going on here but I've learned my lesson and will be fighting for a return and no longer purchasing perfume through amazon.",1
2.0,"Went on a soap spree, since i tried the blacksoap and the papaya from Nubian Heritage, i invested in the brand. I bought the hemp one and this one, but i don't really like either because they smell quite feminine. This one in particular really smells like a ladies' soap, and there is no trace of chai. Good brand though.",1
1,I bought this product thinking it would help reduce the lines and wrinkles around my mouth and it does nothing!  I even think it made them deeper and more noticeable. I would not buy this product again- worthless!,1

1.0,The oil for cuticles has a rancid smell maybe it was old. Had to wash my hands several times to rid the smell.,1
1,the fragance is really strong!! That's the only downside of buying on line you can't smell it first!!<br />Terrible scent!,1
1,"The product did not work properly upon receipt.  The motor appears to be frozen, and will only work sporadically if I shake the unit to free it up.  And after a few seconds of working, it will again freeze up.",1
2,They were just ok. They sting your eyes a bit and they are not as moist as other brands that are around the same price range.,1
2,"Okay I bought these for my lip piercings because they looked promising and came with a good amount well here's the problem first of all, this weren't even made of metal, they were like rubber and bendy, and they're also pretty small and I have a thick bottom lip and they look like a pretty good size in the picture but they're really small luckily they are bendy so it kinda helped but then after getting it into your lip, the ball is impossible to screw back on because it's so small and then I notice it doesn't even really screw on it anyways, it like pops on but not very securely because if you touch it, the ball comes off.",1
2,Got more lipsticks than I will ever use and they are horrible colors. I wanted more eye liners and eye shadows. I got this one and the 25 piece one and they both sucked.,1
1,Didn't even receive the correct item.... Received the shampoo instead of the conditioner . So frustrating and ver disappointing. Will not purchase any more products from amazon,1
1,My goodness. Did they really ask me for a review. This is the worst set of pencils I have ever bought. It smells like chemicals. I am even afraid to use it because of the strong chemical smell. Never seen a pencil smell like this. Said to myself that maybe it is one of those things shown on 20/20 in which people mix harsh chemicals to make makeup products for money. Please don't buy...,1

I've tried several brands, sometimes because they are on sale and generally I go back to Clairol's competitor because the other major brand is really pretty good.  I  actually took my normal brand out of my cart to try this one because foam sounded easy and I paid attention to the positive reviews instead of the negative ones.  This was a big mistake.<br /><br />My other brand includes 2 pairs of gloves this came with one set and a fraction of the amount of conditioner that L'Oreal has.  The foam is a gimmick because the only place you see foam is in the bottle and a small amount on your hands.  When you put the &#34;foam&#34; in  your hands onto your hair it just turns into glop.  The glop doesn't saturate the hair easily--its hard to spread, it spreads unevenly, and you have to be really careful or there will be a dripping mess.<br /><br />When I first put the concoction together it smelled extremely odd, like burned rubber that I was a bit worried my product had been tampered with.  The solution in the number 1 bottle was such a small amount as the other brand so  I was also worried it wouldn't cover my hair.  It was very difficult to spread through my hair and I was alarmed to see a the reddish brown turning clown hair orange while the color set.<br /><br />The conditioner was so oily my hair doesn't feel soft and conditioned it feels like it has an oil slick on it.  It took a lot of rinsing to get the oil out.  When I took the towel off my head I was alarmed to see how dark my hair looked.  I decided to blow it dry hoping it would lighten up.  In fact the root area is slightly lighter than the coal black color of my hair.  I didn't chose black I chose a light reddish brown because after long experience I know what color looks good.  I've never chosen black because even dark brown ages me.  I looked like I aged 10 years putting this horrible crap on my hair.<br /><br />Sometimes if you put some highlights on it can lighten up a too dark color.  If I buy highlights I'm not touching anything with the name Clairol on it.  The willingness to put out such an inferior product which wasn't really cheaper than my usual brand is a turn off to this company.  I'd colored my hair for a big meeting tomorrow and I now I look like crap, thanks Clairol for inviting me to go to a salon and see if they can salvage the mess you made of my hair.<br /><br />If you are over 50--pitch black hair is light a giant pointer to wrinkles.",1
1,"I bought these for a glow bowling party. I applied some to my face and it did not look any different in the light. Turned out the light and no glow. I thought maybe the foundation I was wearing was keeping it from working. Took a different crayon out and applied it in a swirl pattern all over my arm. Did not see in the light, did not work in the dark. Thought maybe this was more reactive. Went under the black lights to check it out at the glow bowling area still no sign of glow anything.",1
2,"Looks like plastic, too shiny, not realistic.",1
1,I bought this because I was traveling and couldn't bring my at home steamer. I plugged this &#34;Heat Cap&#34; in and it barely got warm!! The back of my head was totally omitted because there was NO heat coming from the base of the cap. This was a total waste of money. I bought the cordless Thermal Turban (microwaveable) and this works much better!!!!!,1
1,"Zero stars if I could!. The serum is housed in the equivalent of a mascara tube with a push pen delivery system to dispense the product onto a brush at the tip. The pusher is broken since the tube is completely sealed, the entire system is useless. It arrived broken like this in a shabby, tattered, and ripped box that looks nothing like the picture. The box pictured is blue and the box I received is brown. This company sends whatever crappy old stock they house on their shelves. My advice is to save your money for another retailer other than One Stop Shop Inc. because any type of cosmetic product is non-refundable.",1
1,"This product does not work well for thick hair, the crimp does not stay at all when you brush hair.  I returned the product and have not been refunded yet and every time I call they keep saying they don't have the package and the post office says that the company should all ready have the package (but the company keeps saying they don't have the package).  Do not do business with American RX!!!",1
2,"It was sticky.  I gave it to my daughter because I HATE sticky.  I love the light feel of lipglosses and since this sounded great, I tried it.  I put some on and thought instantly, \\""Oh crap!  It is sticky.  Oh well.\\""  A half hour later I kissed my husband goodbye and I felt it stick our lips together for a second!  What man likes that???  I will never get this again!  My other kind is awesome, but the brand wore off so I don't know what it is...I'll just keep looking!",1
1,"these were probably the worst buy ive ever made from amazon. although they were extremely cheap and they came before the date i was actually expecting them, they were waaaaaay too big for ANYONE'S teeth. also, the material of the trays made them really hard to mold to the teeth. i mean, the product came as described, it's just hard to tell the quality of the product from the picture. overall, the seller was amazing about shipping but the product SUCKS! you get what you pay for.",1
2,Arrived shattered. Was unable to use product.,1
2,"This product is something I would suggest for someone who has is just getting into styling their hair. It's sticky enough to give a decent hold, but not too much, and it isn't matte, but it isn't super shiny. It's good for someone trying to decide exactly how they want their hair to look, before purchasing better products.<br />No texture, but it does give a lot of separation. It's very sticky feeling if you touch it, and leaves hair with a slightly greasy shiny appearance. Holds pretty well, but not too much.<br />It's not something I'm going to continue to use, but it's not awful.",1
2,"Really really disliked the smell of this. Not sure if I had one that was off, but it didn't smell like tiare, it smelled like weird chemical perfume. I'm not accusing them of adding chemicals, but whatever process they use to extract the scent from the flowers just isn't working for me.<br /><br />I've been trying the high end Monoi I could find on Amazon, because I'm a big fan of Monoi, and this is IMO the worst. Again, I could have had a bad bottle, but I'm not willing to invest again to see if a new one smells different. I usually buy the other imported organic Monoi from Amazon, which is about $19/8oz, and it's heavenly. I've gotten three bottles now and it's been consistent every time. I wanted to try this brand to see if I was missing out on something even better, but no. Not a fan, unfortunately. I actually ended up puttin neroli essential oil into it to cover the smell and I use it as massage oil - the consistency is actually perfect for that.",1
1,Very blah. No real scent. Disappointed. I won't be buying this fragrance again. I don't think that I will be buying fragrances online again.,1
1.0,"Please read the many reviews posted, there seems to be a lot of customers that aren't happy with this product.  I used this product as directed for 3 weeks, 2x per day morning and night with absolutely no noticeable results, if anything it made my eyes look worse.  It seems to be a temporary fix, meaning it tightens up the eye area until you wash your face, then it's gone.  Be careful when ordering this gel because there seem to be a lot of people experiencing allergic reactions and receiving opened and used bottles.  Thank goodness there is a money back guarantee if unsatisfied and I have requested a return label. I will continue on in my search for the eternal &#34;fountain of youth.&#34;",1
2,"I really wanted this to be my facial savior, but, alas, you need a new one at least every year because the trimmer goes dull very quickly (I've tried 3!!). Not the foil, mind you, but the trimmer. Good luck trying to find a replacement blade! No place on the internet has it. How do I know? I've been searching for almost 3 years. This product needs to be more professional rather than a disposable shaver.",1
1,"I've already contacted Amazon to red flag Green Web Inc. When people buy this lotion, Green Web sends out a note in the package to write a review telling their &#34;success stories&#34; with this product and they will receive a free bottle of the Darksyde self tanner. I bought both of these products based on how great the reviews were, and now I know why they were so unusually positive. Don't waste your money on Darksyde products. This is an unproven company soliciting falsified reviews through Green Web (which, if you take a look at the products they sell, is not the most reputable or respectable company selling on Amazon). Please take your money elsewhere, and don't trust any reviews for Darksyde lotion sold by Green Web Inc.",1
2,Used twice and can was empty.,1
1,Product was defective and Amazon would not let me return it. Its been just 2 days and the battery is not charging properly. I would recommend you buy it from philips directly.,1
1,"This product leaves a weird 'slime' in your mouth after brushing. For awhile I thought there was something wrong with my gums/teeth, but I finally figured out it was Crest Pro-Health that was causing it! Gross. I am not usually picky about which toothpaste I buy, but I can say with 100% certainty that I will never buy this product again.",1
2,"Though I love Lime Crime's lipsticks, especially Airborne Unicorn, I am not thrilled with this gloss.  The applicator is very tiny making it difficult to apply enough to get the shine expected.  When I was finally able to get a decent amount on, it looked no where near as beautiful as it does in the photo.  Would not buy this product again.",1

1,"I was very eager to order a bottle of Wild Country when it went to $3.00 shipped on sale. When I got it, it had a distinct alcohol smell to it that many fake $5 \\""street scents\\"" have that are being sold on the tables in Manhattan [if you been and experienced it, then you know what I mean]. The actual fragrance scent smells like weak old spice mixed with licorice - not a good combo. I did not enjoyed this fragrance, and maybe the stuff that I received was just a defective batch and hence was such a low price. The best part is the heavy-thich glass bottle and pretty thick-walled plastic cap. Had high hopes for this one but was VERY disappointed and can't recommend it. A quality fake/bootleg fragrance smells better than what I got.",1
1,"I have baught this produce many times in the past and it smells wonderful, this bottle smelt rancid, would not buy again.",1
1,I guess I should have read it better but the fact that you can't return it (first thing I've seen sold directly sold by Amazon you can't return) seems extra fishy.  $35 wasted.,1
2,"I ordered purple, not pink. I received pink.<br /><br />I HATE pink.<br /><br />Now as for the construction of this item, disregarding the lousy color: it's well made, perfect for someone like me who has waist-length hair. I do have concerns about the band. The fit is snug, and the one time I wore it the cap did not slip off, but the band is elastic, not satin, even on the inside. Using this cap every night will more than likely gradually wear the user's hairline right off.<br /><br />I didn't bother to return it. When I clicked the \\""Contact Seller\\"" button for that, the system told me that the seller permitted returns only for 4 days, and they would have to approve my request. Since this was the weekend (rec'd on the 21st) and they couldn't even be bothered to read the order right (I ordered purple, not pink!) I figured my chances of getting a decent resolution for this matter was slim to none. After I used the cap one time I threw it away and the following week I went to a beauty supply store and found what I wanted, an oversized satin cap with a satin band.<br /><br />I would not recommend this seller or this item to anyone. If I could've given them 'no stars' I would have.<br /><br />UPDATE: The week of July 11th I was contacted by a CSR from this seller who offered to either replace the item or issue a refund. I chose the refund. I stand by my comment \\""Let The Buyer Beware\\"" in my earlier review. I've upped the stars to two, because of the seller's response.",1

1,Watered down :(,1
2,"Overall impression: Lasts slightly longer than a regular mani, but nothing like a real gel one.<br /><br />Pros: Easy to do, especially if you aren't good with clean lines. Looks nice while it lasts. Easier to remove than a real gel manicure. Not messy. Price. If your nails aren't too long, you can actually use 1 strip on two nails.<br /><br />Cons: LED has a short and doesn't stay on. When I say short, I mean it doesn't stay on for the normal 30 second period. It goes on for 3 seconds, then flickers out. You restart it and it stays on for 5 seconds, etc. Peels slightly about a week in. CAN chip, even with a few top coats.<br /><br />I think this is an instance of \\""You get what you pay for\\"". I would have given them 3 stars (maybe even 4), but the lamp doesn't stay on consistently. This is a real problem since you can only put one finger in at a time. You can fix the peeling by filing it a bit and applying another clear coat. However, the chipping (which isn't terribly frequent) just is what it is.",1

1,"Where do I start?<br />First off, This isn't Becky. it's her B/F. She bought this kit for me.<br /><br />Gothobby uses UPS, the slowest ground mail in the United States! They need to start using USPS for orders in the US! That way, people get what they ordered when it is supposed to be delivered!<br /><br />UGH!<br />Half the pre-sterilized items that were supposed to be included had ripped open packages. If I have to explain what that means, then you have no reason ordering tattoo equipment! This is a very, VERY, BIG DEAL!<br />One of the machines has a bad capacitor and runs too slow to use as a liner or a shader. Changing the power supply setting does not alter how this machine runs. It is broken, or has the wrong build!<br />Also, when you look at the pics for this kit, there's a black diamond textured s/s grip ( I hope it's S/S ). I never even received that! I only got three grips. The ones no one will actually use.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />The above mistakes were corrected fast. Had replacements in 3 days at no cost to me.<br /><br />Now, for an actual equipment review.<br />Machines:<br />If these are 10 wrap coils I will eat one of the machines. I would have to guess 6 wrap, or at the most 8. Not 10!! The frame where the tube incerts on all machines was bent down, making tube placement difficult, and made the needles ride very hard against the bottom of the tube resulting in severe slowdown, and super fast needle wear. The screws that should have been teflon securing the front binding post and set screw, were mere plastic and broke upon trying to adjust them. The spring, contact screw, and armature bar nipple were not even alligned, and upon trying to adjust the machines, they got even slower due to the slow coils and the true circiut being broke after any adjustments. You get what you pay for, and I got nothing useful with these machines!<br /><br />Power Supply:<br />I can't even call it that. There isn't enough current being created by this power source to make the machines run like they should when a tube and needle bar are placed on the machine. Then again, that may be a result of not only '8' wrap coils and bad power, but the capicitors seem to be wrong as well.<br /><br />Tubes:<br />They aren't even stainless steel, they are aluminum! You can't sterilize them, they just pit and rust out.<br /><br />Grips:<br />The screws on the grips stripped out the first time setting them to the tube and tip.<br /><br />Needles:<br />Less then good. They are cheap and not worthy of being used to tattoo with.<br /><br />Overall:<br />I understand that this was a cheap kit, and I knew I would be getting some less then staller gear. I just didn't realize that everything was going to be useless. Not one thing in this kit will last beyond two tattooes! If you are a serious tattooer you will never buy from this supplier! If you are some scratcher working from your bedroom or a mildew infested basement, you will be very happy with this kit.<br /><br />I do not reccomend this supplier. Go pro or don't go at all!ake the machines run like they should when a tube and needle bar are placed on the machine.

The only thing I noticed was my hair's texture became really rough and it seemed like it made my hair really dry and my hair broke off.  I used it for about 2 months until the whole bottle (along with the conditioner) was gone.  I would not recommend this product.,1
1,I haven't used the item as yet so I will reserve judgement on the product although I do have a complaint.

Now I have a giant patch on the side of my head with short crappy looking hair.

2,"This product has an overwhelmingly large number of reviews that are gushing and overly positive, but when you actually read them you find things like \\""Wow this gets closer than my old electric razor I haven't shaved with a blade in years but this is fantastic shaving with safety razor is great\\"" or \\""this is technically more frugal because blades themselves are so cheap so after the intro price...\\"" and of course \\""I'm 19 years old with a thin patchy beard and I just tried this thing and it works great!\\"" Now there isn't anything inherently wrong with what a lot of the reviewers here are saying  but they don't tell you anything about the blade itself.<br /><br />Before I go on to write what will likely go on to be a wordy, potentially rambling review of this product I'd like to just tell you what I think about this product. For the price there are better razors out there. For a few dollars less you can get a higher quality parker unit that opens up from the top instead of requiring you to take the entire head off and looks better, and personally I found it gave a slightly better shave. So the early summary is if you want to get this because \\""well merkur does sound familiar as an old timey razor company\\"" then skip it or maybe try something more expensive, personally I haven't tried those out yet because, as I said earlier most reviews on these razors are useless thanks to people just gushing over how they've never shaved this way before instead of actually reviewing the device.<br /><br />Anyway onto the detailed nitpicking about this device. The first problem you'll run into with this blade is you have to take apart the entire head in order to insert the blade. It takes a few times to get used to doing this properly, but even when you do it's still a bit of a clumsy procedure. It's a bit cheap of the blade to be build this way instead of the usual way of twisting the handle and letting the top open up allowing for easy replacement of the blades. Overall it's a bit cheapon the manufacturers part and there are cheaper razors on this very site that offer the butterfly hinge on the head of the razor.<br /><br />Another problem with the quality of the bottom lip of the device. It's the safety part of a safety razor and it's what keeps you from chopping little chunks of flesh off of your face, but this particular razor just has it too long, too thick, and the opening for the blade itself is a little bit too tight. The end result is that it takes a lot more effort to get an actual close shave. Trying to adjust the opening only leads to loosening the entire unit and letting it slide around and cult up your face and I know you have to hold it at an angle but my beard hairs are dark, thick, and they keep low to my face. I have managed to get a close shave with this, but it was with feather blades and great effort that I managed to do it. My new parker has a similar problem without being adjustable but it's at least a bit better at getting close than this ever was. In the end if you want a good shave skip this and move onto something else.",1
2,The product ran out very quickly and didn't stay on my lips as i thought Volumizer would do . this was the 2nd time i tried it,1
1,"I have used several inexpensive single blade safety razors in the past. This one is by far the worst. It does not shave your face, it scrapes it free of hair and skin. I have cut myself once in my 33 years of shaving, prior to using this product; since receiving it, I have had three large cuts. The provided blades are also inferior products, that are not sized correctly for use in the razor. Look elsewhere.",1
1,"These oils were spoiled, I cannot use them, so I never will buy these anymore, waste of money I rather buy them in a store I am very, very disappointed with this",1
1,"The item seemed to do a very nice job for the short time in which it was operational; it left my mouth feeling very fresh.  However, the motor conked out after 5 days.  In some ways, that's almost a good thing--it's twice as easy to return mere days after purchase than if it hung on for a couple of months before dying.",1
1,"I am very disappointed with this product and really wish I could send it back. I doesn't condition my hair as well as some less expensive products I have used. I read the reviews on it and thought I would give it a try. My hair is dry and brittle now, I can't wait to condition my hair with Kenra.",1
1,Received the wrong color,1
2,"not only does it not seem to be competing to the older Gillette I used to use, but it scratches my skin with its corners. Not cool, I'd deffinately look for a differend kind ext time",1
1,The picture of the product shows a jar of cream; what you actually get is 3 small bars of soap.  Deceptive.,1
2,This product appears to be sturdier than the product you can buy in the local stores.  However the blades are not sharp enough to cut cuticles so it kind of defeats the purpose.,1
2.0,"I've been using this serum twice daily under Algenist eye cream. The Algenist does a good job of taking care of small crows feet and mild puffiness, but I haven't yet found anything to combat the dark circles (other than sleep). Even my favorite eye cream by La Mer doesn't touch them, but I hoped a serum that claimed to help might do just that.<br /><br />This serum is fairly thick and rich for a serum (which I like), rather than watery like others I've tried. It has a light fragrance of roses, which dissipates fairly quickly. It absorbs a little slowly, but doesn't leave the skin tacky or with any residue. I'm also happy this doesn't cause any reaction in my sensitive skin. There might be a tiny bit more moisture in the skin on days when I use this.<br /><br />That said, I haven't noticed that it really does anything noticeable. The skin under my eyes looks pretty much exactly the same as it does on the days I've forgotten to put this on, with the possible exception noted above (I can't tell if it's in my head). There's no tightening, no smoothing, and I definitely don't notice any change in the dark circles. Maybe for others whose circles aren't genetic (as I assume mine are) would have better luck. I'm definitely not left with skin that's any more &#34;radiant, hydrated and youthful,&#34; or &#34;more supple and luminous.&#34; For the price, I'd expect a whole lot more.<br /><br />Some of the benefits may take a while to show up, so I'll update my review if anything changes. For now, I just can't recommend this for the price.",1
1,"I bought this because it was on sale (2.99) from a local store and thought I would try it.  I opened the activator bottle and the smell was intense, but familiar.  I then realized it was super glue after I had applied it to my nails.  I figured I would try it though, but it chipped the same day.  I removed it the next morning.  Glad I did not pay full price for it.",1
1,"The lotion arrived when I was ill, so it was several weeks before I opened it. I was completely shocked to find the color was yellow. The consistency was watery with small clumps in it. The scent was almost gone. In a word, ick.<br /><br />I've been using this brand of lotion for years, and I've never seen this happen. The one I'm currently using has been open for over a year and hasn't changed color or consistency or scent, so this must be extremely old, or else it was defective from the beginning.<br /><br />Great price, but hardly worth it if the product is low quality. Very disappointing.",1
1,"Had great hopes for this product, but was greatly disappointed.  Have medium shoulder length hair and used recommended # of sprays, blow dried hair and used flat iron.  I really did not see any significant difference and did not care for feeling of residue on my hair.",1
1,I though this was a good price for the number of stickers included but the fact that they don't stay stuck to your nails makes them worthless...,1
2,"I had one of these flat irons for a few years and it worked great. After about 3 years, it just stopped turning on for no reason. I got a new one and it lasted a year and ended up not turning on again for no reason what so ever one day. Just for the fact that I've had two of the same exact product just stop working in the same way, makes these flat irons too unreliable. Would recommend for someone who doesn't mind buying a brand new one every year.",1
1.0,Whatever I got it was not Clinique. It has a fragrance and leaves a tingling feeling on my face. The texture and smell remind me a little of mint toothpaste. I called Clinique and they assured me that their product has no fragrance and no tingle. It does seems to clean my face OK.,1
1,The wig was a different color and it was incredibly shiny. I would never be able to wear it in public unless I was truly going for the &#34;fake hair&#34; look.,1

2,Definitely not as good as I wxpecte d it to be a little disappointed,1
1,Didn't hold my hair together at all! I have thick hair. The springs on these are really weak so they can't stay shut strong enough to actually keep my hair up. don't bother.,1
1,permanently messed up my hair after one use. don't use.,1
1,"This product may work for some people but I have super sensitive skin. I used two patches on two different pimples. Although the patches did dry the acne, but later I developed these little painful bumps almost rash-like, which I reckon are from the glue in the patches. Now I am dealing with the painful bumps and redness. Don't purchase these overpriced patches if you have sensitive skin.",1
1,Not the same fragrance. Barely any fragrance at all. Contacted the seller and they contacted the distributor who said to warm it up to restore fragrance. No difference. It has to be that the formulation has changed. Disappointed.,1
1,"This thing did not work at all, there is no point in buying it, so noone should buy it at all",1
2,They came off really easily.  I had them on for less than an hour before they started to come off.,1
2,"I was so excited to use this. After my first use, I realized I probably should  have purchased the conditioner too. My hair was so dry and bleh. I do love the smell and the tingly feeling of the peppermint oils. It feels weird not to lather my shampoo. I really don't notice a difference in my hair being &#34;cleaner&#34; or not. I guess I really will have to see if there is a difference with the conditioner.",1
2,"I tried using this to reduce dark scarring on my legs from scratching mosquito bites.  Didn't make a difference at all.  Smells good and isn't drying, but didn't do it's job as far as I'm concerned.",1
1,It add more protection on my iPhone plus and fit just right,1
2,"Recently, Gojo changed the color and fragrance of this product.  It is now yellow, and has a different fragrance.  I would describe the original amber-colored soap as unscented  The new version has a slight 'soapy' smell that I cannot abide.",1

1,"I would not recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.<br />I am a very pale, freckled face 20 year old with super sensitive skin.<br />I thought that this being a &#34;moisture rescue&#34; type of product it would moisturize my skin,<br />it didn't. It cause very bad dry patches all over my face instead.<br />Will be throwing the rest of this jar in the garbage, maybe this was meant for people with<br />oily skin? I have normal skin and have never had this bad of a reaction before.",1
1,The back strap was ripped when I received it and there are a ton of hanging strings. Not a happy customer,1
1,"I heard good things about this line of products, so I tried this item. It is very heavily scented, which drove me crazy - I felt like I had dipped my face in cheap perfume. It also burned a little.  It does go on smoothly and didn't leave any residue, so maybe if you don't have sensitive skin or a sensitive nose. Just know that others with you will probably smell it on you.",1
1,"I liked the idea of this brush... I'm always looking for good dandruff control (in addition to my regular routine of Head & Shoulders shampoo and conditioner). I thought this would replace my regular daily brush. However, it's not at all practical as a brush, since it shouldn't be used on wet hair or for detangling. Also, it needs to be used to brush your roots, so it doesn't matter at all for the rest of your hair. You're supposed to brush the roots several times a day, however, whenever I did this it agitated the dandruff and I ended up looking like a mess. Lesson learned, so I ended up using this only when I wasn't leaving the house (i.e. bedtime). And the final strike against this brush was that even when brushing the roots when I could (once a day before bed), I noticed ZERO improvement. Wasted money for me!",1
1,"There is no such Company known as Amore Mio or they use the designer O'Ro Gold and O'Ro Gold, ( the real oro)  doesn't make Brushes at all.  This is an item whose name is stolen.",1
1,"I was really hoping this would be a good deep conditioning treatment, especially for protein purposes.  But, no such luck.  Used it after my wash and sat under a dryer for about 20 mins.  After rinsing, it wasn't all that good of a detangler.  My hair wasn't very difficult to comb while wet, but there was some snagging.  After roller setting & drying, my hair was VERY HEAVY.  There was no bounce in my hair, it's absolutely flat & blah.  Wrapping my hair took more effort than it should.  Since it's so weighed down, my hair doesn't even keep the shape.  To the touch, it almost feels like I heavily greased my hair with vaseline.  With that said, I'm still on the hunt for a good protein deep conditioner that doesn't weigh my hair down or feel greasy.",1
2,"I had jaw surgery that left me w/o the sensory nerves to the chin/lower lip... forcing me to use chapstick. I have used a lot of different products, and this one definitely rates towards the bottom for the following reasons:<br /><br />1. The applicator is REALLY small. And while it's good that I don't get this stuff all over my face since I can't feel it when I apply the chapstick to the bottom lip, it takes multiple swipes to make it happen. Not THAT big of a deal, but who has lips THAT small? Children, maybe? Maybe this is a chapstick for children... not sure.<br />2. It doesn't last. I'm in the tropics right now, and I've noticed that my other two chapstick types (Bronner's and Eos) both last a lot longer in general. This one feels like when I was back in the States in the great north - constant application. :( That's not good... and I find it ridiculous that when I'm in such a humid place that I need to apply as much as I do w/ softlips.<br /><br />Unfortunately w/ the price of this stuff, I felt like I was getting a deal... but turns out that now I'm stuck w/ a lot of chapstick that just doesn't do it for me. I do seem to find that due to chemistry, some chapstick works well for some people and not for others. In this case, it does not work for me. Maybe it's the perfect chapstick for other people (clearly that is the case due to the other reviews). I guess that what I'm saying is that I suggest that you check this out from the store first (one tube) and then go from there. Having a bunch of this stuff when you don't like it kinda stinks. Unfortunately given that I don't live in the States right now I had to give it shot un-tested. I should have just gone for the more expensive stuff that was already working for me. Live and learn, I guess...",1
1,"I placed the order on March 14th and received it on April 9th, almost an entire month later.

Granted it only costs 0.87 cents, this is the worst purchase expereince ever.",1

1,They were so small they would only fit someone with very small feet.  Bad idea,1
1,"I wish I would have read these reviews before trying this product, though I am not sure it would have made a difference--I probably would still have bought it. I have never had a reaction to a moisturizer or sunscreen or even make-up before, but while applying my third application of this I noticed the red rash on my cheeks that others have mentioned. I've used other Oil of Olay products with no incident, and I was actually trying to switch to this from the Neutrogena anti-aging product I had been using simply because of the name brand. Didn't work.     Aside from the rash, I was also not a fan of the texture of this product--it was thicker and greasier than I had expected, more of a traditional sunscreen than a moisturizer. All over disappointing.",1
2,"I had to re-sew in the clips because the sewing job was horrible; all of the clips came undone after I wore them once! These were so expensive and cheap! I would not buy from this seller, they ship all the way from the UK.",1
1,"I never thought I'd be caught dead writing a deodorant review!  I bought this product thinking that I had found a bargain.  I was previously using Degree Clinical and found that this product had just 19% content of the key active ingredient vs 20% in the &#34;clinical&#34; product.  I figured that the rest of the product was inert and simply irrelevant to its performance.<br /><br />Well, the good news is that this stuff is cheap.  The bad and the ugly is that it performs horribly when compared to my previous &#34;clinical&#34; strength product.  For a man who prides himself in good hygiene, I found that I couldn't stand being with myself after about 4-6 hours of wearing this stuff.  Frankly, I don't think that it was performing better than if I had just skipped putting on any deodorant.  Yep... that bad!<br /><br />A bargain price is only a bargain if it works.  Forget this stuff and buy one of the better products.",1
1,This is the worst trimmer I have ever bought.  It takes twice as long a others because the hair gets stuck in the vacuum so you keep having to empty it out and then clean it.    DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.    Steve,1

Unfortunately for me, after 2 months of taking 4 capsules a day, my hair is just as thin and I actually see my hair falling out faster then before. Not one claim of theirs has proven true. I have to question the validity of these other reviews as there is no way any hair product is going to give &#34;significant results&#34; in a month much less this one.",1
1,Don't bother. The blonde didn't cover half of my grey hairs and I'm about 60% gray. Waste of time and money. I followed the instructions precisely. The sides of my hair and top isn't colored AT ALL! I also ran out of product half way through and my hair isn't that long. I've been coloring my hair for 8 years and NEVER ran out of color. I want my money back!,1
1,"I really wanted to like this mask, or whatever you want to call it. As someone who struggles with oily combination skin, I felt like this mask was too astringent and drying, which is weird because my skin produces so much sebum. After washing the mask off, my face always got dry and patchy even after putting moisturizer on. Maybe it just wasn't the product for my skin, which is actually kinda delicate. I'd suggest something gentler if you have sensitive skin, or even normal skin, because it just seemed too harsh. Don't ever use this during winter months, especially if you live up north. After applying it, when it was drying on my skin, I felt itchy. After a few days I started to break out. I was so disappointed.<br />However, do try it if you know your skin isn't sensitive, and even if you hate it, you only spent 10 dollars at most :)",1

2.0,"I am very glad I tried the samples.  I don't use conditioner.  Way back,  when I was a child, people used stale beer, vinegar or lemon juice as conditioner.  I've never liked using rinses.<br /><br />I started using shampoo bars in the 1970s because:<br />  I like squeaky clean hair.<br />  The packaging for bar shampoo is paper.  I try to keep a plastic free house and this means a lot to me.<br />  Bar shampoo lasts much longer than liquid shampoo.<br />  If you take the paper off any bar soap or shampoo and let it dry, it lasts even longer.<br />  If the bar is allowed to dry after using it extends the life of the bar.<br />  My hair doesn't get split ends when I use bar shampoos.<br />  I don't need a rinse as my hair doesn't tangle when I use bar shampoos.<br /><br />I was particularly glad to see this product line and anxious to try it.  I figured I would buy the egg and lemon bar or the beer bar.  I also like Rosemary.<br /><br />The cons:<br />  My hair didn't squeak.<br />  My hair felt heavy.  It clumped together and took longer drying.<br />  My hair didn't stay &#34;clean&#34; as long.  I am used to washing my hair as part of my bathing ritual.  I am unused to &#34;dirty&#34; hair.<br />  The scents of the wafers sort of mixed and the end result was unpleasant.<br />  The thin wafers have a paper identifier.  If you use the wafer and then try peeling the paper away, the wafer breaks up.<br />  I wash my hair and face with the same bar and use regular soap for my body.  Neck up gets bar shampoo.  Neck down gets bar soap.<br /><br />My face usually feels cleaner than the rest of me.  I feel sure had I used at least a vinegar rinse to cut the residue, my experience would have been different but I don't like using rinses.  Now I don't have the foggiest notion if these things are connected but I scrub and rub my entire head with bar shampoo out of habit then rinse my whole head at one time.  Using these little wafers, I got water in my ears when I rinsed the suds off which surprised me - an unwelcome experience.<br />Someone else could easily have a different experience.  When I looked at the six samples, the only sample I thought I might not was the Moroccan Mud.  I thought I would be purchasing the shampoo I liked the most once I tried the six choices.  Instead, I'll keep looking for my &#34;new&#34; shampoo.",1
2,"I have a very oily t zone and this seemed to make it worse. I was hoping that since everyone seemed to say this was a bit matte that it would help. I know this is not meant to be an oil control type of product but the fact that it made it worse is weird. It did make my face white in strange way, i didn't particularly like it. I am fairly light so it's not that it didn't match my skin tone (in fact it did very well) it's just it made my face a bit strange looking in my opinion. I will say it does feel very light on the my face, i did have to wear powder over it though and blush to kind of make everything blend in nicely. I didn't get any weird reaction to it like some people did which is good. But i'm just not a fan. I feel like I could've bought something way cheaper than this and it would've done just fine. This product really does absolutely nothing for me. I will not be buying again. The only reason it gets 2 stars is because I like the way it feels on my skin, very light and also shipping was amazingly quick.",1

It lathered well, smell wasn't over powering and it didn't make my boyfriend (who has extreme sensitive skin) itch or anything.<br /><br />Fast forward several months, I finally find it on Amazon. I bought two of them and me and my boyfriend started using it. The next morning, he wakes up really itchy and red patches all over his chest. He discontinues its use and it goes away. I tell him (my skin is not nearly as sensitive as his, and I never use on my face) I'll continue to use it because it doesn't bother me. I use it for a few more days and I start getting the same things as him (itchy,red patches etc) I stop using it and buy a different soap and it hasn't happened again. My question is: What happened? It used to be a great soap. I'm not sure if mine have expired or not (cannot find a date on bottle)<br />I don't want to recommend a different soap on a review for a product, but I would recommend not using this soap.

1,"Cheaply made. If you want people to know you're wearing a wig, get this one. You could see the wefts in the back of the wig it was so thin.",1
2,"no instructions come with it but if you research it you will find that after dipping your needle you will then need to dip it in water to get the ink to take, not a good choice for a professional who wants to do amazing work",1
1,"A lotion dispenser is pictured, however, one did not arrive w/the bottles.  :(  Very disappointed!<br /><br />Inconvenient to unscrew the lid & put it back on each time you want to use.",1
2,"I ordered the &#34;T-outliner head&#34; (exactly what is shown in the product picture) but received the square head blade. I called to inform about the mistake and was told that I would need to ship the wrong blade back and then wait to be sent the correct blade. I was annoyed by this and needed a blade asap so I just kept the square head blade.<br /><br />In terms of the square head blade, its not all that great. Out of the box (without adjusting blade), the pro-mate blade cuts slightly better than the factory andis blade. BUT, if you adjust and zero the andis blade, it is MUCH better. I used the promate blade for about 6 months, didnt like it too much, switched back to the andis blade and am very impressed.",1
2,You can't tell it's for red hair until you see the bottle. ONLY FOR RED HUED HAIR!,1
2,Tiny tiny bottles. The procut is fine but the small Amount isn't worth the price.,1
2,I had higher expectations for this product. I have used this for a year and noticed no change in my skin. I could skip this step altogether and notice no difference. I am disappointed but will try another brand next.,1
1,A worthless &#34;upgrade&#34; to the old HQ12.  Now just a terrible shave that ruined what was a great razor.  Don't waste your money on this replacement.,1
1,"My boyfriend loves this product. I bought my own and started with bleeding of my gums.  I thought that'll stop after a while, but it just got worse.  I started to notice my inner mouth felt funny afterwards, like the walls of my mouth sticking my teeth.  I finally asked my boyfriend if he ever felt these symptoms, but he never did. After looking online, I found out the sticky feeling inside my mouth was from the inner skin peeling and sticking to my teeth.  I have noticed my lips were much more chapped than before. I discontinued the use of this product.<br /><br />Does anyone know what ingredient is doing this? I would like to avoid it next time.  For now, I'll go back to my previous toothpaste.",1
2,It didnt work for me. I didnt see any change.<br />I faithfully put it on and did it for over 4 weeks.<br />It was a lot of money for me to see no change.,1
1,I ordered the 12 colored one for my daughter and what she got was all silver Rinestones I am not pleased with the fact she didnt get what we ordered,1

2,"I have never had much success with any products in the Nivea for Men Sensitive line, but I decided to give this a try because I don't like heavily-fragranced face washes. I honestly thought this was disgusting because of the consistency. It did not lather for me at all but was very similar in texture and consistency to personal lubricant jelly. It also had a heavy chemical scent which was most unpleasant. I love Nivea for Men products but can't recommend this given how unusual it is. [[ASIN:B001FB5IG4 Nivea for Men Face Wash Cleans and Moisturizing with Menthol and Vitamin E, 5-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)]] is a good product, though.",1
2,Ok..  Very small sizes for the cost,1
1,Don't waste your time. Made my skin look worse! I am going to try a stronger peel to fix the damage. Didn't peel after the 3rd time of use.,1
1,I was not sure of this product from the source because of its package and contents that were unsecure.  Be cautioned when purchasing items that are not secure and not in an original state.,1
1,Too strong. I used years ago. Its not the same. I will not purchase again. The formula must have changed.,1
1,"To be fair, I cannot actually review the dryer itself. I received the dryer with the diffuser attachment missing, which renders it pretty much useless for me. I also received a black & purple dryer, which is not a big deal, but receiving an item that does not include attachments included in the description & a different color when it was not stated that colors may vary, makes me wonder whats happening in quality control. Frustrating.",1
2,"Am not seeing any positive  results yet, after 2 weeks of use.",1
1,"I only purchased these because the order was fulfilled by Amazon - I had seen the warnings about knockoffs being sold, and that was supposedly how to ensure you were getting the real deal. It didn't matter, THEY WERE STILL FAKE. Don't waste your time, pay full price in a store where you know what you're getting. Never again.",1
1,Smells so bad,1
2,It caused irritation in my skin.,1
1.0,This diffuser shoots the mist up about a foot and then it just falls to the floor. It doesn't diffuse the essential oil into the air at all. You must stand right next to it to smell the oil. I'm not sure why this diffuser has such good reviews?,1
1.0,Didn't work at all.,1
1,After using this rinse with toothpaste a week. I am losing my taste sense.<br />I am a really avereage person who doesn't have sepecific allegy.<br />This product is dangerous!,1
2,I've been using the product now as directed for a couple weeks and have seen absolutely no benefit to my hair or skin.,1
1,Very MISLEADING. Rollers are not small for short hair. Box says small size when actually medium rollers. Don't buy if have hair less than 3 inches long otherwise end up with straight hair.,1
2,"I was hoping this would be another great product from Pixi, since I'm in love with their peach color correcting concealer.<br /> I have sensitive combination skin and I'm prone to breakouts. I thought this primer would be fine since it says it's hypoallergenic, oil-free, and it even has salysillic acid in the ingredient list. I wore it for the first time all day, and my pores did indeed look smaller under my mineral makeup and my fine lines were slightly improved. But the next morning, I woke up with the worst breakout I've had in years. I didn't want to think the primer caused it, but since it was the only thing new in my routine at the time I think it must be the culprit. For those without acne prone skin, this might be a great product. It just wasn't good for me at all.",1
1,It broke after 1 day. Cheap looking and feeling.,1
1,"Bought this bar soap hoping it was a good exfoliant but it didn't do hardly anything, except make my skin itch, and itch, AND itch!  It lathers up really well, smells nice, but is very drying, and the exfoliant grains are barely noticeble.  Would not buy this soap again.  I'll go back to my old favorite, Dove bar soap.",1
1,"This palette is not an authentic MAC product, if you google \\""cheap Mac products\\"" you'll find many websites that are selling FAKE MAK products for very cheap, but if you are willing to buy them is up to you. I just hate that they have to copy a brand when they are not the real deal!!  I THINK THAT SELLERS SHOULD MENTION THAT THEY ARE NOT SELLING AUTHENTIC products because a lot of people don't know they are fake.",1
2,Good,1
1,"I got around Last weekend , in between I tried to use this Shaver 3 times, though it was written that there will be irritations in Skin when you use for the First time, which I took the Brunt...<br />But even after using 2 - 3 Times, I am now in total Mess, my Face has lots of cuts throughout my chin & neck Area...<br />The Shaver does not does a clean shave at all. After shaving it appeared my Skin was burning and my ears where Red.<br />I used an aftershave it almost made me cry, it was such a painful experience.<br />Moreover , something which I can do from a Blade in 2 - 5 mins , it takes me more than 15 mins even though I do not have much of Beard.<br /><br />Not a Good Shaver at all, I seriously do not recommend this Shaver at all.<br />Please do not buy it.",1
1.0,"I wished the color actually matched what it looks like in the picture but it doesn't. It's so bright and has a silvery tint to it. It is too much, it's not a hint of color it is overpowering!",1
1,This is the 2nd one I ordered and it does not fit! The description of the model # was correct in the ad. I DID NOT FIT!,1
2,This product does not hold enough water to do a good job of flossing.  It is empty before the job is 1/2 completed.,1
2,"Works well but it is way too expensive, in the store it's much cheaper. And the bottle is a small size. You got to be kidding.",1
1.0,It worked one time.  Will only shoot  water through nozzle.,1
1,"Took a long time to come, and not pleased with the color.",1
1.0,I hate how this matte lipgloss looks I ended up buying a different type of NYX nude gloss,1
1,It is definitely a good deodorant  but I ran out in 2 weeks! I don't think I can afford buying it every 2-3 weeks.,1
1,Bought this for my mother.  Bonnet was very cheaply made and hard to connect.  Wouldn't recommend for anyone. Finally had to buy a hard bonnet type.,1
2.0,I do not recommend this product.<br />Vibration is to much and when charging the blue light is way too bright...Will light up the entire room.,1
1,Very bad product! You need to pass several times to straight your hair.,1
2,"Well, this product doesnt agree with me.  I must be doing something very wrong here since there are some really great reviews.  My curls just dont stay in!  I've had an Avon hot roller system (dont really remember details) and it actually curled my hair much better than this Caruso kit.  I think the moisture from the steam makes my curls flop.  No matter how long I leave the rollers in, (half a day or maybe just 15 minutes), I get no lasting curls.  The sponges also wear out pretty quickly.  I've probably only used them two or three times and the sponges look like they already need replacing.  My hair is very fine... so probably hot curlers would work better.  I mustered up two stars for this review because the kit comes with quite a lot of rollers...",1
1,This bottle was also half full didn't know if it leaked out or what but there wasn't much in the bottle,1
1,This curler doesn't even curl my hair with product. It is useless to me. I am upset I even bought it.,1
2,Looks very cute - but quite unusable - as the bag is almost 2-dimensional,1
1,"When I buy it I felt really guilty for spending so much on a simple sponge, but I go by the reviews. very bad decision. when I began to use it I really liked the finish that I got, but after a couple of days I  use it.......!!!<br />my skin started to feel horrible, like sandy. didn't matter to wash my face or if to exfoliate, didnt work at all. I had to pay for me to have a facial.This &#34;WONDERFUL SPONGE&#34;  cover my pores  horrible!",1
1,Did not work. Did not return.,1
2,"The product itself is great, I used it before and I wouldn't order it otherwise. But this time the bottle leaked and came in 1/4 empty and it was all mess. I don't know if it was opened before or it was just lack of packing",1
2,"i did get any benefit from it still i suffer from dandruff, so i can't say its good so i don't recommend it.",1
2,I'm not a fan of this cologne.  I should have known though not to buy a cologne without smelling it first.  I read the reviews and thought I'd give it a try anyhow as some people really liked it.  It really is a matter of someone's taste on what they like.  I won't buy cologne again over the Net without smelling it first somewhere else and KNOW that I like it.  The low review was because I was not fond of it.  Others though may give it a high review because they like it.,1
2,"None of the pictures posted resemble the actual color of the bottle or the color in the bottle. Disappointed. ESPECIALLY because it was an &#34;add-on&#34; item and it wouldn't let me purchase without adding $25 to my cart. So I bought 3 other shades which also looked nothing like pictured. Not to mention, the $25 this is supposed to be for shipping purposes, yet they still came in two separate shipments. Total bologna. I went to every Target looking for this shade and they were all sold out, even online. That is the ONLY reason I went through with this order. Until Amazon ex-nays this &#34;add-on&#34; item thing, I will no longer buy from them. ALSO, as if forcing you to put $25 or more worth of product in your cart isn't bad enough, they're picky about what you add! I put a $19 phone case in my cart and it said since it ships from a different location, I STILL had to add more to my cart. I called customer service to see if there was anyway I could just pay for whatever shipping charges and was told NO - I MUST add $25+ to my cart.  Amazon has lost their marbles as well as a VERY loyal customer.",1
1,This item is very hard to use. We do not use it and do not recommend it. It is almost impossible to use after you take your glasses off,1
1,"Loved this product BEFORE,they changed the formula. HATE the new product formulation. Sticky gooey pasty greasy.PLEASEPLEASEPLEASE. bring back the old 30 spf 18.6 %zinc formula.",1
1,I thought that it was a soft sponge not a rubber sponge......rubber sponge is not what I want to apply make up,1
1,These do not stick at all. So disappointed! I am disappointed I bought so many.  Won't do it again ever.,1
1,I gave them a low rating because they don't cut hardly at all. Sorry about the bad review but it's the true. I tried many of these and these didn't pan out for us.,1
2,Used 9 applications and realized only a very slight tanning.,1
2,The manicure pedicure caddy is not powerful enough. I didn't even see a reorder sheet for the accessories.<br />very disappointed.,1
1,Ez flow is a cheap acrylic. When you mix it with monomer it dries so quickly.! I really hate it.,1
2.0,"For some reason, they don't seem to last nearly as long as others I've purchased from Gillette",1
2,"Have had this razor for quite some time. It replaced an old Remington that was pretty awesome; sadly the Panasonic has just never been that good. The adjustable head comes loose, the attachment comb is worthless (didn't stay on and pulled hairs - ouch), now after several years, the unit doesn't keep a charge for very long. Sorry that I invested in replacement blades/foil last year. It's also pretty loud. Never used it wet - if I could shave in the shower, I would just use a blade.",1
1,I believe the product was expired. It didn't do anything for my eyelashes. I've tried this same product before and it worked very well.<br />I won't be ordering this product from the vendor.,1
2,this deodorant has an odd scent and doesn't last long (that may actually be a good thing)  look elsewhere for pit wax,1
1,It made my hair horribly flat and thin. Which I thought would be the opposite for this product.  Quite disapointing.,1
1,"I bought one of these when I couldn't find the white pads for my old Maybelline curler. I'm older (maybe that's part of the reason), but I couldn't even get my lashes in the thing. It pinches the very outer edges of the lashes only. Worthless to me.... I loved Maybelline, but now I'm reading that they've \\""improved\\"" that one and it no longer works for most people. I have no idea what to buy now!",1
2,Package arrived very quickly however they aren't what I was expecting I guess.  I attempted to try them and found it very hard for them to adhere to the brow area ... trying to place them with tweezers and holding them in place proved to be a task ... I will continue to try and work with them due to the amount that I paid but I can't honestly say I would recommend them.  Especially not at the asking price.  Good luck ... and if anyone has any pointers for use please by all means let me know ... Thanks,1
1.0,It did not help with gout and other muscle pain. Overwhelming smell,1
1,I'm not very happy with this product after i apply it on my face with my compressor it takes way to long to dry sometimes it doesn't dry all day long and my face is sticky. I will be trying something else and can't recommend it to anyone!,1
1,"I bought these thinking that it would be the environmentally conscious thing to do.  As long as I was going to be using wasteful floss picks -- instead of merely floss -- then I could at least get some that were biodegradable.  I won't make that mistake again.<br /><br />I'm not sure whether the picks don't work well because they are made out of starch or whether it is just a bad product.  I'll I know is: they don't work.  I'm returning mine to Amazon.<br /><br />The problem is that after 1-5 teeth of use (or technically the grooves between teeth), the floss ALWAYS comes out of starch on one side of the pick.  The unsuspecting flosser is left with a piece of 1/2 inch floss dangling from one side of the pick.  Obviously this is useless, so he or she must then throw out that pick and get another.  It would take most people at least five to get through an entire mouth.  Of course, if you only have two teeth, this product will probably work fine for you.",1
2,I have fairly fine hair and this doesn't do very well. It sounds like its cutting well but sure misses most for me I still need to use tweezers. I don't understand how it gets so many great reviews.,1
1,"This Revlon clipper style is a poor quality for Revlon.<br />It does not cut, larger and hard to handle.  Revlon<br />needs to go back to the compact style as they have<br />always have been \\""top quality\\"", these are not.<br />I notice on Amazon's web site search the old style is<br />pictured but what you receive is the newer inferior,<br />poor quality clippers.",1
1.0,"I bought these clippers to replace an old set of Wahl clippers that finally bit the dust.<br />I was excited when it arrived because it was cordless and adustable, without using guards. But, when I moved the blades up and down, it moves unevenly, which would give you an uneven cut. Also, the plastic handle area did not fit together right. I returned it before using it, as it was obviously a low quality product.<br /><br /> I did end up buying the similar product from Andis, and have now used them a couple of times. Though it was a roughly the same price, the Andis quality is much higher.",1
1,"I am one of those who saw absolutely not difference in my skin tone.  I used it for at least 3 months.  I am in my 30s, but I have sun spots near my eyes.  I don't see any evening of skin tone or fewer lines (I don't have much to start with). My sun spots did not fade at all.  It felt kind of uncomfortable on, even with water on my face before applying this, the cream is meant to be washed off by the morning, so it feels like this film on my face.",1
1,"The only reason I clicked a star was because it is the only way to write a review. This product gave me a horrible rash and I threw it away after using 3 times. I thought it was from mosquitos, but it was from this product. I'm not allergic to wheat, so there is something in this product that I'm allergic to.",1
1,"These pencils are very difficult to smear on the eye. They are obviously extremely low quality. Also, many of the colors are suited for lip pencils not eye pencils. I only found 2 out of the entire package that I could use for eye pencils. Now I worry that I'm stretching my eye tissue because of the pressure I need to apply to get the color to come off the pencil. Don't buy these. They are a waste of money. Go to Wal Mart. The quallity and color will be better.",1
1,"I would not recommend these hot rollers. It is impossible to roll the hair around them....just slides off. The clips do not fit the rollers, so they just spring out of the rolled hair. I took these on a trip out of town and literally threw them in the trash can in the room....weren't worth bringing home!",1
2,"I bought this for my teen, they were a great price, but very low quality. She had a hard time getting them to show up when applied.",1
2,The bristles are too soft for anyone with thick or long hair.  It will not got through the hair to the scalp.  It is probably good for those with thin hair.,1
2,"I ordered 3 of these mousse shadows in rose, champagne, and lilac. Having previously purchased one 2-3 years ago, I knew what to expect -- a soft, shimmering creme that is natural and doesn't cake on the lid or settle into lines. Now that it has been discontinued, its been difficult to find ... so, I picked up several here.<br /><br />What a disappointment! The rose shadow was separating into solids and liquids. The lilac went on clumpy and rolled up onto little balls on my lid and cheek. The champagne was soft and glowing as it should be.<br /><br />Clearly, these are old products that are hardly worth anything. My advice - see if you can't find them at the dollar store. But bypass purchasing them here. I'm out $25 for product worth less than $5.",1
1,"The shave cream smelled awful. I had never smelled sandalwood before so I thought maybe its just me. Then I visited a local wet shave shop and smelled numerous sandalwood shave creams, they all smelled nice. I ended up buying a different brand of sandalwood cream. I read a lot of reviews on this site and others and this product got a lot of good reviews so I'm not sure what the deal was with the stuff I recieved.",1
1,"However, when I received mine, one of the two jars was not sealed and the top was wet.  I was Leary of using it.  I got really busy and forgot to return it before the deadline. I have used this product before and really liked it!",1
1,"I placed this item in my cart and accidentally removed it when purchasing a bunch of other items.  Was bummed out but quickly became excited when I found it in CVS. I applied it immediately and was very excited with results. My nails which are usually long and whitish in color (i wanted them whiter) were transformed into a beautiful rosy color and looked the healthiest I have ever seen them. Because of their attractive natural look I wore Pink Armour alone.  Approximately 2 - 2 1/2 weeks later I noticed a very slight white patch in the center of one of my thumbnails. I assumed it was the nail polish lifting from my finger and so removed it a few days later to to reapply.  Upon removing the polish it became clear that what had actually happened , my nail was peeling deeply in the MIDDLE of my nail bed.  Ever the optimist I convinced myself this was a fluke and kept in on my other fingers...bad move.  I now have three fingers that have deep peels in the middle of my nail beds. I had to cut my nails as low as possible because it is obvious they would rip if they get caught on anything.<br /><br />Additionally, each time I immerse my hands in water i have to use a cuticle trimmer to snip the nail in the middle of my finger.  The nail underneath is extremely thin (a level above the skin) and very sensitive.  My friends who have seen my fingers are mortified and actually told me i should sue. I think it is more important that I warn people that this could happen.  I use my hands a lot in conversation and have been hiding my hands because they are so unattractive and I catch people staring.<br /><br />I know there are many who will simply believe this is an isolated case (and it might well be) but it is worth doing a test on one finger (maybe a pinky) for a free weeks to see if you have a similar reaction.  I do not know what will happen when the peeling gets to the top of my nail bed but I image it will be painful. I hope this helps someone. Someone needs to figure out what is in this stuff. It is NOT SAFE!!! Would give negative stars if I could!!",1

I wish I never bought it and I will never order from this seller again.,1
1.0,I usually love Honey Girl products but this lip balm may have been past the expiration date.,1
1,I tried  the fragrance at a local store. A spritz on a piece of paper still had fragrance after a few days. I purchased a bottle from Amazon to take advantage of the free shipping. The fragrance is similar to that in the store tester but not nearly as strong and fades very quickly.,1
1,"Not sure why this is called a whitening tray and not sure exactly what it is at all, but this product cannot be used as a whitening tray.",1
1,"I am not writing this review off of memory.  This is a direct comparison to what I have sitting on my shelf.  I immediately noticed that the color of the product was not the same; yes the glass container is, but the cologne is not.  Ultimately color of the product does not matter, you do not wear this for its color....However, the scents are not the same.  My current/original bottle is heavier on the pine, sandlewood, and black pepper notes.  They are almost none existent in the product I received.  Bottom line, not the same.",1

2,"I recently got Invisalign. Although it's aesthetically better looking than conventional braces, it is a major inconvenience. I have to brush my teeth after EVERY meal. Since I can't bring my personal toothbrush and toothpaste to a formal restaurant, I purchased this. The toothpaste doesn't taste like toothpaste. In fact, I couldn't even tell if it was working. Furthermore, the brush is hard. It's like rubbing sandpaper against your teeth. It made my gums bleed. I'm going to keep using this product since I have no other options, but this product is a disappointment.",1

1,Have been using this product for a couple months now and have not noticed any difference.  If anything it looks like I've lost more hair.  Going to look for a better product as this one doesn't work on me.,1
2,I purchased the 25 set but I got 9 duplicates one plate I have 3 of them.. Some plates do not transfer image even with Konad polish so that was upsetting and shipping is ridiculous but I guess you get what you pay for.. If you have friends maybe you can buy it together because you most defiantly get duplicates also I emailed them and they only asked for my order number and I never heard from them again...Oh well,1

You must be a hairy man!<br /><br />That may be true... but that's not the point.<br /><br />I purchased 4 of these groomers because each one I purchased failed within 2 weeks.

1,"Bought this from Walgreen a moment back and It did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to stop my acne. If anything, it made my face worse. My acne actually wasn't so bad, i only had a few bumps on my left cheek and a few on my forehead. But after a week of using this, my face darkened, literally about 3 shades darker and being Asian, I was so scared my normal skin wont back and it didn't as long as I was using this. It dried out my lips too and that took a while to heal. It also made my skin even more sensitive to the Sun and when I realised I should stop, things got to the point where I got depressed. More pimples surfaced on my face. All over my forehead and all around my face. I deeply DO NOT recommend the product. Run away.",1
1,"Zeasorb treatment for JOCK ITCH (Amazon Price $9.17) is IDENTICAL to ZEASORB treatment for ATHLETE'S FOOT (Amazon price 2 for $11.18).  The only real difference is the printing on the label.

2,"I had a Rock Band back in the 70's in high school and college, and always liked the longer hair look of the Beatles, Stones, Zeppelin era. Now that I am almost  60, I think I would not mind getting old at all if my hair  would not get any thinner and look as good as Paul M's. lol  I have been using Biolage Hydrating shampoo for 20+ years.  My hair is very fine, and scalp dry, with some dandruff, and started thinning when I was in my early 40's.  I found if I shampooed, used a tiny bit of their conditioner, and rinsed with cool water, then blow dry, my hair looked thicker for most of a day or evening. If I just rinsed with water the next day, it would not blow dry out as full.  Also by washing my hair everyother day it controlled the dandruff.  I am always trying new shampoos when I hear about them, looking for something better than the Biolage.  THAT is why I ordered the Kerastase, after hearing some older ladies at the place where I get my hair cut rave about it.  RESULTS:  I used it for 2 weeks, and gave it to a girlfriend.  After washing and blow drying both with and without conditioner, my hair was NO FULLER than with the Biolage, which is HALF the price.  Also after only a  week of use, my hair and my scalp were dryer, and dandruff more noticable.  IMHO, all the shampoos marketed by these big companies like Loreal, Garnier, Pantene etc. all have the same basic chemicals, they just change the color and perfume, rename it and then launch a huge Ad campaign and sell millions till people realize its the same ol SH**.  I went back to my hydrating shampoo, but with two changes that seem to have helped my volume and thinning.  1. I now use a product to spray or massage onto the ends of my long hair to help protect it from sun damage and split ends during the day,(I am outside playing a lot of golf) and help to gently comb out the tangled split ends without pulling hairs out with my brush after I get out of the shower. I like two products for this so far, the Biolage leave-in-tonic, and another called Biosilk when my split ends are bad. 2. I picked up a Magic Wand massager several months back, on a lark, to try for my tennis elbow.  It does not seem to have had much effect on my tennis elbow, but I discovered it  leaves my scalp tingling after about 5 minutes.  That must help with the blood circulation a little, because my head itches less, and seems less dry.  I also am noticing my hair seems thicker the last few months because I am pulling less of it out when I brush the  split ends with the tonic applied, and also less falling out because of the scalp massaging with the wand.  This makes sense to me because the products using Minoxidil really just dilate the blood vessels.  Hope this helps another old rock-star out there.  :)  leave a comment if you have a similar experience.",1

2,"You'd think that for a wand that costs over a hundred smackers that it would have all the bells and whistles.  The temperature is 410 with no other options.  You don't need temperatures any where near that hot to curl most hair types so variable heat should have been included on this wand.  It should also have a ready light indicator.  It curls nicely, but I'd imagine any product with the same shape could do so.",1

You get SORT of wavy hair (nothing like the face on the box), but is it worth it?  Not for me.",1
2,"This straightener heats super fast but it does not straighten well at all, I had to go over the same strand over and over and it still wouldn't really leave it straight, my hair is naturally wavy but super easy to straighten and i felt like after just one use of this con-air it almost instantly fried the section of the hair i tried to go over.

1,"This did not work for me at all.  I have dark circles and puffiness. The first time I used this product it seemed as if my puffiness under my eyes got worse.  My under eyes looked worse than ever before.  Maybe because I am over 60 and perhaps this is why.  Don't buy.<br />Try anything but this product for puffiness.  It was a total waste of money and they do not offer a guarantee for refunding your money. I will not buy this product again.  Totally disappointed.  I'm still trying their other products such as vitamin C, hydo etc cream after applying vit C.  I see no results whatsoever.  I think my Neutrogena face cream works a lot better than this stuff.",1
1,The jell has a  bad smell when you spray it.,1
1,"This massage oil, although it is supposed to be unscented smells gross. It has a stale smell and isn't very smooth. This made the massage less enjoyable because the oil has a weird feel to it. I enjoy giving and receiving massages but this oil makes the experience not at all enjoyable. The oil leaves the skin feeling greasy even when used sparingly. Without even mentioning how I felt this oil to be, my husband also had the same things to say about it.     Beware!! It also stains fabric and furniture. I never allowed the bottle to spill or get messy and it still managed to stain my furniture leaving yucky rings. What a rip-off!    I do not recommend this massage oil at all!",1

I ordered this for a play my son is in as a prop and after a whopping 5 mins of teaching him how to use a butterfly type knife (comb), one of the rivets popped out, rendering it useless.

1,"Beware when using this product. It turned my natural brown hair a matte black and it barley darkened the gray. My hair looks like it is streaked and not a natural blend of dark gray which I thought I was going to get according to the photo on he box. It is definitely not like the picture on the box. The color is so black immediately when it is applied on your hair(scary!). Id rather use a product that goes on light and gradually darkens slowly, so you can see the darkening process to know when to wash it off. Is there anything like that on the market without peroxide or ammonia?",1

1,Not worth it it dripped onto a favorite shirt. I tried to use it on cotton balls after that. Still nit that well so I got my hair highlighted blond to hide the gray longer... Oh 2 oz. don't go far the way this works. I would say try the marker or the powder with the brush. I also ordered those and they work better.,1
1,wasted money spent on spray water!Bought this bottle without the container to use as a refill- Bottle looks legit with made in France; but this is not the L'ari du Temps i know and love-  Compared with my bottle of eau du parfum and eau de toilette gifts from a retail store- this stuff is worthless!,1
1,"My hair is relatively thin, definitely not thick, but this flat iron definitely did not work very well on my hair. I would have to go over the same spot several times before it actually started to straighten out. That picture on the reviews probably holds true for all of these flat irons-they have at least a 1 mm gap between the plates at one end. The plates are not very good and it doesn't glide along your hair at all, like the coated ceramic plates. If you could spare more space in your bag, you might as well get a full size straightener. Sometimes, they throw in a free mini straightener when you buy a full size one, which is a much better deal. (Also, the color on this straightener is not pretty and pearly like it is in the picture, which was what made me want it in the first place!)",1

1,Don't like it,1
1,"First, I do like Gelish and believe once I get the right color,  starter kit,and UV lamp, I'll be able to give myself long-lasting manis and pedis for a fraction of the cost salons charge. Also, I'm concerned about fungal infections being contracted from the pedicure water spas.  I'm not convinced they can or are cleaned adequately. In the past, I purchased and carried in my own set of utensils.  I'd continue if I could carry in my own foot bath.<br /><br />With regard to this product, the color was not accurately portrayed in the picture. I'm a winter with medium blue base skin tones. This color makes my nails look like yellowed \\""tobacco smokers nails\\"" with a sickly golden base undertone. This would be fine for true red heads, who can wear pumpkin orange, or strawberry blonds, who look great in peach. It would look like a healthy natural color on both of the latter but not on those with blue base undertone skin.  Even though others said to be aware of the color, I did not realize what the problem was. Now I do and will sell mine to purchase a light, natural looking pink.",1
1,Despite the many awesome reviews this product received both on Amazon & various other websites (I do my research before ordering any product) this is not for me. Even used in a super tiny dose this is very greasy. Made me break out horribly in almost cystic-type bumps. I tried using this religiously for about 3 months straight (since all products take time) and saw no result in fading dark spots/acne scars on my face. I stopped using because it wasn't worth the breakouts I was getting from it. If I was trying to fade a scar elsewhere on my body I may pull this back out of the closet and give it a try--however this product will get no where near my face ever again. I'll pay more next time for a better quality product that will actually show results.,1
2,This color was great for the first three months but then it changed to a much lighter shade of purple.  Something I've Never had happen with OPI nail polish before.  I was really disappointed because I really loved the color I purchased.  I've been buying OPI for years and have always been happy with how well the polish holds up and how nice the colors our.  I think this must have been a fluke.  Debi B.,1

This bottle needs two hands, but then you cannot use the spray nozzle at the top. To make matters worse, the bottle is smooth, and after a shower, it collects condensation, making as slippery as a fish. And the bottle is immense. I end up resting it on my chest to hold the bottle with one hand, use my chest for support, and squirt using my other hand.<br />...all the while cursing the bottle, the designer, the contents, the company, and my stupid decision to purchase this.<br /><br />I should just trash the bottle and reduce my morning stress.",1

Each brush head in the past that I have purchased has lasted for the recommended 3 month change period without any issues.  But, with the brush heads I purchased from the seller &#34;GOODTIMETOBY&#34;, I noticed when I put the brush head on, it didn't &#34;lock&#34; into place like all the prior ones had.  And, after using it for the first time, the bristles looked rather frayed...  Just 5 days later, I had to change the brush head because the bristles became VERY frayed.  They were so frayed the whole brush head was compacted down and looked almost melted.  So, I tried the second brush head in the pack and it did the exact same thing.  In fact, on the second brush head, the metal ring fell off after a couple days use.  These are OBVIOUSLY counterfeit items.  The performance is abysmal compared to the prior brushes I have purchased  And, the worst part is that I purchased 2 packs of these at once, so I am now out $36.50!

Oddly, it was in an area adjacent to the application of the hair removing product where the cream wasn't directly applied. It doesn't have a strong smell at all and removes hair as effectively as other facial hair removal products (that is, sufficiently but not perfectly). If it was competitively priced to other products, I would purchase it again just to avoid the nasty smell of other products. However, I don't think the extra expense is justified.",2

3.0,It does smell very nice. Very calming and fresh. Didn't like the taste,2
3,"I found this product to be okay, but nothing I would purchase again. First, the smell is not very appealing to me. I would have preferred something more natural smelling. Second, I never got that real lasting clean feeling from this product and it made me feel like I needed to wash my hair more often. Overall, it is not a bad product just not something I would purchase again.",2
3,"I'm not sure how I feel about this product. I expect &#34;paste&#34; to be thicker; this runs thin. It doesn't foam like toothpaste normally does and I didn't feel it gave me the same clean. As an experiment it was used after one of Tom's toothpaste but still didn't feel like it made anymore difference than a wet toothbrush. (A second brushing is usually beneficial for me.) Since the item is open, money spent, and the flavor is not objectionable I still feel compelled to keep using it for the purported health benefits.",2
3,I liked this on vacation but the brush is too small and the power isn't the level I like with my home electric toothbrush but I made due while on vacation.<br /><br />LS,2
3,"These would probably work with thick hair.  They are hard plastic, and don't bend very well, so it didn't work to make a bun with my thin hair even if it is pretty long.",2

3,"Don't get me wrong: I love this scent by Davidoff, and I am a total fragrance snob. I was absolutely ecstatic when I first sniffed it at a department store counter. <br /> <br />However, I am disappointed by its longevity. I know fragrances work differently with everyone's body chemistry, but Cool Water does not last on me. After two hours, it's like I didn't use any perfume. <br /> <br />Hopefully it will work better for you. I'm looking for something else.",2
3,"It's okay but not really well made, not too sturdy. Works okay, just don't try to pick up any think too heavy. It didn't work when I first rec'd it. Had to snap the mechanism into place down by the grabber, then it work okay.",2
3,"So here's the deal with this stuff. It smells good, almost like a xmas tree. It's green and thick and soapy, lathers and rinses well. Conditions your skin a bit. Fragrance doesn't linger long, maybe an hour after you're dried. People like the smell. Doesn't clean all that well - stinky armpits despite two scrubbings is an indication it doesn't clean well - and it clogs my pores. If I use it more than 2 or 3 days in a row, I start getting those annoying random pimples that are caused by comedogenic skin care products.<br /><br />If you and those around you like the smell of christmas trees, then I'd get this as a special occasion/ occasional body wash.",2
3,"i like this product, made my legs really shiny and soft. but it has an odd smell. like noodles or something.. i know it's weird. i don't care for it.",2
3,I love the smell. But it does not last. Too expensive to keep reapplying. Maybe the parfum is a better product.,2
3,"It was alright, nothing special.  They should pack a full size lip balm.  It was dumb what they sent. I wouldn't order this again",2
3.0,"I have oily skin so this is not the best cream for me. It made my slin more oily. I thought maybe it will be like this in the beginning until my skin adjust to it, but after I ordered the second one, the oiliness didn't go away. I think it's better for dry skin.",2
3,"Just learned that the aluminum compounds in anti-perspirants is what is responsible for those impossible &#34;pit stains&#34; in white shirts.

Otherwise, get the deodorant.",2

3,"I bought this machine from Shining Image around 5 months ago and wanted to give myself proper time to write an accurate review. The first machine I received was defective and didn't work so they sent me another one.<br />The machine comes with a small instruction manual that you must read in order to get started. However, you either need to be in the industry and already know the machine to use it as intended because the instruction manual is missing valuable information and not that well written.<br />The microdermabrasion function is fairly straight forward. I have used it about 10 times and my skin feels smooth afterwards so I am fairly happy with that. However, I have no clue on when the head needs to be replaced on the machine. I am assuming the diamond tip doesn't last forever and would love to know how you know when to replace. It comes with several tips.<br />I have noticed no difference in the skin scrubber or ultrasound functions. The ultrasound function is missing the description in the instruction manual on its function so I am not even sure what it is supposed to be doing. Also fails to give you indications on how long you should use it and how often so that is why possibly I am not noticing any difference here.<br />It is fairly disappointing that I paid more to get these functions and there are not enough instructions on how to really use them efficiently. I tried contacting the company shining image about this they didn't respond or give me any leads on how I would get this information. They did tell me to 'youtube' it at one point but even youtube doesn't have any instructions on this machine or these functions. Frustrating they would refer me to something that doesn't exist.<br />I would save your money and not buy this particular machine if you don't know these functions already. If anyone does know more I would appreciate their review!",2
3,"It's alright for a double eyelid glue. It holds on fine, but not for an extra long time--maybe 3 hrs? The only thing I absolutely hate about it is that it's super hard to remove. I tried water, soap, makeup remover, but it still won't come off. You can't even peel it off, too. You have to scratch and rub it off and it hurts your eyelids. Plus, it turns a dark color the next day so it's very noticeable. My advice is probably get Eyetalk rather than Darkness because it's easier to remove.",2
3,Fit extremely small and the color was very yellow :/,2
3,"Online the item looked and says pink but when i received it, it is more red than anything. Other than that it has been a good product.<br />Thank you",2
3,"They do not last very long, you have to keep on changing them and they are a little bit pricey.",2
3,"I got a pair of these hoping that by \\""large\\"" they meant wide because I have a hard time finding wide, cheap glasses to fit my broad face.  These aren't wide.  Beware.  Other than that, they're fine.",2
3,Seems to be lathering fine but not as easily as my cheap badger one. The brush has more backbone than my tweezerman boar. No bad smell or bristle loss. Seems like a quality handle and secure knot.,2
3,"The waxing function with this honey wax is good. However, the honey is extremely hard to be removed, even with body oil. If you could mess up easily during waxing like me, I suggest you go with Sugar wax instead of this one.",2
3.0,"Sure, these heads provide a decent shave and breathe new life into your aging Norelco shaver.  But when it's cheaper to get a brand new Panasonic ES-RT51-S 3 Blade Electric Razor Wet/Dry with Flexible Pivoting Head for $54.28 - Then these replacement heads aren't something to get excited about.",2
3,"Recieved this product as a trial... I thought It was good for the most part for whitening however though, I felt it didn't freshen the mouth as well as other toothpastes. I would use this product again however for a special occasion.",2
3,"My sister had this spray which is why decided to get it.  She smelled so good, I couldn't get enough.  For whatever reason mine smells more like Nag Champ and less like the light sweet fragrance she was wearing.  So, I would say, for some, you'll love it and others maybe not so much.  You just have to try it to find out.  Luckily, it's not that expensive, so perhaps worth a try.",2
3,"I read a lot of different reviews before deciding on this trimmer. I liked the recharge/wet-dry/and length adjustment options and Remington is a good name. Except now. :-( It did a good job upon purchase. Comes nicely packaged with accessories too. No nicks or pinches - didn't try to go super fast though! You might have to make a couple of passes for the length you want as another reviewer mentioned but that's fine.<br />Now the downside. After the first time it ran down (I let it run the whole way down as directions suggest for rechargeable batteries), it never quite worked right again. The motor on full recharge would sort of rrr-rrrrrr-rr like a car that had trouble starting. I continued to use it and would recharge it when it ran all the way down but eventually after about six months the motor wasn't running consistently enough with enough charge to operate smoothly. And you don't want a rr-rr-rr-rrrrrrrrrr-r jump when you are dealing delicate! Also, the plastic length change piece broke after about three uses...and they would expect you would be taking it off and on fairly regularly to clean it.<br />If this had been a cheap $4 piece of junk at the discount mart I would have shrugged. But it was an expensive shaver from a well known company and I was disappointed in its cheap manufacturing for the price. Guess another company bites the dust - outsources to save money but loses in the end on the cheap manufacturing with a high retail cost. I don't want remington's execs getting fat on my loss. This shaver takes about three hours wages to buy for me currently and I expected it to last at least a few years.",2
3.0,Great Thickness and Color with a Great Price Too!!! Everybody will Love it!,2
3,"I wear size 11 to 11 1/2 women's shoes.  It is impossible to put my foot in the wax without my toes scraping the end.  I have to kind of dip my heels then my toes.  It's a pain in the rear, but it works.<br /><br />With all paraffin wax baths, you have to deal with melting time, etc.  I don't mind the time issues with this product, it just comes with the territory.<br /><br />One downside of the well is the plastic guard that sets atop of the heating element.  If you get a finger/toe past the guard, it's scorching hot.  I think the holes should be a bit smaller to protect the skin.<br /><br />Overall, the price is right and it works.  I would recommend it, but if you have the money, get the professional kind!<br /><br />One issue I had with packaging is that the directions were enclosed in a plastic wrap, open at one end.  I don't know if it had been returned or if the manufacturer poorly planned this, but the oils from the paraffin bars leaked into the bag and ruined the directions.  I could BARELY read them.  The packaging of the paraffin bars is atrocious.  Revlon should be ashamed of their half-hearted attempt to package the wax.  It truly made the whole product oily.  Not appealing when you open the box.",2
3,3 stars because unless you apply it perfectly on and take your time it's clump at stick your lashes together! It took me about 3 times to get it to go on right. Nothing like the 40 dollar American made one I just ordered that one goes on nice and smooth no mess.,2

3,Nice product,2
3,Smells watered down.,2
3,"I haven't used sugar scrubs before, I am used to salt scrubs and have to say I prefer the salt.  The scent is good, it is uplifting and leaves your skin feeling good.  This came in a 3 pack, so I have given one as a gift and it was well received.  These can be quite expensive in local stores, so this was a good price.  If you enjoy sugar scrubs, you would definitely like this--I just prefer the salt scrubs.",2
3,"Very dark ,it does not work for me I have to buying lighter",2

3,Just used the razor and loved it. the handle is very comfortable however the power button placement could be improved by being on the bottom of the razor. I shave my head and was worried that I would hit the power button when shaving the top of my head since I was holding the razor upside down. For normal use on your face it was great.,2
3,"Over the last few years, I've used several different strip products for teeth whitening.  They all work.  You pay for speed (5 days costs more than 7 days, for example)...but they all work and are relatively easy to use and make minimal mess.  Also, these days, most products are ONCE PER DAY use.<br /><br />Prime Time Smile recommends TWICE PER DAY...right there, it's a less exciting product for me.  Mornings are tough for me as it is, and remembering to apply this product is a challenge.  But the main reason I have to dock this system a couple of stars is that it is a pain to on and a bit messy.  It is no comparison to the ease of strips, in my opinion.  You have to brush on two different gels onto your teeth, and the stuff gets bit gloppy.  It then fizzed in your mouth, and for me, it also dried out my gums.  Dessicated them!  I felt like I was swallowing the stuff the whole 30 minutes I had it on.  For me, the system is just not as easy or efficient...thus, I will not use it again.<br /><br />It DOES whiten teeth.  I'll give it that.  Just as well as 5-7 day strips THAT YOU USE ONCE PER DAY.  Also, you could theoretically whiten more teeth...because you're not constrained by strips, you could coat all your teeth if you wanted to, I reckon.  For some, that might be a plus that makes this worthwhile.",2
3,"My husband and I have been using this now for about a month and we are okay with it. The power of the water is not great and I always doubt it is doing as good a job as regular dental floss, so often I just use both to be sure.<br /><br />The amount of water held is a little skimpy but this I can deal with by refilling the tank. I like that it is cordless and that makes it really easy to share since we have separate sinks.<br /><br />The price was right and for dental implants this was recommended by the dentist so I hope it is doing the job!",2
3,"so i ordered this product in march from the united states . I got it April 26th<br />i opened it with high expectations .<br />the extension is gorgeous ! - but just a tad shiny. Not enough to be a problem for me but it may bother others.  (ive read rubbing baby powder into the extension will take care of that )but unless your hair is a white-ish- blond , do not order this product!<br />it looks nearly real  (not to mention sooo soft!/ amazing ) but because of my hair color i cannot use it.<br />if you live in the east area of the united states it should take about a month to get here.<br />its also curled very well but dose not curl to the top. This keeps it from looking like there would be gaps and keeps it more realistic looking .<br />my hair is a strawberry blond and can just go behind my shoulders . so putting on this extension was hard to get on and painful to get off .<br />if your hair is longer then mine and a white-ish blond this could be great for you .",2

3,"I have been using these brushes since 2000. My first one lasted 7 years and it was by far the simplest design and the best. Since my original one died I am now on my 3rd one, yup 3 newer Sonicares in the last 5 years. They still work great but there are 2 major flaws with them. First the new blue bristles that tell you when its time to change the brush head, mine always loses its blue in about 6 - 8 weeks, a far cry from the original brush head which lasted for 3 months. The brush is never even used up in 6-8 weeks you can feel the difference when its time to change the head. So ignore the blue. But my biggest complaint is the new design of the head. They used to make the head so the hard plastic case screwed onto the brush holder, which sealed out most of the toothpaste fallout from your mouth, which was a decent design. Now they make them so you just push them onto the base. My problem with this is that you get build up of nasty gook under the base, unless you are like me and remove the brush and rinse and dry it after each use. Even if you do, which I do, there is still a mold issue at the base where the white rubber seal encloses the metal tip. No mater how well I dry it or the fact that I wipe it clean after every use there is still a bit of mold that starts developing along the white rubber seal in the crevice. This bothers me to no end. There should not be mold or any sort of black build up especially if I am rinsing and drying it all the time. I started doing this with my newest one to see if the problem still happened and yes it does. So whereas I love the way my teeth feel when I am done brushing and I won't switch back to a traditional brush I find the new design to be a major flaw and a big profit for Phillips. I am convinced they changed the design of the brush head so they can make more money by selling more heads sooner then necessary, but don't buy into it, that new head should last for at least 3 months even if that blue is gone. The mold is another issue.issue.",2
3,"this prefume was ok,its too heavy for me,its more suitable for man.i advice spray it on yours clothes 10minute before you clothing on,its smell become soft.seller service fast and good.",2
3,"I should admit something before I say anything else. I'm not the target demographic for this product. My face doesn't need some special facewash to keep me from breaking out or clean my pores. But, it was free, so I gladly accepted it.<br /><br />After finishing the bottle recently I stepped back and really looked at my skin and I really didn't see much difference. Don't get me wrong, I didn't have any blemishes or anything, but I'm not saying that's due to this product...I'm not saying it isn't either though.<br /><br />You see, I'm totally indifferent. I can't say it works because I really didn't need it, but I can't say it doesn't work for that exact same reason. So I'll offer this, my face did feel cleaner after using it. If you feel like you need a product like this, give it a shot. Everyone's skin is different. What works for you might not work for solmeone else, likewise for the other person. It's all about finding what suits you best.",2

3,"Seriously doubt the claims that it is Tourmaline, Ionic and Ceramic.  There is not switch for Ionic (as described) and the nozzle is at sort of an odd angle from the handle, not 90 degrees like most hairdryers.  The photo makes it look as if it is but it's more like 80 degrees, which makes awkward to direct it at your hair in some positions when using a round brush.

3,This sunscreen is fine as far as effectiveness goes and I really like that it is organic and relatively safe--however the smell is strong and offensive to me. It smells like really flowery perfume that an elderly woman might wear too much of (which is why I only give it 3 stars). My face also burns after a really intense (read: sweaty) workout when I'm wearing it. Unfortunately I will be looking for another sunscreen once I use this one up due to the smell.,2
3,"The Aveeno Creamy Oil moisturizer is an OK product but I think that it is wet/watery feeling on the skin when first applied and a bit runny to me. Aveeno should make a much much thicker, creamier version of this product that is not light w/a stronger almond oil scent that stays on drier/flaky skin 10x's better, because after a while the creamy oil just dries up feeling like I put nothing on and have to constantly reapply. I like it but it needs a stronger formulation. I hope they make a thick cream of this though.",2

Overall not a bad eye cream, just not worth the high price..I buy this for much cheaper on Ebay so I save money, for $28-32 a tube I say no way to this, but for $12-15 for a tube of this on Ebay I say game on...",2
3,I got this and I was expecting it took look like it did in the picture and it didn't. The color was a very light brown and was expecting a darker color.

3,"I don't know what happened with this product, but it is very different from the formula I've used for over a year. This serum has left my face and neck with an itchy, blotchy rash. I believe this product was packaged for the Canadian market, evidenced by the English description, along with a French description. I can't say if L'Oreal has 2 different formulas, or if the original is different; all I know is that this product is not the same and, for me, it is unusable.    7/16/2011 After my skin cleared, I re-tried a small amount on my face, avoiding my eyelids and neck. It seems to be fine as long as I avoid the more vulnerable skin. The reason I tried this product again is because it feels and smells the same as the serum I was using before. It simply doesn't make sense to have such a bad reaction from something that has worked well before.     This formula works very well on my forehead and sides of my face, but I won't try it on my eyelids again and my neck still hasn't recovered completely.",2

3,"I own many safety razors, some fairly expensive, and some really cheap. This is a cheap razor that gives a decent shave.

The knurling on the handle is uneven, and feels rough. The chrome plating on the head had imperfections too. The handle is aluminum, which makes the razor \\""head heavy.\\"" Not a bad thing.

3,I was hoping for a better quality. These tweezers get most of my unwanted eyebrow hairs out but not the small ones. Not as sharp and accurate as the high end tweezers from sephora.,2
3,"This product works okay, but I found a deodarent that works better.",2
3,"I ordered with the intention of growing my hair longer and stronger. Firstly, I believe that the kit is offered at a pretty decent price seeing that the oils are all natural.  My favorite oil out of the two would be the lighter version, hence I use that one everyday just about. The ligh ter version had a faint peppermint smell opposed to the other one, which  honestly....stinks to me. I only use the heavy version for deep treatments, because it smells that bad to me. I would never put the heavy version in my hair to wearoutside. If yelpyou buy this product for the intention of growing your hair long, I'd say go ahead and purchase it to add in your arsenal....if you follow the exact instructions....which advise you to not use that much....this may be a decent product for you. I however, will only purchase the  lighter version next though; since I am pretty much out of that one. The full strength version....ill have for a long long time.",2
3,"The products are perfect, but it took a month and a half to receive the products. However, I am quite happy with the condition and quality.",2
3,Smells good but does not last more than 4 hrs...,2
3,"This is a good manniken except I expected the hair to be thicker, I quickly got over that tho. The hair is in fact WELL layered at the tips, worth the money :]",2
3,"No complaints on functionality but it is WAY bigger and heavier then I expected based on my previous cord-keeper folding handle Conair.  I supose I should have paid more attention to the size specs before ordering but I guess I assumed a style that folds up would be space conscious all the way around.  If you own a seperate hair dryer for travel, this could be a good option.  I think it would be best for the teen age crowd, it is awfuly pink too.",2
3,"I bought my Zeno Mini in 2009. It stopped working properly around 2011. It just wouldn't power on or stay on despite installing new batteries or a new tip. And Zeno stopped making them so you can't buy them in store anymore. I gave in and bought the new Zeno Hot Spot.  So far, it's a weird device. The design is strange. There's no button to turn it off, or even on for that matter. You have to press your finger against the \\""on\\"" area until it beeps and the lights light up. This isn't good if you accidentally touch the \\""on\\"" spot and don't need to use it at that moment. This needs to be remedied by the manufacturer.  Also, it doesn't heat up nearly as much as the Mini. Sometimes it feels like the Hot Spot isn't even hot. I guess they wanted this to be more gentle.  There have been a lot of complaints about the batteries. Well, I buy packs of AAs from Dollar Tree. Usually, one cycle uses a pair of batteries. Maybe I'd get more cycles if I bought \\""legit\\"" AAs from major markets. I've had my Hot Spot for at least a few months and it's always worked since then. No problems.  The treatment quality varies. I've been getting those bad cystic zits (not acne, just a random pimple) that are kind of hard and definitely not coming to a head anytime soon. They also hurt and can't be popped. So, I try to use my Zeno to \\""shrink\\"" the pimple. This requires a lot of cycles and a lot of cheapo batteries. If I did this with the Mini, my skin would be super red and possibly \\""burnt\\"". I guess I'd rather deal with redness than a gross and painful zit.  So, the Mini was more effective and just simply superior all around. The Hot Spot is a mediocre replacement that sometimes gets the job done. I wish these had tip replacements and or a better button. I think I'll be buying a Mini off eBay soon. Zeno needs to resurrect that one and get rid of the Hot Spot.",2
3,Takes a couple go's to get into skin very dark. decent when turned into a graywash. Okay i guess. Seller is A++,2
3,My daughter loved them however in 1 day 2 lashes broke. Cute but not made good at all & 1 stone was missing,2
3,"A bit over the top for my tastes, but customers may really like them for private viewing. Remains to be seen",2
3.0,"Although I like these hair ditties, they don't seem to be tight enough.  They do retain their shape though.  After stretching out they revert back to their original size (not immediately, but eventually)",2
3,"Gel II Reaction Color Changing Mood Nail Polish worked okay, but kept pulling back at the tips",2
3,This is a good nude lip butter/ balm. It's good for people who have heavily pigmented lips and goes on clear. It has no artificial fragrance and has a nice texture on the lip. The color lasts a long time (if you don't eat anything) and is office/ school appropriate.<br />I own this product in multiple colors. Feel free to ask any questions and/ or leave comments.<br />Thanks,2
3,"Scent (2 stars): this lotion smells great in the bottle and light on the skin.<br /><br />Texture (3 stars): silicone based, went in thin and disappeared leaving my skin very soft.  I prefer a thicker lotion to this one such as Conceited.<br /><br />Color (5 stars): I became definitely darker with just one packet. A crisp, definitive line around the sticker and still there hours later. Impressive.<br /><br />ATO (1 star): (this was the deal breaker) the ATO of this lotion as soon as I got out of the bed was TERRIBLE. I will not buy a bottle of this lotion based solely on that.<br /><br />Overall (3 stars): great lotion for color that made me much darker, but not thick enough or pretty smelling enough.  I would use another packet of this lotion if I thought I was hitting a tan wall.",2
3,"Very beautiful color, but you NEED a top coat to make it shimmer and show the multi faceted glitter tones. I prefer my Sally Hansen &#34;Red Carpet&#34; over this, nearly identical and you don't need a top coat, plus its easier to remove than Nubar.",2
3,"Bristles are too stiff.  Hopefully they will soften over time, but right now they are painful.",2
3,"I didn't know that this product contains No AHA. I thought I was buying AHA night cream until the package arrived with that information on the box. It is a nice cream, but I wanted AHA to work on my skin over night.",2
3,Made my hair extremely greasy even with just a little use.,2
3,Love the smell cleans my hair but the itchy flaky is still there.  Disappointing after all the reviews I read,2
3,"I was disappointed in the fragrance, I was expecting it to smell like cocoa butter, that's why I bought it, but it doesn't. The fragrance is not offensive but not what I had wanted. Aside from that it's a nice night cream for the price.",2
3,This cloth is amazing until you wash it a few times and all of a sudden you are washing your face with a big black mold cloth. They are great and do what they say but you have to buy a new one after about a month or so.,2
3,Daughter didn't like shape of brush.,2
3,"Battery life not very good, does the job, but you ave to go over and over the same spots and will lose it's charge in the middle of a cutting.",2
3,I haven't ever tried any other &#34;serums&#34; so I am not sure if they are all similar but the scent of this serum was a little too much for me.  It smelled like vitamins.,2
3,"I just dont feel anything, used couple times",2
3,Delivery took a bit too long on this one,2
3,Pretty good brush. I had read other reviews about the bristles falling out. This has not happened to me. I really do like this brush. Gives a flawless look.,2
3,OK,2
3,"Before I purchased this, I had the exact same one with the light, clean scent. Unfortunately, I have to say that I liked the one with the scent better because I felt that it was a better moisturizer and left you smelling clean but not overally perfumed. This product, I feel, lacks the amount of moisture I need, that was in the scented one, as my face still feels dry many times. I love Olay products but I would probably purchase the lightly scented one once this one is finished.",2
3,Works well but effects don't last very long. The taste is a little strange as well. I still recommend trying it .,2
3.0,"Get what you expected, delivery a little late",2
3,Smaller than I thought they would be.,2
3,Its dark and muddy and sure doesn't look like sun on fair skin. I gave some stars because it may be ok for skin that is not fair.,2
3,"first purchase was gret, this seems to be something different...",2
3,Too expensive,2
3,"this product i think is ok but i doesnt  like it coz , its open  they doesnt sealed the color<br />i think they used it or what ?<br />plus this product is it look really watery",2
3,"The clip is so pretty, but the clip itself is flimsy.  I can't get it to clip anything - I think as long as it is just used for decoration (instead of hair retaining!) it would be fine",2
3.0,"I bought this to replace an ancient WaterPik which finally died.  I was thinking that since the Oral Irrigator was self-contained, it would be easier to use.  It isn't.  It does, however, do basically what it is purported to do.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Does blow out debris between teeth<br />Not tethered to the wall or base unit<br />Rechargeable<br /><br />Cons:<br />Bulky, cumbersome, but you eventually get used to it.<br />Only two pressure settings (the 'high' setting NOT recommended for beginners; can hurt gums and soft tissue.)<br />Flashing blue light, while recharging, can be annoying if kept in bathroom attached to bedroom and door is left open.<br /><br />Should I need to replace this unit, I probably look for a different product.",2
3,"Too white, even using a little, I looked dead, could be its too light for my skin.",2
3,"It's a little greasy and doesn't have the best smell, but it's super moisturizing!",2
3,"I expected more from this conditioner because I love S Factor products.  I didn't find that my hair was any more conditioned than when using any other conditioner.  For the price, I can't say it was worth it.  I wouldn't buy it again.",2
3,"I have aging color treated hair, that fades way more rapidly than I'd like. So I thought I'd try this shampoo, since my hair is the kind it targets. I have used it twice so far. It smells wonderful, as another reviewer wrote. It has a luxurious, silky feel, and lathers nicely. Still, this shampoo makes MY hair feel TOO soft. That may be because I have fine hair that is still oily, even at my age.  Anyhow, if this shampoo is color-safe enough for me to use it daily, then it will work. I'll just have to try it and see...  UPDATE: I have now tried this shampoo for daily use. I have had more things planned than usual on the calendar lately, and didn't want to do my usual routine of good hair day/bad hair day (when I shampoo every OTHER day). So I've used this shampoo daily for several days now. While it's not as cleansing as my usual shampoo(s), it does make my hair feel cleaner than it would on my &#34;off&#34; day of my every-other-day regimen. AND it just seems to work better now than when I first tried (and reviewed) it Am getting more volume as I use it. Will continue to use it, and see what happens over time.  PS - also, this shampoo does give my hair more shine than other shampoos. (My current color has its good points, but vibrancy isn't one of them).",2
3,"Work fine, a little softer than I expected. They tend to bend easily. I think next time I will order something a little more stiff.",2
3,This did keep my underarms fairly smooth. Compared to cheaper brands of solid deodorants though like suave I did not experience a very big difference though. Not really worth the extra money for me personally.,2
3,I wish they came in more colors :) yellow black and etc :) their adorable I love them!,2
3,I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and have yet to notice any change to my face. It feels good on and no dryness so that is nice but no overall changes.,2
3,Does not like atall. It's smell is not that good which I accepted. Not happy. Bath and body works are much better creams . I waisted my money.,2
3,"This product is  not what I thought it would be.  Its not  red, and it has a wax feel on my lips.  it stings like alcohol is in it and I wasn't to pleased with it.",2
3,This brush is wonderful. It applies the makeup smoothly. The other brushes I had before did not do as great of a job,2
3,Love this soap but the Peppermint is probably not the best for washing your body...and certain areas.  I prefer the orange oil for the shower.,2
3,"My daughter has thin straight hair and would probably be better off using a smaller barrel to make tighter curls.  Her curls don't last very long.  Also the on/off button never worked so I have to plug it in and then unplug it when I'm done.  For people with thicker hair with some body, this product would probably be just fine.",2
3,I read other reviews for this product and decided to buy it. I have thick hair but I've dyed it dark and light a few times so a good portion of my hair is a little damaged. When I use the shampoo and conditioner every day without any other product it makes my hair feel greasy and oily. It's smooth but I have to wash it the next day or it feels very gross.,2
3,The trimmer attachment works very well. The foil shaver attachment is just ok. The charger doesn't fit snugly into the razor. I actually have to tape it in a certain way to get it to connect and charge.,2
3,"Frustration free in this case means that the brush heads come each inside a little plastic bag instead of the previous near bullet-proof hard plastic encasing.<br /><br />There are 3 Sonicare users in our household so, when it comes to ordering replacement brush heads, naturally, we seek the 'family supersize' offer hoping to save a few dollars. As far as I know, this is the largest pack you can get at Amazon - the 4-pack hasn't been available since almost forever.<br /><br />Needless to say, but I know I'm preaching to the converted because anyone looking for this item should be a Sonicare user already, 10 years of Sonicare meant lots of money saved in dentist bills and a better quality of life for me. But... you've GOT to replace those brush heads because they DO wear out. It's only my impression and I may be wrong but my impression is that the current brush heads tend not to last as long as the ones we were getting 50+ years ago.<br /><br />Compatible with the following Sonicare models:<br /><br />e3000 - Xtreme<br />a4000 - advance<br />e5000 - essence<br />e7000 - elite<br />e9000 - elite",2
3,"Feels like a real facial sauna, but you have to have the time to sit with a towel over your head, which means you can't read or watch TV for the few minutes you are supposed to allow. I used it a lot at first, ut now it is just sitting on a storage shelf.f.",2
3,Let's face it this epilator is pricier than some of our other options. I went for it because of the built-in light and because the tweezer count is (40) on the high end.  I bought it to replace my lost two-year old Panasonic ES-WD51-P which has 48 tweezers and I do believe is faster at removing hair than this one. The light is useful to have although it's not angled well for use while you're running the epilator. But it is handy to check if you've missed any spots with. Is the light feature worth an additional $20-$30? Probably not.,2
3,"I wouldn't recommend it if you have long hair, but it works well for my daughter since her hair is not so thick.",2
3,smells good but does not seem help skin,2
3,"This hair dresser's oil is light and a small amount to the middle and ends of my hair does a good job of protecting it, though there are argan oils that work just as well and are not as pricey. The .07 size is a small vial (generally free with purchases from Bumble and Bumble direct) and is exactly what it says; a sample.",2
3,The hair was fine but the way it was sewn in showed short hairs sticking up.,2
3,makes my face soft but I wasn't completely impressed. I agree with another reviewer i saw on here. I can't tell if its really dead skin coming off or the spray drying and rubbing off in clumps. I notice if I spray more on my face then i should (by accident) i rub and nothing happens. Its only when i spray barely enough where it kinda dries when I see the &#34;dead skin&#34;. I only gave it a 3 because its organic.,2
3,"However, you have to use a good shampoo and conditioner when washing the hair, otherwise, it is difficult do wash the hair, it feels kind of dry and sticky.  I have normal hair.  I use shampoo that is organic and is for color treated hair.  If you use shampoo over the counter, it doesn't work too well.  I know this hair color product is supposed to be all natural, but the ingredient makes the hair feels kind of strange.  At least that's my experience so far, after use the product twice already.  Other than that, this product works for me.",2
3,Have not used it yet but did NOT get this model with the handle and cord wrap base which I wanted.  I instead got the one that is squat and round with no handle & no place to wrap cord.  Such a bummer.  Also the lid does not lock onto the one I received.  I'm sad I didn't get the one I wanted.<br /><br />Will rate performance after I use it.,2
3,"I does its job, i guess, but the bristles clump together. It's not the best i could ask for, but I'm not going to go out and get a different one.",2
3,"I use this when I watch tv.  This gentle peel doesn't work for tough callus, good for very smooth heal just for maintenance.",2
3,"It's hard for me to rate this product. When it arrived, the plastic cap was off and the nozzle was broken, so the can wouldn't dispense any foam. I contacted the seller and he elected to give me a refund, rather than send me another can. Thus, the reason for three stars.",2
3,For this price I was expecting a lot more make-up. Each spot on this plastic tray is very shallow. Doesn't give you much make-up. Difficult to get to the colors in the rear of each tray. You have to pull out each tray and then force it back in again.<br />The container is nice.<br />I won't be buying something like this again.,2
3,Don't get these if you have natural nails. The tough grit and shape caused my nail beds and side skin to bleed and it didn't file smoothly it left scalloped edges.,2
3.0,"Godefroy's eyelash tint works as promised, but it was difficult to use.  The eye shield did not stay in place.  I used the little dental braces brush recommended by other users, but kept poking myself in the eye.  So, while I did get pretty good results, my eyes were red and sore for more than a day.  Maybe it just takes more practice?",2
3,Not shaped right for my face but they work better than no eye protection.,2
3.0,"This was my first EXPENSIVE toothbrush purchase... While it does make my teeth whiter and clean, I stopped using it due to the fact that it irritates my teeth when using it. I have sensitive teeth and so the rotating head and vibrations due Nothing to help it. I don't use it anymore because of the pain BUT I do like the little timer and smiley detector that tells you how well you brush your teeth. And all the parts work perfectly, I even use it in the shower. (Conserve water people)<br />If you don't have sensitive teeth this will probably be a life changing tooth brush.",2
3,"It gives my skin a spa-like feel, doesn't clog pores, and has a nice smell. However, I have combination skin and this actually dried out my skin. I think this would be great for people with oily skin, or it could be an excellent light moisturizer for the summer. However, living in the Midwest it's felt like Fall since late August. I've always used lotions, and I thought this gel-cream would give my skin that extra boost, but sadly no.",2
3,"Facial primer, like all e.l.f products is wonderful, however: the application top is defective and I was only able to use it twice.  Product otherwise is absolutely wonderful.  In fact, I ended up re-ordering Face Primer I loved it so much.",2
3,thats right and people need to know they probably will not recieve this item in time!  How can you give it 5 stars if you don't even have the item ?,2
3,I like it ok.  It does help pouf up my hair a bit.  You only need to use a tiny amount.  Use too much and your hair looks dull and feels icky.  I probably won't buy it again.,2
3,"this brush isnt the best, i would save my money to buy a better one , but it will do for now i guess",2
3,It is too orange for my coloring.  Other than that it is okay.,2
3,"This mascara is okay if you are looking to just have some on, but it does clump a bit. The first time I wore it I had to take it off and reapply it.",2
3,The product has nice packaging but the smell is awful and I always wonder if others can smell it when I periodically have to use this product.,2
3,"I've bought a bottle of this body wash about a week ago from Macy's and used it 4 times. I knew the fragrance for years so decided to pony-up $18 plus tax and give a body wash a try. Smells like the fragrance sprays but when you wash off the gel, the scent goes away. For $18 Kielh's could have formulated it a bit better with longer-lasting projection [like Old Spice does for 1/4 of the price of Kiehl's]. Its good, but it can be better and probably can also cost less. I bet that some manufacturer can knock-off the musk scents and stam-out much cheaper products than Kiehl's.",2
3,Smells great,2
3,"They are barrettes.  I do not like the thickness of them.  I have to have color matched hair clips if i wear them, and these tend to stick out more because of the thickness.  Wanting to try something different with these, but I will stick to the Goody color collection contour clips from now on.",2
3,"Overall, I was satisfied with my purchase from Nail Etc. The polish I received looked exactly as pictured on the site. I was also impressed with the price. Typically, OPI nail polishes are more expensive than they were here, especially if purchased directly from the OPI site. I would definitely purchase from this seller again. I loved their wide variety of colors to choose from.",2
3,There ok a little firm but works,2
3,"These really aren't that great, but they work.  The pads are kind of hinky.",2
3,"Love the concept as I travel quite a bit. However, it does not fit most dryers so I am not able to use as often as I would like.",2
3,"Either the product was defective, or mail packaging wasn't adequate, but the spring in the brush broke at the second use. I expected this things to last more than that.",2
3,This feather does not stay in  your hair. It will fall out all day. It looked pretty in the package though.,2
3,OK shampoo.  Have used better brands.,2
3,"I saw the reviews of how great this stuff was and I just found that it really didn't do anything spectacular, any more than any other product.",2
3,"I didn't want to review this until I had used it a least 2 months, the recommended time to see results.  I have now used it for 3 months and I swear there is no improvement.  I am not fat at all.  5'4&#34; and 120 lbs. I'm 43, mother of 2 teens, I work out 3 days a week and eat good.  I do have minimal to average cellulite on my thighs.  I used this product twice a day for 3 months.  It feels great, silky smooth, makes my skin feel great but truthfully I don't care about that.  I wanted it to reduce the signs of cellulite.  I just switched to Nivea brand...we'll see.",2
3,First of all the smell is terrible.  I feel like I'm washing myself with smelly chemicals rather than soap.  I'm used to using bar soap like Dove and Lever 2000. Those smell so much better.  Also I don't feel like the body wash rinses off clean.  I still feel soapy and I'm never sure for how long to rinse off.  I thought changing to body wash might be better but I think I'll stick with bar soap.,2
3,Can't say I've seen any remarkable results.  Probably my expectations were set a little too high...after all I will turn 70 this year and have earned my wrinkles.  I'll continue with the rest of the capsules and maybe re-write this when I've finished the bottle.,2
3,"The handle of the brush and dotting tool are nicely made, but the hairs of the bristles themselves fray easily, making it hard to create a smooth french tip line. There are better brushes from art supply stores which do not fray and are cheap.",2
3,"As much as I love the Shampoo and serum that go hand-in-hand with this one, it's just not all that remarkable.<br /><br />I live in a very dry climate and my hair is in that stage of being color treated where it is very fly-away an staticy. This product is gentle and isn't stripping my color but it's not very moisturizing either. I actually have been using this and then putting the shine mask on over it just to get my hair to a point it's not sticking out everywhere constantly. My hair is very fine though, so I like that this also isn't so heavy it weighs my hair down. I'm hoping come summer, when the humidity picks up a bit, this will be a better product.<br /><br />Overall, it's not bad, it's just not going to deliver a lot of moisturizing if you're in need of it. I recommend adding a mask product like [[ASIN:B00A0IWSN4 Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Deep Conditioning Shine Mask, 8 Ounce]] and the [[ASIN:B00A0IWSIO Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Moroccan Argan Styling Oil, 3 Ounce]] to your routine for a better overall result at a decent price. :)",2
3,No really good,2
3,"It serves the purpose.  I wouldn't buy it again - it doesn't seem to have the same dark tanning features of the other brands I've used.  It isn't greasy and seems to moisturize, it's just not for me.",2
3.0,GOOD PRODUCT,2
3,"Less fragrant than I had hoped and it seems thinner than this brand's tea tree soap. I love the brand, love they are a family business, and love that they keep other brands accountable to the organic label. I hate that California threatened to sue them for &#34;prescribing&#34; just because the Bronners had printed proven benefits on a product label. Only licensed pharmaceutical companies are allowed that freedom of speech.",2
3,It works but you need to keep buying it,2
3,"This cream didn't bother my sensitive skin and offers a cooling sensation. I did not like the scent, however, and would not purchase again.",2
3.0,Just ok,2
3,I really like this polish..I got my order on time ..very satisfied..,2
3,"I think I may be allergic to something in the formula.  After I used it for two days in November, I had a severe coughing fit in a public place where I could not catch my breath.  It scared the hell out of me.  I haven't had one since.  The only thing different I had added to my diet was the Dr Christopher's Complete Tissue and Bone Formula.  I'm definitely afraid to try it again.  Too bad.  Other people get such great results from the formula.<br /><br />On the other hand, I've been taking Dr Christopher's Herbal Calcium since last September and that seems to be fine.",2
3,"Beauti Cube is large and should hold plenty of makeup, but I'm giving it 3 stars because it was received damaged.<br />The packaging was not damaged, however the face of the bottom drawer is chipped on the left side. I'm returning for replacement and will update review when received.",2
3,This thing is alright. Does it's job but the curls don't hold as well as the Remington one.,2
3,Great brush - just wished the crack between the head and handle didn't painfully yank my hair. I had to put tape over the crack to continue using it.,2
3,"Not my favorite natural sunscreen.  It goes on good, but runs down your body once you get wet. Would be fine for &#34;dry&#34; outdoor activities, but doesn't work for us as our sunscreen for the pool.  Once my kids got wet, it got all milky looking and started running down their bodies.",2
3,"The item is ok. In fact, I got two massage mitts. Different colors: pale blue and pale pink. They look nice. I only wish they were a bit rougher and a bit bigger (fortunately, I have small hands so they fit fine, but if my hands were bigger...I'd be in trouble) And of course you must use them daily to get some sort of result. Exfoliation is very very poor though. Like I said, they are just too soft.",2
3,"Not sure if I am being too critical considering it's temporary tattoos.<br /><br />Plus Side:<br />The pictures are fantastic, better than many real tattoos I have seen.<br />Some are pretty large which are more fun to put on my son's chest<br /><br />Minus Side:<br />Review title says it all. After the first day, some were nearly gone.<br /><br />Maybe my standards are higher since we have given him tattoos that last a week or two (look for the cartoon-ish pirate ones). For this reason, I gave it 3 instead of 2 stars.",2
3,"I bought this flat iron to replace my CHI flat iron, which I loved but stopped working after owning it for less than a year.  The best thing I can say about this iron is that it is OK.  I have very long hair, but very fine, so it shouldn't take much to get it straight.  This iron does not get as hot as the CHI so it takes quite a bit longer to get through my hair.  It is also much heavier than I am used to, so by the time I am finished I feel like I've been through a weight lifting class.  It also does not glide through my hair as easily, and if I'm not careful it will pull out my hair.  So...long story short, I will keep it and use it because I paid for it, but I will certainly be on the look out for deals on other flat irons.",2
3,I received them in a timely manner.  I wanted them to display some hats at a fair - they will work fine but the styrofoam is  scarred.  You get what you pay for.  I  did like the free shipping which is why I ordered them.  If I had to pay for shipping I coulod have gotten them at the beauty supply shop.,2
3,either my hair has grown resistant to color or this is some weak dye. I was REALLY hoping it was gonna turn out like the color on the box,2
3,"it appeared to be a softer pink,  The brand is wonderful, some of their other shades are nice. The eyeliner is great",2
3,"It's an OK product. I've found better and quicker results. But this product does its job, just slowly. I would buy it again but only if I couldn't purchase anything else",2
3,"$10 for a small jar is a bit expensive, I could buy a few bottles of baby powder for the same price and it would last longer.  Did an ok job, but for the price I think ill stick with baby powder.  Its not as powdery as I expected and didn't seem to reduce moisture at all.  It did leave that area smelling nice and feeling soft though.",2
3,The only problem with product from China is if it will come unbroken.  The products don't seem to have the lasting power of American made.  I did get it broken; contacted the company and they replaced the broken part after I sent them a photo of the smashed bulb.  I appreciate thier customer care service.  Thank You.  The light itself is a good buy and it works wonderfully when fully intact.  I would suggest any nail enthusiest to purchase this product.,2
3,Does not last up to 6 weeks as the box advertises. Starts out pretty dark and gets lighter as the days go by. Needs to be re-applied every 1 to 2 weeks. A bit messy with the powder in the capsules; would be better if powder would just come in a little twist off container/bottle. Must be applied very carefully as the color stains the skin where applied.,2
3,"The case itself is pretty cheap as are a few of the interior tools, but some are good. I wouldn't really recommend this product.",2
3.0,Size is too small ... is good for face,2
3,ok product,2
3,"The packaging and presentation is BEAUTIFUL! The gloss color, even on my hand or palette is a pretty as it looks in the container. However, that irredescent appeal is lost once applied to the lips. I have even primed my lups , put concealer on them, as well as tried a very neutral lipstick as the base so that the true essence of the gloss would show....but to no avail.<br /><br />The gloss does impart a decent amount of shine, and is relatively thick, which allows it to remain on lips until it dissipates from eating, drinking, etc.",2
3,"Not enough pigmentation. The feel is a bit sticky. This is probably okay for a little girl's play set. There's very little color, and she would have a great time mimicking Mommy. For makeup divas and fashionistas, this product serves best as a somewhat sticky gloss over lip color that you've already applied.",2
3,Its only been a week so far and nothing yet but im still using it and hoping for the best! Still excited about the hopeful outcome!,2
3,Curlers were just ok.  Being foam I figured I could sleep in them.  I did but it was uncomfortable.  And when I took them out next morning I had an afro that I couldn't get my fingers through much less a comb. Was a mess.  Took lots of conditioning to get hair manageable.  Believe rollers being foam absorbed all the moisture from my hair.  Don't use for long lengths of time for this reason.,2
3,It didn't do much to make darkening spot on my face fade.,2
3,"I have this and like it. I wish it would make my curls tighter, but that is ok. Otherwise still a really good curling additive and it smells nice too. Would buy again!",2
3,It hurts but it does do the job.,2
3,Not as expected,2
3,Works well with the system. Dries my hair out if I don't follow it up with a leave-in conditioner. Good but not great.,2
3,"It irritated my eyes and made my eyelid near the lash line go from red to a bruised purple. It did make my eyelashes a bit longer but I stopped using it after a couple of weeks because of the side effect which from what ive read not everyone has had or at least not sharing. So, I'm giving this product  three stars because I did see some growth in only 2 weeks and that's what it says it do.... and it did list possible side effects ^_^",2
3,"For the price, I think I expected thicker material...  And just a personal preference would have been a snug fit but I realize this is a \\""one size fits all\\"" wrap so that's impossible.  I was actually happy to see that its longer than I thought, and since I'm 6 feet tall, I knew it wouldn't be as long as it appears on the model but it was just enough for me.  Thicker material and a \\""fitted\\""  size would make it more comfortable and add a level of warmth that's currently not present but it serves a purpose, I'm able to jump out the shower, iron my clothes and do my hair prior to dressing around the house.",2
3,Clog easily,2
3,"Very lightweight, as the package advertises. Not terribly impressed with this product, but it's cheaper than buying an entirely new eyeglass frame.<br /><br />Found it very difficult to get a good match on my glasses.<br /><br />An &#34;okay&#34; option.",2
3,"It was okay, I didn't notice any difference in it than other conditions I've used.  Really, just not worth the cost.",2
3,"Arrived on time and well packaged. Unfortunately I cannot use it. It was too harsh for my skin and made my face red and puffy and my skin look absolutely terrible. I have used other Vitamin C products before with the Hyaluronic acid, but this one was too strong.",2
3,"I love this mask in all ways, except for the lumpy back closure.  It fastens with a vertical strip of velcro which is very uncomfortable against the skull when you sleep on your back.  On my side, it is a dream.  So comfortable and comforting.  But I need to sleep on my back a lot of the time and it just doesn't work for that.  So disappointing.",2
3,"Kinda burning sensation, guess it should be that way to work out. Will look for a  gentler Perfect Image product for starts.",2
3.0,a powerful stream but would not able to clean as well as traditional flosser.,2
3,It doesn't work as well as the original blades so I don't think I will order anymore of them. Or maybe that's not what is the matter with the shaver.,2
3,This product is just oky. Nothing special. Really don't like the highlighting effect. Much prefer my benefits no stray or eltamd tinted sunscreen. Good for a night out maybe. I don't think I will be ordering my make up from Amazon unless I can try it out at store first. no problem with buyer. Arrived sooner than expected,2
3,I used this but didn't see much of a difference.  I wasn't real fond of how the pieces turned out after but it definitely deodorizes,2
3.0,Would have liked it more if I'd actually gotten shampoo as listed instead of conditioner.,2
3,Missing brush,2
3,"I was expecting this item to at least have the consistency of zinc cream. Instead it is like normal sunscreen, but it just happens to be made with zinc. Really, you don't need this stuff unless you have an aversion to normal sunscreen, since it is otherwise quite the same, and more expensive. It is however a good product, so long as you know what you are getting.",2
3,"OUCHHHHH! man this thing hurts! I felt like my skin was going to bruise, but I guess thats what you should expect when your hairs are getting ripped out. I wanted this mainly for my underarms, but Ive only used it a few times although Ive had it for many months. I also tried it on my legs.. Basically, it doesn't get all the hair, and its super painful. My underarm skin is too sensitive to shave everyday, but I think getting them waxed might be my better option. Also, the hair grew back faster that I expected, but that supposedly gets better the more you do it- so maybe I'll try it a few more times and see if the results change",2
3.0,good value,2
3,"As one who rocks the Pompadour I found this product to weak to hold the glorious shape of a Pomp. I am sure for a more conservative hairstyle this might do the trick but for a Greaser style avoid this product.<br /><br />The consistency is that of hair gel as opposed to the waxy goodness that is Murray's Pomade or even some of the other Dax products (Wave and Groom looks a lot better).<br /><br />So if your looking for the Greaser look and need the strength to hold a Pomp, pass on this product.<br /><br />EDIT: I ended up finding a use for this, sometimes the Murray's or legit Dax pomades are just a bit too rough, and not enough of a sheen. So I added this along with those other products to soften the hold a bit and to add a nice sheen. So I actually like this stuff as an add-on to another product.",2
3,It says on the box that there are supposed to be 15 strips. I got only 9 in my box. The packaging was terrible. The box was completely smashed and the finishing oil bottle was lying somewhere else in the package. I would say that you buy this at a drugstore.,2
3,"It was not what I expiated and I have not used it as of yet so I can't really rate it as of yet.I have nothing else to say!, This is why I do not like to rate on amazon",2
3,This is a bright pink! Great if you're going for a vintage look.,2
3,"The gel keeps your hair neat, however I found that I could not comb through my hair after using it.  It caused breakage and so I would only use it if I was prepared to wash my hair out after use .",2
3,"I have mid-back length blonde, wavy, coarse, thick hair. I had been using Wen and wanted to try a few other condition only washes and/or no-poos.  This was the first I'd tried after WEN, thinking this may do more for my waves. Wasn't very impressed. Hair felt dry and it actually seemed to make my hair straighter rather than curlier.<br />If your hair needs a bit more conditioning/moisturizing I would not recommend this unless you follow it up with a leave-in treatment.<br />This may do more for people with much curlier hair, but if all you have is wave, I'd try something else.",2
3,"the flavor in king of weird and is incredibly soft, but the second it touches your lips, they are instantly smooth!",2
3,"For an Ultra-firm hold spray, I say this lacks greatly in this area. It barely holds long enough to get outside.",2
3,"my hair history: i bleached my hair from black to pale blonde before i used Gatbsy.  ONce i used it, my hair had a Silver/Purple color to it. i washed my hair and some of the purple faded away however so did the silver. its now the day after i dyed my hair. and i can see some of the Pale blonde returning.  ALL in ALL- hair color has a purple cast to it(dont like it) and the color fades too quickly.",2
3,Not sure of the results as of yet since I just recently purchased it and still using it.,2
3,"So we purchased this for my moms spa and when it arrived we were not so pleasantly surprised.  Buyers BEWARE this is one of those typical super cheap chinese products that lacks instruction and has the worst quality parts I have seen in a while.  Should you strip a bolt or bend a washer you are screwed as there is no after service, such a problem would cause you major delay as you would have to ship the whole thing back and have them send you a new one.  This did not happen to me thankfully.<br /><br />Overall I rated ok because it will do the job.  However I could have spent a lot less money and got the EXACT same product.  The unfortunate thing about these steamers is that there no quality made US products the market has been inundated with the cheapest chinese made stuff you can imagine.  Therefore a buyers sole objective should be to buy the cheapest one available this is TRULY a case where spending more money buys you absolutely NOTHING.<br /><br />***** Further more after 4 days of operation I had to go adjust the steam nozzle for my mom by replacing the felt drip catcher.  Imagine if you didnt have a handy man.  This would have turned into a door stop.",2
3,dh has been using this for sometime now<br />was hoping it would save him a step<br />he has very coarse curly facial hair<br />when he lets it grow out on his beard<br />there are sometimes when he likes to clean it off<br />and let it grow out again<br /><br />this does well to help keep it shaped well<br />however when he goes to shave it off it is lacking<br />leaves so much behind he has to go over with yet another razor<br />so now he has just decided to use this as a trimmer and forget about<br />using it as a shaver because does not work well for him,2
3,My grandson won't keep this on his head.   I used one like it when my children were little and liked it.  Shipping was amazing.  I received it in less than a week after ordering.,2
3,"This electric razor worked very well for me.  I liked the lotion dispenser, I think it really made the difference.    Only problem I have is that the lotion is almost as expensive as the razor when you need to refill it.  For that reason I gave this product 3 stars.  If it was more affordable it would have gotten 5 stars.",2
3,"The fragrance was not the same as in the smaller original bottle which was a wonderful smell which is what I was hoping for. The balm part does it's job just as the original and moisturizes the face, but was disappointed in the fragrance. I just need to keep looking and it's possible they changed the formula and I'll never find it. Nice size bottle.",2
3,"Product is ok, been using for three weeks after dermer rolling. Help my skin heal faster. Would recommend this product",2
3,"I've had this brush set for over a year now and they are OK. The powder brushes shed quite a bit but do pick up a good amount of product, I just feel like I'm constantly getting the bristles off my face. As for the eye shadow brushes they are nice, pick up enough product however I wish they would have provided more of a variety, it seems a lot of them are the same brush just a different size. I am currently looking into getting a new set and I won't be buying another one of Shany brushes.",2
3,"The ultra Cleanse Face & Body Spa Brush could use a little more power. It bogs down a little if you put too much pressure on the face brush and just a little pressure slows it drastically when using the bigger body brush. I put known new batteries that hadn't been in the package for an unknown length of time and it still wasn't great but a little better.Just keep a light touch and keep it moving in a circular motion and it will do a decent job.  I am glad I have it after all that. I get less ingrown hairs on my face, and I now glow. How wonderful!

3,i recived this curling iron the other day  and it was not the one pictured. i had ordered the 25mm but instead i recived the 18mm to 25mm curling iron. im not thrilled about it but it still workes just wish they didnt give false advertisement.,2
3,"Everything came as expected, except the package was missing the dotting tool.  The tool is needed because the rhinestones are so tiny.",2
3,Over rated its a small bottle with little product.,2
3,"What I got worked good , but the lid was loose on one and about 1/3 of it leaked out an was in bag that it was shipped in & soaked invoice too",2
3,The colors for the most part were bright. Easy to wash out. The colors do get all over everything. Would probably avoid in future.,2
3,Not what I expected,2

3,"Even the medium was too light and it doesn't go on as well as other people say it does.<br />However, I guess it would be good for those who want to put on makeup on top of this and have lighter skin.<br /><br />I am not that dark but this looks completely off-color on me.<br />I wasn't using this to control my acne, but just hide my blemishes a bit.",2
3,itis oky,2
3,I just ordered this kit and it should be in tomorrow. Does anyone know what brand of machines these are ? Im a beginner and will be practicing on oranges and such. Any pointers on getting started would be appreciated,2
3.0,Does not match photo not silver and base was dark wood. So it does not match room where I needed to put it as it glows orange.,2
3,Directions don't say how much to use or anything specific. I'm still testing it out,2
3,This is good for dry hair only.  It give nice curls.  Not strong enough to dry wet hair so what I do is I wash my hair let it air dry (or go to bed with wet hair) and in the morning I curled it.,2
3,"This is my fourth Remington shaver.  Overall I love this style of shaver and will continue to use it.  This one in particular has a terrible battery.  I get one good shave out of it before having to charge it.<br />The only good news is it uses a basic AA style battery, but it's not straightforward to change.  You better have decent small-device repair and soldering skills.  I plan on replacing the battery with a Sanyo Eneloop soon.",2
3,"I was excited to receive the lashes however, when I got the box it was smashed and the lashes were a bit messed up. I understand that it was shipped overseas but I just wish I could've gotten them in a better condition.",2
3,"I don't have any particular sensitivity to scents or dyes, but I still love that this product is not scented!  If I wanted to smell nice, I might choose a lightly scented lotion or a dab of quality perfume.  I would certainly not want to smell like scented hairspray!  My only complaint about this particular product is that the \\""firm hold\\"" actually means \\""death grip,\\"" and it leaves my hair incredibly stiff.  I've also noticed that it can flake off or leave a thin gray coating on my hair, which can be avoided if you use it sparingly.  If you want really, really stiff hair, then this is the product for you.  I recently ordered the \\""soft hold\\"" version so I'm hoping that will work better for me.",2
3,It was great except that they only had one instead of the two that they advertising and I needed two!,2
3,"Wish I had read the fine print for this product...headline says it has flash balm, but kit didnt...<br />Wont buy again.",2
3,Not crazy about the scent.  It seems very over powering.  If you like strong scents then this would be ok for you.  I've had other Nag Champa scent lotion that I've like better.,2
3,"So far the foundation seems to be working fine. I have mild acne, sometimes scars left behind that do heal, but the makeup seems to take some work to cover up my problem areas. You do have to be careful when applying, as it can look cakey. I have oily skin, so sometimes if I try and do a quick refresher late in the day before going out, it can look a little heavy. I was also disappointed because it does transfer easily (i.e. if you hug someone, it'll be on their clothing). But I am still new to using it and I do like the glow it gives my skin. I think once I get used to using it, it will get better. If not, I do not anticipate spending the money on it again.",2
3,"Works pretty well, but I don't like the fact that there're so many shapes. I only use it between my eyes and there're very smoothies for that. Too much money for very little product. I'll stick to the frownies. I do have to say that they're easy to apply and like that they're transparent.",2
3,"I ordered this product hoping to get the same effects that I have seen from more concentrated toners (notice, the ad doesn't mention the concentration of the glycolic in the toner).  I was wrong.  This toner really didn't do anything for me.  If you're looking for a really good glycolic toner to get the job done, go with DDF's 10% toner.  It's the best, by far, that I have tried.      In addition, the item arrived packed very poorly.  One of the bottles had leaked out during shipment so that it was only about 1/2 full.      Overall, if you're not looking for something to really refine your pores and let you know it's working, pay the extra $10 and get DDF.  You won't be sorry.  This product may be better suited for aging skin; I'm a little on the younger end of those using these products.",2
3,"Well priced, came on time, nice product. But just not the right red for me and too much to return it. I gave it to a friend. Made my lips look tiny and thin. Like a mail slot.",2
3,"In switching over to the five-blade razor overkill when the cost of the twin blades became too high, my husband noticed a lot more irritability and ingrown hair, regardless of blade age or shaving cream/lotion/oil. Upon researching a better solution we came across the RotoShave by Emjoi. It looked like a cross between a tazer and a torture device, so he was a little skeptical when we opened the package. Following the strict guidelines to not use the Rotoshave on bare skin, he did a test run on his arm with shave cream just to get the feel. Feeling confident after just a few swipes, he moved on to his face. The RotoShave provided a fairly close, even shave with minimal irritation. He did get better results using a thinner shave gel rather than a thick, cream-based shaving lotion, as the thickness tends to coat the blades. Rinsing the unit is effortless, and the two speed settings are welcome if you are particularly overgrown. Of note, this is a razor hybrid with some characteristics of a manual razor and some of an electric one. My husband finds the RotoShave to be less irritating and less pulling then an electric shaver, albeit a little less close than he can get with a manual. He charges the RotoShave every couple of days to ensure good power, and he uses it in the shower exclusively. With an easy learning curve and solid performance, the RotoShave should be on any guy's short list.",2

3,"I recently visited my sister in Oklahoma who has a true gift of hospitality. When she is expecting company, she prepares a gift basket full of goodies, including small personal items and food snacks. This time around, I managed to come home with a tube of Nivea Soft Refreshingly Moisturizing Creme. Since my long time facial moisturizing creme of choice had been discontinued by the manufacturer, I was searching for a replacement. This little tube came in handy. It's very light on my face - doesn't feel greasy and yet has some substance to the mix. In my pursuit of a more permanent moisturizing creme, I've continued to use this product.<br /><br />After the moisturizing creme I had used for 20 years was taken off the market, I tried other products, but some resulted in allergic reactions, however not this Nivea product. Although this product won't be a long term solution for my skin care needs, in part due to my age and my skin being extremely dry, it has been a great fill-in during this in-between time as I continue my search for a product that will be a better fit for my overall needs.",2
3,"&#34;Not really what I expected.  The height adjustment for the &#34;beard&#34; does not work for my beard.  It leaves patches on my face.

Great variety though, something for every event.",2
3.0,I like the smell and the texture but am not sure my skin likes it.  I have had a weird dry break out when I used this yesterday.  Hoping it's just the weather!,2
3,This is an okay product. Its extremely loud when used on high. Not sure I would recommend it to you.,2

3,"The scissors are awkward to use, but overall I guess I can still manage to use them. I don't like having to take off my glasses and put in my contacts just to get a good position of them though. Too much of a hassle if you ask me.",2
3,"This is ok for travel.  It is very small which makes it great in the suitcase but it is very hard to handle and not burn yourself.  It tends to roll and burn surfaces so I set it on a curling iron case which is now singed.  By the way, when I bought this, other reviews stated that a travel case was included.  It wasn't!  Read through the description of what is included.  I guess it changes from time to time.  I really wanted the travel case.  I had to buy one for a full-sized curling iron.",2
3,"Be aware that henna will not give the same coverage, especially for gray hairs, as those products containing ammonia and other chemicals. I use the dark brown cream, which starts out pretty dark.  The coverage is acceptable but not great; I have to reapply after 3 weeks.  This product does not have the strange henna (grass-like) smell and is easy to apply.  Some of the bottles have gritty sediments on the bottom which can be a bit off putting, but it didn't bother me that much. Again, the coverage is only average on my grays.  This product does not cause severe urticaria (hives) so I will continue using it until I can find another henna product that gives better coverage.",2

3,"The apron wasn't so durable. Within a week it ripped, I didn't bother returning it. I expected a more durable item.",2

I wish it lasts longer but I can't complain much since I only paid for $14.<br />The bottle looks really nice and it is made in France.",2
3,"Vaseline Sheer Infusion is a quality product. It's unscented, not super thick or thin, absorbs easily. I don't have a problem with dry skin but I always use body lotion after the shower, and Sheer Infusion is a perfectly satisfactory moisturizer; however there isn't anything particularly remarkable or above-average about it.",2
3,"I don't care for the scent. They have another scent called Citrus Blossom which has the best scent. Wish I got that one instead. It smells like cucumber-ish. Not bad at all, just not my favorite.<br /><br />On a positive note, it is definitely hydrating for dry skin. I will re-purchase in the Citrus Blossom next time.",2

3,THE PRICE IS TOO HIGH,2
3,"I've tried several Foxbrim products and enjoyed each one. The opportunity to try the Foxbrim Peptide Complex Serum came along and I jumped at the chance to do so.  I tried a couple of peptide products several years ago from a high end cosmetic company and thought that these might be nice to use. They were, however, too pricey for my pocketbook. This Foxbrim Peptide is affordably priced.<br /><br />Now what do I think of this product?<br /><br />I found it very thick for a serum. When I tried to dispense it using the dropper, it was not going into the dropper as serums usually do. It seemed that the dropper was pulling air instead of serum. I'd have to kind of stir and then depress the dropper bulb to engage the serum.<br />The serum goes on the face nicely. I don't notice any fragrance or odor. It does tend to have a &#34;tacky&#34; feel as it dries. But this is not such that would  make it undesirable to use.<br />After applying the serum, I used my morning moisturizer. Then I applied my makeup for the day. Works fine.<br />I have not noticed any real improvement in my skin after using it for a couple of weeks. But neither have I noticed any detrimental effects.<br /><br />I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review. Opinions expressed are solely my own. No compensation was received.",2
3,"My opinion is still out to date because this bottle was too small a sample to give a full and truth evaluation of the product.  I did, however, get a larger bottle (different brand) to give myself a fair shot of a good or bad evaluation.  Sooooo I'll get back to you on it.",2

3,"I got this lotion and have used it in several different types of beds. I can't stand the fruity smell. It reminds me of cheap bodyspray that was popular in junior high. As for the \\""warming\\"" actions? I barely noticed, and when I do, its only in certain places. This lotion does not have a tingle...it's more of a heat sensation. As for bronzers, I dont really see it doing anything different than my Black 20X. Once I've showered, there's no risk of it sweating off onto clothes. I appreciate that. Overall, it does what most other Designer Skin lotions do for me, so I don't really see the point of paying extra.",2
3,My 11 year old didn't feel much tension in the springs on this particular product.  I didn't either when I tried it.,2
3,Did not see any results after using this product especailly for the price. Think way over priced.. Will not buy again.,2
3,The teeth on this ball are not tight enough to hold the pad in place every time. You have to be extra careful if your plug is sideways.,2
3.0,"This shampoo smells pretty good, and it doesn't smell anything like the overpowering coconut fragrances that most other coconut-based shampoos have. It has a very thick and creamy consistency and forms a gentle foam once you rub it into the hair. The scalp will feel clean, without the harsh sulfates and parabens that most standard shampoos have. It works good enough on my thick transitioning hair, but i definitely have to follow it up with a good moisturizing conditioner to add more softness and &quot;slip&quot;, as this shampoo doesn't provide enough of it for my hair after i rinse it out.",2
3,This sunscreen is really matte and works as an good make-up base. But it leaves a white cast on my face (I am medium-Tan). Would be better for someone with a much lighter skin tone.,2
3,The 12 rollers are enough for my fine hair.  This set comes with super clips that hold your hair in place but  leaves marks in your hair.  There isn't anywhere to store the clips except on the original cardboard strip that the clips came on.  There is one roller that has a dot that changes color when the hair setter is ready.  The curls don't last very long even with a lot of hair spray.,2
3,"Was very excited to get this product.  It is easy to use and does not take a lot of time.  I have been using it in the morning and at night.  I can see a very slight improvement but, not what I was hoping for.  I will continue to use it for another 4 weeks and see if there is noticeable improvement.<br />Overall, I am disappointed with the Derma Wand.  I do not think it is strong enough to have the effect shown on the TV demo's<br /><br />age 64 with previous face lift",2
3.0,"Not so easy to apply, need to rub the white paste intensively.",2
3,I'm not sure what I expected. This is a good piece for the price.Just make sure to have brand new batteries or it won't trim very well.,2
3,"I have wavy/curly hair and use a diffuser everyday so not to break up my curls... This hairdryer was actually too powerful (even on the lowest setting) for my delicate curls.  If I was going to blow it straight I'm sure it would have cut my drying time but for my type of loose curls, I needed the diffuser to diffuse more (It felt like the diffuser wasn't holding back any of the air) and the air not to be so powerful (on low).  I ended up returning this hairdryer and going back to my original lightweight Revlon.  I wouldn't recommend this dryer to someone with fragile/lightweight curls but I would recommend for everyone else.",2
3,okay brushes. doesnt have discription name on each brush as in the picture. just plain white brushes with the colors at the start of the bristles,2
3,Rather have 100 than 75,2
3.0,Not good for shaving your head unless you want to be bald bald bald. Not what I wanted. You'd have to first shave with clippers then use this.,2
3,doesn't really do the job.,2
3,I can't tell that it helps with eyelash growth at this point.  Maybe more time using it will tell.  I can't really recommend it at this time.,2
3,I'm not sure if it's because the item was already open and damaged when I received it(i got a refund) or if that's just how it is. Overall I'm just trying to get rid of it right now. I'm trying the other ecostyler gels out but will not purchase this one again.,2
3,I've used this for over 4 months (now almost through with my tube of this eye cream) and it hasn't improved my dark circles. I can say that the scent is very pleasant like cocoa butter and moisturizes my eye area though. Most likely won't repurchase.,2
3,The trimmer work fine . I was expecting for a closer trim . Therefore I rated a 3 star for that reason,2
3,You have to be very careful with this product. Takes time to get used to it.,2
3,"The model I have has a Clean and White mode that is to brush for two minutes and then a change in sound and motion is to be the signal to start brushing the upper front teeth,  At the sound of a beep, you are to brush the lower front teeth.  However, I do not sense a change in brushing sound or motion in the first phase nor do I hear a beep to start the second phase.  Very disappointed with this issue.<br /><br />Having said that, I am pleased with the product overall.  The brush head will stop brushing when it senses too much pressure being applied to the teeth.  I tend to brush hard (resulting in receding gums) so this feature is very important to me.  The true test will be when I visit the dentist in four months or so.",2
3,"To begin, I am a big fan of the almond verbena smell. It's a great &#34;clean&#34; fragrance that's just sweet enough to be interesting and the whole aroma sits well with me.  But at the end of the day, this is a 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner formula that just doesn't do a heck of a great job on my hair.  I generally like Suave products, but I've never cared for this combo formula and there doesn't seem to be any improvement on the formula.  So, my hair is cleansed and softened well enough, but not to the extent of a separate Suave shampoo and conditioner and my hair feels ever so limp.  Nothing horrible, mind you, but nothing spectacular.",2
3,The polish isn't what I thought it would be. I'm not a fan of the color on my skin tone (dark skin). Gelish product is amazing nothing against the product. recieved in a reasonable time.,2
3,"This inexpensive device really works.  It leaves my skin clean,soft, and supple - even at my age, 64! However, I think the microdermabrasion pads (puff refills) are over priced at $.51 a piece. I re-use mine several times before replacing them.  I'm giving the system a 3 star rating due to the expensive puff refills.",2
3,"It came with everything, but the butterfly only works half the time and doesn't do much for me.  Guess i'l be keeping my old one.",2
3,Case is cheap and doesn't close properly but the manicure items are decent.,2
3,Wasn't expecting it to be so much like Vaseline. I think if you are recovering from a major procedure and need a sensitive product with a lot of &#34;punch&#34; this would work well. But doesn't fit my needs for a nightly moisturizer since it's so very greasy.,2
3,Didn't really work on my asian hair.,2
3,Feel free to buy this leave-in if you just want to match brands with the deep conditioner.  It weighed down my hair to much for a blow out.  I may work better with looser curly hair.,2
3,Works great but the handle is much thicker than my prior oral b and not as comfortable.,2
3,"It did not fill my need , the product is very well made, I had very limited use for it",2
3,"Even though I ordered fair, I received medium.  That's not such a bad thing bc its mixed with moisturizer but not enough.  I use it but I have to use an spf underneath.",2
3,Read the description carefully.  Although the title says 100% it is not 100% carrot seed oil.  Who knows how much carrot seed oil is actually in it.,2
3,"There's not a lot in the bottle.... However, the truth is that there was 'some' noticeable change in amount of visible cellulite on my bottom and the back of my legs. I run avidly - about 15 miles a week and my bottom and the back of my legs is still lumpy. I did see a difference but not enough to want to run and throw on a swimsuit. I am not overweight but I'm not skinny. I'm 5'6\\"" and 140lbs (muscular legs). Maybe some of the other reviews are from people who have very small amounts of visible cellulite but I don't see what all the hype is about honestly.",2
3,"I don't think mine was a fake but it's durability and projection are the worst from a designer label. It gets 3 stars because the scent is nice but you'll have to spray twice as much to smell anything. I usually spray two or three times with any cologne. This one, you have to spray 5 times minimum and it'll be non existent in a few hours.",2
3,"As mentioned in the title, this was my first diffuser.  So I'm no expert.  That said, it didn't meet my expectations.  I expected it to diffuse the air in a small room in my place with the scent of eucalyptus oil.  I tried multiple times with different amounts of water and oil and it never really produced any scent.  The only time I could smell anything is if I went right up to the small opening where the mist was coming out of.  I think that's unacceptable.  I ended up returning it.",2
3,"Yikes, this stuff is very heavily scented and smells a very \\""grandma/popurri-ish\\"" to me. It is basically vaseline (and I like vaseline on my lips) so I find it effective but the scent very off-putting and feels odd applied to the lips.",2
3,too early to tell definitively...but so far so good..  will know more certainly in the weeks to come..severalmore applications will determine final outcome.,2
3,"I actually did not know that Old Spice no longer existed until I bought this product.  After noticing that the scent dissipated in about 3 or 4 hours, I did some online searching and found that Old Spice was having problems with the rising cost of the spices that made the original scent, and Proctor and Gamble bought them out.  In retrospect, unless someone has found a way to get supplied by growers of the spices at the right costs, I cant see how anyone could do better.  No complaints, just sympathy.  Happens to all of us somehow, changing times.",2
3,"I was really looking forward to getting this for my 7 and 9 year old girls.  It is a piece of junk.  It should be called a Glide OVER brush because that's why it doesn't pull the hair because it is just gliding OVER the knots.  I do not recommended it.      UPDATE:  As I had stated before, the product I had received originally did not meet my expectations.. After posting my review here I was contacted by customer service and they were very responsive to my concerns and offered a refund for my dissatisfaction in the product. This is what customer service is all about.. NOT forgetting your customers... You can buy any given product anywhere for retailers are eager to get your $$.. Its how the companies handle things when they go wrong that counts.. And that my friend is how you earn my repeat business... ;-) After a few weeks they have contacted me again with an offer for a NEW and Improved product to try FREE.. Whoopi! Can't wait to try it out.. Will post some Feedback soon~",2
3,"So, I love the idea here, but there are some considerations. First, the S/M is more for training bras or people who are very small/petite. So, I wish they would just call it Small rather than S/M. I think most women would need the Large/XL, even though it sounds big, I think it suit more people.<br /><br />Second, the right fit is important because if it's too tight, the part that grabs the back of your bra straps starts to cinch the strap, so you have two, tiny bunches by your shoulder blades that stick out like little bumps on your back.<br /><br />Finally, the clips do slip once in a while, so there is a chance they'll come undone. Then you'll have a swinging strap on your back.<br /><br />Again, I like the idea here, and it's better more often than not. But it's not as revolutionary as I thought it would be. :)  I'm still waiting for a better solution.",2
3,"After reading the reviews, I was excited to try out this eyeliner that was supposedly smudge-proof. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case for me. It only took about 1-2 hours before the eyeliner smudged to my outer eye area. It's nothing I can't find for $2 at the local drug store.",2
3,I got the attachments fast and they are of good quality. Just got two number 4's and no number 5. Luckily I don't really use #5 much. Other than that I am happy.,2
3.0,"Owned this product for 3 years. Bought in from Amazon Austria.<br /><br />Never had much success with the shaving head.<br />Took to long to get a clean shave an my balls or chest, and got cut or scratched multiple times in the process.<br />Switched to a regular safety razor and received much cleaner results, without cutting myself in the process.<br />The trimming side works well. I mostly used it to trim my thick leg hairs without them looking stubbly or clean-shaven.<br /><br />Sadly the battery service time was a disappointment as well. I often had to stop and recharge during usage.<br />&#34;Was&#34; because the product refused to charge after 3 years using the included charger, and I never bothered replacing them.<br /><br />Looking forward, I wouldn't buy this product again. I'm looking for a simple body hair trimmer, and use a safety razor when I want a clean shave.",2
3,This is my first time to use Dr. Denese products.  The hydrating cleanser has helped my skin texture I do not feel tight or dry after washing my face.  I would highly recommend the Hydrating Cleanser.  Received the product very quickly from seller,2
3,"I guess this product was old, because the smell was so weak. Wish I could fine a good jar. Any one has a newer jar?",2
3,"I  don't mind running water on it to get it to a usable state, but unfortunately I am allergic. Made the skin darker, itchy and blistered.",2
3,"Good enough for the price, but some of them rip apart very easily. I had bought them thinking about offering for guests to wear for a few hours, but now I am re-tihinking it and will probably get another type.",2
3,"luv the diffuser...disappointed with the manual,  should come with cleaning instructions and blend recipes.  Otherwise great~",2
3,The product is what it says it is.  I loved the idea of it. My problem was I couldn't find a shade to match my hair color (lighter shade of brown w/ a little bit of red).  And it took forever for me to get my never been worn clip in returned.,2
3,"Please measure your head.  I have a big head.  So this gave me a headache.  This is good if you've got a 21 inch or less head.  The hair is decent quality, a little flimsy but ok.  It looks as it seems in the photo.  This wig is a nice style but not for me.<br /><br />Good delivery.<br />Good packaging.",2
3,"Its an open box, missing head cover.",2
3,"This product keeps brows in place all day ...however, it flakes at times which is annoying ... have used other products such as Tweezerman Brow Mousse the hold not as strong but zero flaking ... which to me is a huge plus",2
3,"The color is hot, the hair is sooo perfect...until about the 7th day then hello matts and tangles and frizz! This hair looks a hot mess after a week! The picture does it no justice. When I received the hair the lace and curls are awesome. It literally looks like it growing out of my scalp. I just wish that the hair quality was better. I'm ordering a new one just to have for fun, this is not a good everyday wig.",2
3,I didn't notice anything amazing about it.  I like it but other products work just as well.  Consistency is good,2
3,Smooth application as to it's working proprities it's equal to less expensive brands on the market no miracle in a bottle here,2
3,"Takes a little time to heat but I usually apply my makeup while it is heating.  I like the 20 rollers--need that amount to set my full head. However, it doesn't curl the hair that tightly and you have to leave the rollers in for a few minutes so the curl doesn't fall out.    Also, the sizes of the rollers are distributed in an uneven manner.  I had to make a diagram so I could put them back in the right order. It's good for the price but I would go with something better.",2
3,Need more time or more water,2
3,"Well, It did not whiten my teeth as I expected,but very very little  improvements I noticed,the smell I liked,gives You the feeling of fresh teeth ))))).",2
3,Useful tool if you try extensions. Spare micro rings are a plus.,2
3,"I've bought this product many times, in stores and in Amazon, and usually love it.<br />But this time, the product was old and dry. Not creamy. Wasn't worth my time or money to ship it back.",2
3,I haven't really seen a difference in anything that it claims other than being a moisturizer. The only plus is that it's all natural ingredients.,2
3,"The color is darker than what you see in the picture, other than that its a good product",2
3,"There is a &#34;sweet&#34; taste to the jell which is not very pleasant.  Other Philips Zoom bought from another website and from my Dentist did not have this taste..  What I was really unhappy about, however, was that I had to pay £11.00 Duty before the Royal Mail would delivery the package to me.  This increased the total cost quite a bit.",2
3,Also a bit tingly and soothing.  Same thing could be accomplished much cheaper if you added a few drops of eucalyptus essential oil to plain paraffin beads.,2
3,I rated this 3 stars because it was a great price. Nothing spectacular about the smell. But not terrible. It doesn't seem to have many notes other than the 1st note and it last about 4 hrs.,2
3,"I only gave 3 stars because I did not receive the stamper and scraper with the kit as advertised. The plates are great though. I've tried at least 10 of the full nail patterns and they almost all come out wonderfully. However, I had to buy a separate stamper (I purchased a Konad, which is GREAT), in order to use the plates, so I cannot say how well the stamper with the kit would work. I did receive more than 10 plates, but a couple were duplicates so I'm glad I had the extra. They have a nice selection of patterns as well. They are very sturdy and the patterns come out really nice, even with cheap nail polish.",2
3,"Very cute, however, I purchased this because my daughter loves black and white Holstein cows.  The cow we got was brown and tan.  You should have accurate pictures. 😕",2
3,"I bought this based on all the great reviews.  I am slightly disappointed.  My main gripe with this set is the lack of variety in brushes.  Most all the brushes are in doubles (dark and light color usage).  What you don't see in the photos are that they are all of the flat variety types.  There are no brushes in the set that are those thick bushy type great for blending/building color.  I really wished there would have been thick rounded blending brushes, which would make it a more complete set.  I agree with others that the brushes are soft, and pick up color just as well as my other sephora brushes.  The pouch it comes in is very cheap pleather, and the smell is not that overwhelming (nothing that a good cleaning can't get rid of).",2
3,"I received this in the mail yesterday, I love it!!!! But the negatives it took about a 4 weeks for me to receive it & it had no case!",2
3,"it's okay, for now. There was another one I should have bought instead. But for now it will have to do.",2
3,"Ehh it's okay, not all that but I mean you get what you pay for right? It does leave your skin very soft. I would use this primer just for when I go to work but not a night out on the town",2
3,"This Item received is not what is pictured. I received something called HYDRASOURCE with purple plant logo rather than the green leaf one pictured that I thought I was buying. The seller??placed a sticker on it that says &#34;Conditioning Balm&#34;. I peeled it off to see beneath and it just says conditioner.<br /> I have waste length thin long hair that is fair- the original conditioning balm is the best stuff ever. I have not been able to find the green one anymore. I would pay almost anything for the green leaf labeled original conditioning conditioning balm --the one pictured by the seller-- nothing works as good and I have tried almost everything- including this purple labeled stuff that came in the mail.  Hydrasource is good- a step up from drugstore stuff -- but not great, the very next day my hair is dry again.This product in my experience on my hair is an inferior formula to the original- could it be why it sat on a shelf for a while?.. judging by  the dirt on the edges of the clear label on this tub I just now pulled out of the mail box.",2
3,"this stuff smells GREAT but i got it at Bealls Outlet for $4 dollars, $14 dollars is WAYYY TOO MUCH",2
3,"It works well on the face and the hair does not grow back thicker. I use it on my upper lip. The down side is that it doesn't get a close enough shave, so you feel the stubble right after using it.",2
3,"i've been shaving with a rotary electric for a long time, but decided to try razor shaving for more closeness and less irritation (the two things all us guys want!)  however, i was disappointed by this..  first off i felt \\""pulling\\"" on my cheek.  it was only about 2 days' growth.  i thought \\""the blades should be sharper than this.\\""  it was probably 8 years ago i first shaved with a twin-blade gillette, but it seemed every bit as technically advanced as this (minus one blade), shaved fast and i got NO irritation.  huh?  how has their technology actually gone backwards??  pulling isn't the only problem though.  the worst problem was the microcuts!  i got cut on both sides of my neck and one part of my cheek.  luckily my other cheek, chin and under nose were spared.  i do have very sensitive skin, and i already had some razor burn there so it might have exacerbated the problem, or maybe my skin has to get used to a razor, but nonetheless i was disappointed.  the shave was close, but hey, that's what i expect from any razor.  the lubricating strip is useless IMHO because you have to hold it a certain way for it to contact.  besides, isn't using a good soothing shaving gel more important?  so i have to rate this as a 3 stars, average razor.  i'm sure it's perfectly good for most people, but for a guy like me with sensitive skin it didn't work as well as i hoped.  some people are praising the conventional razor style (not all weird like the mach 3/m3 power/gillette fusion design).  ok, fine, but how is it i got a better shave with that really old gillette razor i'm sure they don't even make anymore?  i'm confused.  and now i'm curious what kind of performance i would get with a mach 3......",2
3,"Shampoo bottle always spills when travelling (even when properly sealed and taped).  Not sure how this happens, but it is very inconvenient.",2
3,I expected more color. Said in a few words: it's just a transparent (no color) lip gloss with minty sensation.,2
3,"For most bauty products I have favorite brands.  Alas, it is not the case with mascaras.  As beauty companies are coming up with new products that make lashes look better, thicker, more voluminous  I keep searching for the brand that will make me completely happy.  Clinique is trusted brand so I gave them a try.  This mascara will definitely make your lashes look long and thick.  I use it in black color and my lashes really open up the eyes after macara application.  However you need to be careful how much mascara you apply on the lower lashes.  Product has ability to smudge by the end of the day.  So while it is not perfect, it is a good product worh giving it a try.",2
3,"Been using this product for a while. Does what it suppose to do. Smooth your skin when first put on, works w/foundation well. I don't think it &#34;stays&#34; on, not much shine control.",2
3.0,The color is very dark and hard to see the sparkle. But delivery and customer service was great!,2
3,"I'm surprised the seller doesn't mention that when gold shea butter is turned into white shea butter it loses a lot of its healing properties. Yes the gold stuff smells, but it's a lot better to use.",2
3.0,Doesn't smell as coconut-y as I would like....more of a sugary sweet smell.,2
3,"The leave in conditioner serum was nice, but I knew I could find something with better results. Didn't do enough for me to keep, so returned it.",2
3,"Hair looks really good when curled and wet; however it started to tangle really bad by the third week and i had to take it out. Also, trying to straighten the hair is next to impossible so don't buy if you want to straighten the hair. But the curl pattern is amazing and it looks really good when wavy.",2
3,I bought these because they were recommended. I don't see how they are any better than any other cheap brand.,2
3,"While wet, my hair felt good. This product didn't leave lasting moisture, and my hair felt stiff after it dried.",2
3,"I've used several other clinical strength antiperspirants that I liked a lot better than this one.  This one does work ok for about a day.  It comes out basically the same way as the others in this class - it has a little dial at the bottom that you click click til it squirts out the white goo at the top.  You have to turn it a lot the first time to get it started.<br />It doesn't smell that great.  It's not bad but it's rather sharp and not very feminine, but it's not really a smell I've enjoyed on my husband either when he's used it.  It might as well be be a fragrance for a dishwash, not a person.  It's not bad, but it's not that great on people, if that makes sense.<br />Also, I don't like what happens when I get really wet, like if you are out in the rain, or swimming.  I don't mean under my arms, but I mean, all over.  If I get sweaty and my underarms get wet, they feel slimy to me.  This has happened 2-3 times so it wasn't just some freak thing.<br />It would be fine if you were just going to work or out walking or something, but I don't like it out in the garden when I'm using a hose or getting in the pool.",2
3,I have indented scars from a laser resurfacing botched procedure.  I can see using these if you scar is new & raised. Other wise if your looking for something for ice pick scars or any kind of indented scar I would look somewhere else. At first i thought it was working but it only flattened  them out for few hours after using them all nite & day for a long time. I think it would work good for raised scars is the reason i gave a better rating.  Silicone is good for scars. Keeps them moist.,2
3.0,Not a fan doesn't blend well and falls a part when washed and makeup doesn't come off of it,2
3,"I received my product fairly early which was the great part, but when you look closely at the product, all the rhinestones are the same shape -_-",2
3,I bought these after reading all of hte hype but must say they didn't work for me.  I didn't notice any difference after putting these in my heels.  I really wanted them to work.,2
3,"actually pretty much shine, you can see its metallic, picture doesnt show but expected to have sparkles. 80% true to color",2
3,"I have fine, naturally curly and chemical treated hair.  For me, the shampoo and conditioner dry and frizzy. It does smell great and my scalp feels healthier.",2
3,Digital Screen very small.  The sleek black finish makes it hard to read.  Keeps good time and easy to set.  Speaker volume fair.,2
3,I was so excited to receive this product but once I opened it I was disappointed with the lack of fragrance and the amount of time the little fragrance lasted. I would not recommend this product if you're looking for a medium to strong aroma.,2
3,"The mascara was opened when I bought it. It seemed like it was tampered with, but it works great. I don't understand why it was opened.",2
3,"This tool works and is well made, but it has a really wide head on one end that is angled in such as way that you have to hold the tool perpendicular to your face.<br />I much perfer the Revlon, as it is angled better and had a tighter loop to all for more targetted use.",2
3,This color is very frosty. After my nails were all done I couldn't help feeling like I was looking at my grandmothers hands!,2
3,"I bought this on sale and use it daily on face, neck, chest and hands, however it goes on pasty white (perhaps has zinc oxide in it) and must be smoothed so your skin doesn't look chalky. This is fine if you're very fair, but if you're tan it can be challenging.  Also it rubs off in white flakes unlike suncreens which are totally sheer.  I bought it for the high 100 SPF because it's so difficult to reapply every 2-3 hours as recommended, but I don't think I'll buy this again due to not wanting to worry that my face has 'white stuff' on it.",2
3,"I am 47, with moderate circles appearing over the last few years. I am also developing some fine lines around my eyes. This concealer does lighten them somewhat (using upside-down, triangle trick), but I find that it tends to gather in fine lines by mid day. I'm still on the hunt for something with more coverage/staying power.",2
3,"I bought 3Q and received it in the same week. The condition of machine was very good and was working very well. I bought this for my husband and we were sad as his feet size is 10 and his foot was not fully fitting in the machine. If the foot is high or fat from near the leg joint, 2 to 3 inches from toes than the foot does not reach fully in the machine. After trying couple of time he gave up as his foot was hurting.<br />Its a good machine but pls buy checking your foot size.",2
3,I didn't like the acrylic at all & it doesn't have a lot.! It drys up too fast. Everything else is ok.,2
3,No more breaking hairs my carrot seed oil keep my hairs  so shine and  Make them grew up so fast.,2
3,"The applicator is entirely too fine. Leaves an unnatural, shiny and jagged line of eyeliner in your lid that is difficult to refine or thicken without making a mess. Not my favorite. I prefer the revlon felt pen eyeliner.",2
3,"I would love to give this 5 stars but I was really disappointed in the size and shape of it. I didn't see any other size but this is too small for my neck. I am a woman, a bigger woman. I just measured my neck at the base where I would want this to wrap around and my neck is exactly 16 inches. I didn't see any size when I ordered it either.  I have had other neck wraps before and they are more flexible. This one has stiff material, even with the beads inside. It cuts into my neck when I use it. I will say though that the beads feel wonderful and the moist heat relieves the tension in my neck after typing all day. I will still use it but will probably keep looking for something that will be better suited for me. If I were to guess, I think it would be best for up to 14-1/2 inches. Sorry guys, I think you're out of luck on this one!",2
3,I love the bright color of this polish. why i gave it a 1/2 star because it peels of so easy. If you are planing on doing your nais you have to wait till the day even time of.,2
3,I was really looking forward to using this product but I feel like it just made my skin dry. I will continue to use it before I moisturize and hope that will make a difference.,2
3,This is a good ideal to all ladies!!! My friends ask how do I get them so good!! They want to know my secret and when I showed they wanted it.,2
3,"The product is fine, however I prefer the deep cleansing hand soap.  It is also anti-bacterial.  The other negative is that the shipping costs were excessive.  For this reason I will not reorder.",2
3.0,"Just received,<br />Although I did not open the package to smell this fragrance I cannot write an honest review about how it smells.  However, I can write a review about the size of this product.  When I got my package I was not sure what was even in the package because it was so light.  Whenever I opened it and saw this tiny bottle I almost fell on the floor.  I cannot see paying $18 and some change for this teeny tiny bottle.  I can pick up a six piece assorted clean roll on parfum's at Sephora for $20.00, and they are a nice size...so back this goes...Sorry wanted to like it.",2
3,"Wow, 12 hours is no joke. They could probably get away with saying 15 hours. Eat, drink, kiss, try to scrub it off with makeup remover, nothing gets rid of the vibrant color. Speaking of vibrant color, they may match your mood, but only if your mood is bold and bright. It took me a week trying one every day (and looking like a clown for most of them) to figure out that there wasn't a mellow color in the pack. If you want bright, bold, and ever lasting, go for it.",2
3,scratched very easily.,2
3,"I just bought a Sonicare toothbrush and the Sonicare Airfloss. My husband has recently been diagnosed with a degenerative memory disorder. This aparently now causes him to \\""remember\\"" he has just brushed his teeth when he actually hasn't. He is a diabetic and, well.... Let's just say he was recently complaining of tooth pain and we discovered at the emergency dentist visit that his gums were swiftly sliding into problemville.<br /><br />My hope is that with the Airfloss and Sonicare brush we can reverse this slide. Further, these two products - and especially the Airfloss - will allow me to more easily do his oral care for him when that time comes. And it WILL eventually come...  :(<br /><br />I will update this review as we use the Airfloss. The 3 stars reflects only the fact that this is, essentially, an unfinished review.<br /><br />My husband has not yet tried the Airfloss.<br /><br />However, I have tried the Airfloss myself tonight. First use. It was an odd sensation. Nowhere near as messy as a Waterpic. It does create a relatively loud and jarring puff of water and air. This may be a problem for some people. I got used to it pretty quickly and found it wasn't really a problem.<br />Because of my husband's illness he became unemployable, and so I have been without dental insurance for a couple of years. I've been relatively good about brushing and flossing, but it's been a LOOoooong time since my teeth have had a proper dental hygenist cleaning. The Airfloss knocked some solid chunks of plaque off my teeth. Big chunks. That alone might be enough to recomend it.<br /><br />But my full review will cover wether or not this is a good product to use for cleaning another person's teeth.<br /><br />Stay tuned.",2
3,"Too slippery ,and  too thin. Need to be careful of not scratching to hard in your skin. Good size and collapsed very nicely",2
3,I did not see any diffence in my fine lines than I saw by using the drug store brand item like L'oreal or Olay anti aging products.  I have used a lot of different product on my face. I am using Estée Lauder now and I can honestly say that it is a great product but as far as results I see no diffence than say the L'oreal products.,2
3,"The price was right for the amount of lashes received, not gonna complain there. The quality of the lashes though isn't up to par. However, with the right glue, and application process anyone can make these work. These are my emergency lashes now, in the event I dont have time to buy new ones or have time to apply the individual lashes.",2
3,smells amazing doesnt last more than 20 mins..,2
3,"Requires you to rotery file the back for a better fit, there totally flat but look great after you put them on!",2
3,"I really liked these tweezers when I first got them but after a while, they weren't quite as effective.  I don't know why but that was my experience.",2
3,It's okay,2
3,"I have only been using the cream for about three weeks.  I like the way it feels on my skin.  However, the cream did not make a difference with the two problem areas on my face, at least not yet.  I would say for the money, I was expecting that it should make some noticeable difference in a three week time period.  Perhaps it's worth trying some highly rated less expensive creams.  Sometimes we assume because it's expensive, it's the best.",2
3,Didn't work as well as I expected. I was kind of disappointed,2
3,"not very sturdy, but adequate.",2
3,Its a nice lip gloss and pleasant in taste but feel its not anything special and because of that over priced.  Just thought I'd give it a try.,2
3,"It doesn't last very long, and I wish it was more citrusy.  It's a soft fragrance. If perfumes tend to give you a headache,  as many do me, this is a good one. I had to reapply it more frequently that I ever do with perfume,  but no headache!",2
3,"very indifferent about this product, I dont see a difference with my sweating at all and i have hyperhidrosis. :-(",2
3,I had great expectations & it's just OK.  Wouldn't be so bad of a product if it wasn't so expensive - for the price it should come close to making miracles.,2
3,I liked it but then in the photo I assumed I was getting two heads and not one. I was very surprised when I only received one head. The actual price of one head is around $16.,2
3,"I have started using it, but it's too early to tell yet if its working as I hope it will.",2
3,Anew Clinical Advanced Winkle Corrector is just okay.  I still have my wrinkles just like I had before using this product but I was okay for a moisture cream.,2
3,Great colors and price. But they are not long lasting at all.  I recommend this for people on a budget.,2
3,I have been using this mask with the daily cleanser from the same line and after three weekly of religous use my blackheads are decreased in size but not gone by any means-yet another blackhead remover dissapointment,2
3,The price on these replacement heads is so high! As soon as possible I switched my son to the adult version--replacements aren't nearly as expensive.,2
3,"I have scars on my legs from bug bites, scratches, burning myself with hot irons, etc. I applied it and I started noticing them fading away about 3 weeks after starting. It also doesn't smell bad and comes in a cute container",2
3,"The Aussie Sprunch Spray makes my hair look casual, effortless, and gives it a little shine. It's very lightweight. It doesn't make your hair feel \\""crunchy\\"" or have that hard feel to it. It also gives flexibility. As much as I love the Aussie Sprunch Spray, I love the Aussie Mousse and Leave in Conditioner even more!   I tested this product at no cost, this is just my opinion!",2
3,"If you want a lot of eyeshadows from natural to dramatic, from nude to colourful, this is a great way to get a lot for your buck. The quality isn't fantastic and you will probably need to build up the shades or apply a base to really get some bang out of them, but this is a great way to start experimenting with makeup.",2
3,"I rated this 3 stars because my husband absolutely loves it.  I hate it, or it hates me.  I can't taste anything after using it.    I used it at night and I liked how it made my mouth feel very clean.  Unfortunately, it numbed my taste buds.      My husband made me a cup of coffee in the morning after I used it, and I thought he had made a mistake and put hot water and milk instead of coffee.  Then I got up and made myself a cup.  Same thing, it's like strong tastes have been edited out of my taste buds.      I only used this because my husband likes it so much.  He keeps one bottle at his office and one bottle at home.  He doesn't have any problems with tasting things afterwards.  In fact he told me that whatever I was experiencing could not be caused by mouthwash.  I looked it up online though and I'm not the only one who has had this issue.    So give this a try if you had really terrible bad breath problems, but don't try it the day before you have any good meals planned in case you get the strange side effect.  I'm so glad I didn't try this the night before we went on our wine tasting trip.",2
3,"If you're looking for cheap travel, on the go brushes these are it",2
3,"3 Stars, Just Ok, apx 5.70USD, 04-15, Too Pricey, Tube Too Small.<br /><br />For this price, a person should get at least 3 oz of product, which would be about half the size of a now-standard tube of toothpaste. At a mere 1.5 ozs., it will run out very quickly if everyday I follow the directions of using a half inch strip. If this moistened my mouth so well that it pleasantly surprised me, made me think &#34;yes, this is the solution to my problem, finally&#34;, I might think the price was worth it. But that is not the case. The gel took away the dry for about 3 minutes. That's it. I've tried the mouthwash too: even worse.<br /><br />Final Recom: Wait for it to go on sale and keep your expectations low.",2
3,I love this lotion but it was just put into an envelope and it got crushed and cracked in the mail so the pump does not work and it's pretty much unusable. It was also late... The lotion itself has a nice shimmer and the scent is lovely.,2
3,the foundation is medium to full coverage but wen it sets it seems to make me look ashy but I use the pressed powder to set it and its not that bad I only wear it when I'm just sitting around the house or when I go to the grocery store that's it but overall its ok!,2
3,I get a #3 haircut every 4-6 weeks so figured I would try this out. So far I am not impressed.<br /><br />Charge claims 30 minutes but it was starting to bog down after 15. I did charge as directed for the first time as well. You can plug it in directly but that kinda defeats the whole cordless design.<br /><br />It really starts to struggle with longer hair. Maybe this would work better if I used it every 2 weeks.<br /><br />This clipper does feel cheaply made.,2
3.0,"Service was great, product is ok.",2
3,Good,2
3,"My sister broke it in a week, but I guess that is to be expected since she breaks stuff in weeks. It could be more elastic though, but it looks great.",2
3,The two different loops should work better but it is underwhelming and does not really do what I expected. It,2
3.0,It's okay. Nothing out of the ordinary of what I already had. just in a kit.,2
3,"Bottle had leaked all over envelope, had to clean up bottle and wrap as it was a gift.",2
3,"The product arrived on time and was still in box/very nice.  The only thing I have been disappointed in it is that it is skinnier than I expected,  so my curls don't look as good as they could, and they tend to get frizzy.",2
3,"Razor provides a good shave, but not one that is exceptional.  Comfortable to use. Easy to clean.  One issue on the razor which arrived was that the stand charger that was in the package was apparently for a different model as the contact points on the razor and charger did not fit.",2
3,"It is a nice perfume. Sold at Barneys New York and very well recommended. However, I think older people will like better than the youngsters. Just a feeling.",2
3,I use these with my beeswax balm.  They do a good job for letting the customer know what they are buying and it shows the color well when they are interested in the look of the beeswax.,2
3,"Works more like a blush brush. It's angled and plush and soft, but it's too thick to make any kind of distinct mark on your face the way a &#34;contour&#34; brush is supposed to.",2
3,"This is your run-of-the-mill tanning lotion. It did okay, but I didn't get amazing color. It also has an unpleasant smell after you get out of the tanning bed. I won't be buying this product again. I probably would have been really pissed if I had thrown away $60 at the tanning salon for this product, but luckily I didn't waste too much money by ordering it on amazon.",2
3,"OK, but does NOT beat flossing with flossing string.",2
3,"They seemed to leak at first, but have apparently stopped leaking now.",2
3.0,"SMELLS NICE, BUT FADES QUICKLY.",2
3,"Unfortunately, in the package I received, 1 of the 2 bottles was broken when I opened it. That left me 1 bottle left to use. Overall, I enjoy the minty feeling on my face. In terms of helping my acne prone skin, I haven't seen a difference.",2
3,The product was ok. Seemed to be a bit old because it's a bit dry when applying.,2
3,"I have long hair, there is enough room and the elastic is snug enough not to let in water.  Would purchase again.",2
3,The protective seal was broken when my wife opened it.Not sure if it is safe/sanitary to use.,2
3,Decent product but not one to love! Avon must be run by some staid old board of directors or really young and in love with Spiderman... since they have no clue about how to make good decisions...... they cancel all the good stuff just in the name of changing!,2
3,Ok,2
3,should spend a lil more on packaging...my brushes were broken,2
3,It said it will smooth and change you skin texture and young feel....well it did not work. The only thing I like about it was the smell.,2
3,Not what I wanted or expected but still a good shear.,2
3,"I have no problems with this trimmer being that its my first. i dont know to much about trimmers in general but i do know that if your looking for a comfortable nothing fancy trim with less mess, then this is a good trimmer for you. But if your looking to sculp your facial hair into a flamingo perched in a pond with kermit, well then i'de have to say look somewhere else. This one was not design with precision in mind. To elucidate it's bulking so getting into tight areas is almost impossible without bending and flexing your face everywhich way. I like it though, i use it daily to keep my sexy 5'clock shadow trimmed mess free.",2
3.0,"In my experience, there are thin and thick versions of exfoliating gloves. I prefer the thick - these are the thin. They're fine for what they are, but if you want the thicker, more absorbant, luxurious gloves, you'll need to pay a little more.",2
3,"Had read some good reviews about it and decided to try. nothing spetacular, just normal. Will not buy again. ,",2
3,This was ok for the price but comes nowhere near Purology twist and texture I was wanting to find a substitute for. Don't think I will buy it again will have to save up and buy the real deal.,2

3,thank you,2
3,"Don't buy this; go to your local Dept Store that carries Fresh (like Neimans, etc) and ask for a sample.  The Fresh rep at Neimans gave me four of them.  $12/packet?  insane, i say.",2
3,"This bag is great.  I love mine and recieve many compliments on it.  However, I discovered that the price on Amazon is about $50 more than what the Disney parks or Disney online charge.  yikes.",2
3,I am not getting the close shave I was expecting.,2
3,"It cleans well but this cordless version has its limitations. You need to refill the water tank twice to do your whole mouth. Refilling is easy but when it runs out of water the pitch of the fairly noisy thing gets even higher and more annoying.   Also, because you need to keep it upright, there are parts of your mouth you can't get to, notably the inside of your front teeth where plaque accumulates. I'm going to return this and try the larger counter top size.",2
3,"Good, healthy ingredients, but it feels like vaseline. Thick greasy lotion isn't the most comfortable thing to have on your skin when sitting in the hot sun. Definitely increases the sweat factor. Probably could find an equally safe product that applies more comfortably.",2
3,The lotion made me tan however I think the smell is too strong and sometimes I would feel as though I was allergic to it because it would make me itch and left a rash on my arm. It could just be me though.,2
3,"so you probably know Pre de Provence soaps are amazing. Long lasting, moisturizing, exfoliating and smell great.I just wasn't crazy about this lime zest scent. Smelled like a harsh bathroom cleanser. I have no doubt that they used real lime zest for the scent, i guess its just not an ideal scent for &#34;luxury&#34; soap.",2
3,"Hey, it does what it needs to do.  I would buy it again, but I am a bit disappointed in the battery capacity.  When the readout gets to around 30, the motor starts to lose power, and when it his 28 or 27 at the lowest...game over, man.  I tried a couple deep discharge cycles to see if this would help, nope.  When it gets down to 28, it's dead.<br /><br />Still, this is easily enough to go a couple weeks between charges, so it isn't really THAT impacting, it just bugs my OCD.",2
3,"This was the first soap I tried from Lush. I don't like the bubble gum scent- it smells just like Extra original flavor gum- but this soap is really creamy and moisturizing. It lathers nicely and it looks pretty. So I might buy again because it is so soft and creamy on the skin, if I can get over the smell that is. I think younger girls would probably like this one.",2
3.0,"Smells really refreshing.  Didn't do a whole lot for my skin that I could notice.  Gives a nice clean feeling, not drying.",2
3.0,I think the issue is that this is the wrong iron for me.  This get super hot - coldest temp is 310 degrees.  So this is for people with really coarse or curly hair.  I have actually burned my hand on my hair while using it - so I don't use it around my little kids.  So don't get this if you have fine or thin hair - totally unnecessary,2
3,It's not work I expected.,2
3,This Mineral Fusion Mattifying Oil Control Facial Moisturizer controls the oil of my face better than other products that I have tried.,2
3,"Been using this for about a month, I seam to be loosing less hairs in the shower. Also a tiny bit of peach fuzz seamed to have grown on my temples. This is  by no means a cure for male pattern baldness, does seam to help a little bit though...",2
3,"I really like it, I usually use Salt Scrubs. Oh, this sugar stuff is much better. If you ever used salt scrubs then you know how they can burn if you have any nicks or cut on your hand, body, etc. Sometimes I'll forget and shave my legs, well then I can't use the scrub. With the sugar scrub you can use it whenever. I like that. The product itself is okay. I would like it if the oils were a little thicker, for lack of a better word. Overall it's okay.",2
3,I wasn't too happy about the pigmentation with this after reading the reviews everyone was saying the eyeshadow was very pigmented. Not true.,2
3,"I use a lot of E.L.F. products and I kept hearing good things about this, so I thought I would try it. It's nice nd I'm glad I purchased it. The colors are really pretty.",2
3,"OK, nothing earth shaking.",2
3,"Overall the bag is nice, a little different than expected.  Not sure if I would give it as the birthday gift that I purchased it for.",2
3,This product gives you four good sents for your everyday life.,2
3,Don't see much improvement. It was overrated...,2
3,"Some of these smell delicious, some are awful. I guess it's just a matter of personal preference. Also, some of the sticks burn up very quickly and put up a lot of black smoke.",2
3,strapes kept falling down when I wore it.,2
3,"I've been using this epilator for a few months and I can't say it is anything special. I only use it for my legs, and the hair grows back in 2 to 3 days, not 2 to 3 weeks. Prior to this, I used an Epilady coil epilator for several years (it finally wore out) and it did a better job, with about 2 weeks between uses. Maybe the Braun breaks most of the hairs instead of getting it down to the root. I don't know, but for my dark hair the Braun doen't work very well.",2
3,"It's comfortable and blocks light well, but tends to fall off as I move around in my sleep. Not worth the money.",2
3,good,2
3,"I purchased this because I have one crown that has a gap in it. It works great but it doesn't work on teeth with normal spacing or close spacing. In my case it won't even get through the teeth.  It's basically a thin piece of metal that's flexible. The design is good but needs some work.  I gave myself a \\""paper cut\\"" type slice on my lip when taking it out.  It would be much better if it were a thin piece of flexible plastic instead.  The metal bends and ends up with a permanent crease.  Plastic would retain it's shape and not cut as much.",2
3,"Came promptly, and I decided to take a sniff.  I did not detect &#34;baby powder&#34; aroma; just harsh citrus? smell.  Anyway, I wrapped it up and gave it to my paper delivery woman.",2
3,"I think these are a bit too big, I wish they were a little smaller because they have a lot of stretch to them. I love how I can use them to put wet hair in a bun and it doesn't leave a mark.",2
3,"I was looking for bath milk to make my bath more moisturizing and this was a steal of a price and had good reviews.  It is a nice product, it smells good--I don't find it cloying, the scent is very light.  And it makes a heck of a bubble bath.  But there in lies the problem, in order to have such nice bubbles the company has added ingredients like myristamine oxide and acrylates copolymer styrene.  If the company monitors reviews, I hope they'll reconsider some of these additions because they have a lovely product otherwise.  And yes, there's sodium laureth sulfate, but I'm not really bothered by this one.<br />Potential offenders and their possible reason for being there include:<br /><br />Acrylates copolymer styrene (solution binder)<br />Tetrasodium EDTA (makes hard water soft--accounting for the silky feel; it may also lead to more absorption in your skin, making it potentially hazardous)<br />Myristamine oxide (surfactant, used to stabilize foam--hence super bubbles)<br />Methylchloroisothiazolinone (preservative w antibacterial properties, skin irritant w longterm exposure)<br />Mtehylisothiazolinone (powerful biocide and preservative, can lead to dermatitis on hands)<br /><br />If you want something comparable in bathing experience, but with fewer bubbles and better ingredients, I highly recommend Hugo Naturals Baby Foaming Bath Milk, unfortunately it's much more expensive for a much smaller quantity.<br /><br />Folks at Alpen Secrets:  Please consider a reformulation, there aren't many bath milks on the market and even fewer \\""natural\\"" bath milks.  It would be super to feel comfortable buying and supporting your product--and yes, I would pay more for something w fewer questionable chemicals.",2
3,"I purchased these based on the &#34;Keratin&#34; name and the great deal! I love Pantene products, but these were not my favorite. Maybe they were too hyped up because of the description and the name. First of all, they smell INCREDIBLE! The size is really great for the price that you pay. These did make my hair smooth and shiny. However, it worked just as good as typical shampoo and conditioner, of other brands does. I have used other Keratin treatments and they completely amazed me. This one did not because it didn't leave my hair as soft and moisturized as I expected it to!",2
3,"Takes to long to dry, I prefer revlon in the tube with brush dry fast and clear. This product was ok",2
3,"This stuff is wonderful for toning. I use it morning and night usually immediately before I apply my organic moisturizer. When I don't, there's noticable difference. The creases across my forehead have almost disappeared and the lines and creases around my eyes are improving too.",2
3.0,"The dotting tools I received are exactly what I am looking for, but the nail art brushes did nothing. The brushes did not paint on any color no matter what brand of nail polish it was dipped into. No matter how deep within the bottle or anything similar to.

3,"I ordered the spray product of this brand, but was sent this. It wasn't exactly what I wanted, but not worth the trouble to return it.",2
3,I like it a lot ... Only thing I don't like  is sometime I feel like its too heavy to carry hehe,2
3,"Jury is still out on this one. My initial impression is that I love it - makes my skin so soft. I love the way my face feels the next morning. However, my chin has been breaking out since using it. This is a problem I've had on and off my whole life, so not sure if it's this product or something else. I've switched up a few other things in my routine to see if that helps the problem. I really hope it does because I want to like this cream, but need my chin to quit breaking out.",2
3,It is very hard on the skin.  My husband likes it but I tried it once and it felt like steel wool on my skin.  I guess it is made for men not woman.,2
3,Some hair growth but the side effects are too much to bear!,2
3.0,Works well but made my underarms itch after a month or so. Must be allergic to one of the ingredients.,2
3,"I am a Coach poppy blossom fan but had never tried the original poppy.  I was not keen on the idea of spending so much for the name brand until sure, so this was an inbetween.  Even though I was not fond of the smeel, I gave it to a friend, and she loves it so still a great product.",2
3,I didn't notice that this helped much with the blemish I have. It is just a dark spot on my face but the great thing about this stick as opposed to some of the other tea tree products I've tried is It doesn't smell horrible.,2
3,"Compared to the more expensive models, such as the Easy Clean and/or Healthy White, this Plaque Control model rattles loudly during usage. Motor works strong and cleans teeth the same, but it seems as though the plastic housing does not have the same build quality as the more expensive models.<br /><br />If you don't care about the loud noise, this model might be good for you if you are looking for a low-cost entry model.<br /><br />Pro tip: Target has a special edition model with various colors and free travel case for the same price.",2
3,"I like the glittery oil, but it smells like WD40 or motor oil.If you can get past the smell your doing good, I mixed it with other lotions to mask the smell and still get the glitter look.",2
3,"Having an oster wall mounted hairdryer in excess of 10 years , that had 3 speeds , it is a little difficult getting accustomed to a two speed model. ( this is what the newer ones are ) If this one lasts as long as the first one I will be  very happy",2

3,The fan brush wasnt as sturdy as I expected,2
3,"I bought this for travel. Too much of a hassle to pack the recharging stand that unfortunately has become part of most razors...the stands are made of plastic, too likely to break in a suitcase. For short trips, I can take my good razor and not have to worry about recharging....but anything close to a week and it's too risky to run out of charge.  So......I went looking for a razor with an electrical cord that I could just plug in.  To me, the cordless feature isn't that critical - sure it's nice, but it's not like I'm going for a walk while shaving.  The only way I could find to get a corded razor is to buy a leftover one from yesteryear.  This one works okay, but a far cry from the current models.  Too bad they don't offer a corded model with today's technology as far as heads, comfort, closeness, etc.  It seems they've fallen in love with the idea of (a) cordless and (b) having to make room for a charging stand that sits out on the vanity permanently.  Whatever happened to just plugging in the razor to charge it, like a cell phone?",2
3,"I went through a period where I tried several hair oils, from Moroccan oil to argan oil to coconut oil. I love Joico's other hair products, so I decided to give this oil a try. It has a light, pleasant smell and it isn't too runny or too thick. I blow dry my hair and style it a little while I'm blow drying. Once my hair is almost fully dry, I put a small amount of oil in my hand and rub it between my palms. Then I comb the oil into my hair with my fingers. This way, the oil gets applied to all my hair, instead of just the top layer.<br /><br />This Joico styling oil is good for styling hair. Sometimes, I don't need to use any other products but styling oil for my hair. It's a bit on the greasier side, and it makes my hair look a little oily, but compared to some of the other oils I've tried, it's not that bad. Overall, it's a good product, but there are better oils out there.",2
3,its a good product but the Glue was frozen and the mirror was broken upon delivery I think the packaging was not that great but the project is good besides the Glue,2
3,This is a great kit for beginners!,2
3,I like the second to none luminous foundation but it looks funny on the face. It only looks a little better if you add some liquid to it or something. I still prefer MAC. I think I would go back to it.,2
3,"Of the NOW oils I have in my collection, this is the least favorite.  It smells off from some reason, maybe I got this off a bad batch.",2
3,"Sulfur is the active ingredient. It goes from yellow to invisible when you apply it. There is only a slight whiff of sulfur if it is around your nose. The sulfur smell gets stronger when you shower it off. The product helps prevent the chemicals from forming to create acne breakout. It really doesn't dry up existing pimples, I use a different cream for that. I use this as a change of pace from my prescription roseca meds. Works okay for what it is intended. No miracle cure.",2
3,It is ok for the price but the chages in my color were subtle and my teeth were not too bad.,2

I have recently perchased this cologne for my boyfriend it smells so yummy but the smell doesn't last long at all give it 30 min to a hour and you have to spray it again. something you have to keep with you all day not worth the money, it wont last long. love the smell but no bueno that the smell doesn't last!!.",2
3,"I bought this lip liner in fuscia to go with my bright pink lipsticks.  The product itself just wasn't that great.  I am a die hard NYX fan but this is not one of their best lip products.  The color is really pretty but when I put it on it doesn't seem to show up as much as I would like it to.  It really doesn't glide on that easily either.  It is kind of hard so I have to push harder to apply it, resulting in a thicker and more uneven line.  If I could melt the pencil a little bit or something it might work a little better but i'm doubtful.",2
3,"I really enjoyed this hair dryer - it worked great but it only lasted a year and a half.  All of a sudden it just stopped working...what a huge disappointment.  I would think a hair dyer would last a while.  I also made a point to remove the lint but still...stopped working. Also, after a while the retractable cord would get stuck.  I'd have to play around with it in order to have it retract all the way.  Seriously disappointed!",2
3,"The stain itself it's alright but I've tried better stains, the Body Shop and Sephora ones are out of this world.",2
3,"They're decent tweezers, but nothing fantastic.  Gets the job done.",2
3,"Pros : Excellent moisturizer, without too much greasiness (once it soaks in).<br /><br />Cons: Maybe I wasn't supposed to take this internally, I don't know, but I did as part of a parasite cleanse and noticed it really seemed to stress my liver (light-colored stool). I only tried it twice this way, but both times it made me feel toxic, which is why I'm on the fence with 3 stars.",2
3,"If you havent tried them yet, and you are skeptical about the ingridients in this product, the price, or the results, I recommend you to try out the Country Life \\""Maxi Hair\\"" vitamins. I got mine from Super Supplements where I live and im sure most Natural Markets and other supplement shops carry them.<br />They are super affordable, I bought mine for around 16 bucks.<br /><br />My hair is long, thick and I was noticing a lot of breakage at the ends/brittleness, and just hair loss in general during my showers and hair styling/brushing.<br />My hair has been less brittle, even thicker, and even my eyebrows are filling out!<br />My Nails are without any splitting and they are about as hard as the acrylics. They grow very fast. Im pretty impressed, and the results came about quickly.<br />I was recommended these from the Lady that works the cashier at Super Supplements. She said they have great reviews and they have been the number one selling Hair, Skin, and Nails Vitamin that they sell.<br />I think ill continue with these vitamins for now.",2
3.0,"Good consistency, smells nice, and color is great for my very pale skin. But, the first day I put it on, within hours, I had several blemishes. By the sixth hour of wearing it, I had to thoroughly cleanse my face because off the irritation it caused. Be careful if you have very sensitive skin- this may not be the product for you.",2
3,"What I got isn't what I ordered, but I liked it enough to keep it.  I ordered the bronzing body butter, and got the coconut crushed pearl without the bronzer.  I really do like it, it just isn't what I was expecting...",2
3,"I suggest this cream for light pain , but does sooth the body with a very nice smell and is rich with aloe vera.",2
3,"I like that it is organic, but it has a lot of &#34;glittery&#34; look, and it was hard to get a color match (I must have gotten the wrong color), as I looked very pale after using it.",2
3,A little on the small side.,2
3,I ordered this after a beautician raved about it. I wasn't impressed - my hair does better on other products.,2
3,"I almost finioshed the bottle & truly don't see any difference. MAy be slightly even tone of skin. I used it exactly as it was mentioned: morning & evening. Sometimes you have burning warm sensation, sometimes not.<br />Stretch marks & cellulite is still there & visible. Will try another ramedy next time.",2
3,The on/off switch is in an awkward place so as you dry your hair you tend to turn off the hairdryer by accident.,2
3,"For what one spends on these, plus the wax, you're better off just buying nads.  Oh, and although they advertise these strips as washable, its of little concern as it takes some serious scrubbing to get the wax off.",2
3,"I had used Nivea Gel in Germany, while using the bottle were fully sealed with Nivea  wrapper,and while using there was no stickiness but the one I received used like some one has filled over here, and it sticks on hand.cannot say, it is suppose to be like a Nivea cream, not a sticky solution.",2
3,These things did not seem to work for me. All it seemed to do was make my nose really red. But they are worth a shot!,2
3,Good for guys who get those red bumps after shaving...an easy roll-on stick that does not leave a mess or sticky residue.,2
3,It's not what I thought it was going to be like.  What I smelled at the store was probably mixed with Halle Berry's new perfume.  Not really a good scent for young women.,2
3,They were cute but to small,2
3,I'm giving three stars because I haven't yet noticed any difference after three weeks. Really hoping to be able to upgrade this to five stars. I reevaluate after using the whole bottle. My hair stylist recommended this brand so I have some faith.,2
3,"My hair is very fine and thin and damaged from years of abuse, so the fact that this product isn't a \\""miracle-worker\\"" wasn't a surprise.<br /><br />It's a GREAT price, and it does come with a nice silk case, as well as a trial of leave in oil (which I have yet to try). It heats up quickly,and glides through hair easily.<br /><br />It doesn't give you that silky shine, but it definitely straightens and gets rid of a lot of the flyaways.<br /><br />I wish it had an automatic shut-off, but it does have a temp control knob, and that's nice.<br /><br />Overall, for the price, it's a nice product if you're looking for a quick fix for a straightener, but it's not the one I'd buy if I were looking for an investment flat iron.",2
3,Didn't work for me.,2
3,"Yes, the scent of this is great.  From the first time I put some on, my wife loved it.  Problem quickly presented itself when in the coming days after putting some on (3 squirts of the cologne), the smell seemed to be quite weak.  Other purchasers of this had mentioned similar concerns, but I thought there was no way Amazon would sell inferior goods or knockoffs.  I'm beginning to wonder now.<br /><br />Anyways, if you're looking for this particular scent, its hard to find (which is why I bought from Amazon).  If you do buy from Amazon, maybe the one you receive is legit and doesn't have the problem of fading quickly which mine unfortunately does.  Disappointing given all the years of purchases from Amazon, I've never encountered this kind of issue.",2
3,"The cream is really working to lighten up my spots. I was told it was a good product, and I am a believer.",2
3,"I bought this for coarse chin hair as well as facial hair in general. It got some of the finer chin hair but definitely not the chin hair. I can't use it on my lips, it hurts way too much.",2
3.0,"The product seems to be OK, but I was surprised to get the travel atomizer and not the small regular bottle. Also, the box did not have the sealed plastic wrapping that my other Ralph Lauren purchases always have. It made me wonder if it was legitmately Ralph Lauren.",2
3,I wanted a remington anti frizz straightner well I go to walmart and they had this one (I got the one w/ the bigger barrel since I have thicker hair)I used it and am happy w/ it. Haven't tried it on wet hair and not real sure I will it just doesn't seem healthy and alot of reviews say it takes a couple times and just makes it frizzer. Compared to my revlon 2in1 straightner it works way better. That thing was a piece of crap made my hair frizzer than before. Won't buy any revlon straightner one product ruins it for the rest. One thing that works awesome after is tresemme smooth no frizz shine spray (just don't use too much its a little oily and it just takes like one or two sprays) but my hair is shiny and smooth and it keeps frizz at bay,2
3,It's probably a great moisturizer but I'm not sure it is any better than any of the other ones I've used. I have gone back to my trusted night-time moisturizer but I'm using this for the little re-hydrating crisis that come around once in a while. It is just a little too pricey.,2
3,"The heat resistance was just what I needed to do my keratin treatments at home without burning my fingers or melting combs. With this glove I was able to finish with No burns! What I don't like is the size of the glove. I am average size, and I wear medium latex gloves. But this glove seemed to be extra large. All of the fingers were extremely long and it was hard to keep it on my hand properly. Because of this, I had to stop in the middle of straightening to tug and pull the glove back into place. So, good for heat, bad for women's size hand.",2
3.0,a regular small toothbrush would be just as good.,2
3,"China Glaze is a great brand. However, this color was not for me, but I would definitely use this product again in the future.",2
3,It's okay. too many chemicals for my kinky curly hair.,2
3,The price is the best selling point.  I have gad other buffers that did a better job.  It is uncomfortable to hold when using.,2
3,"Bought this to fix razor bumps/ingrown hairs on bikini line and underarms. It's worked in terms of preventing new bumps, but has not helped too much treat existing ones or to fade old scars. (I have medium brown skin and used the product for two months now).",2
3,Can not really be used with Gel colors.,2
3,"This is a very interesting green. it's kind of pale, almost milky,  with lots of green and yellowish micro-glitter. It's a very nice color but it in no way compares to the best green ever, OPI Green-wich Village. If you're looking for one green to have in your collection, I really suggest the OPI color.",2
3,"I put this on in the evening to moisturize my scalp before my morning shower, and it left some undeniable marks on my pillowcase.",2
3,"For the price, works great.  Very gentle, not as moisturizing as other overnight facial creams, but works pretty well, especially on sensitive skin.",2
3,"The last review is spot on about the color. It looks just like pepto bismol pink. Chalky baby pink. The worst part about this polish is that it will FADE over time.  It does not fade evenly either.  The overall color will lighten over the course of one week and after that you'll notice blotchy areas.  I would google search images of Go Girl, and you'll see what I mean.  No other Gelish I own does this except for Go Girl.  If you're looking for a color more similar to Go Girl, I would try \\""It's a Lily.\\""",2
3,It is not what ojon used to be... I think they changed the formula and reduced the amount of &#34;magic&#34; i have had in the past,2
3.0,"great smell, but makes my head itchy",2
3,"The brushes look good but upon opening the envelope, I found that one of the brushes was bent. Giving it three stars, may re-rate after usage.",2
3.0,Handle needs some ridges to keep from being slippery.,2
3,"Its chalk so ofcourse it was messy as expected but the color came out gorgeous. I took away stars becahse it took FOREVER to get it out of my hair when it was time to get it out. I had to wash my hair twice, 2 seperate days just to get it all out.",2
3.0,"Okay,I received my wig today. This is what I love about the wig. The color and the curls are pretty! Hair is very long, to my butt. It is very soft. Bangs are perfect length.<br /><br />What I dislike about it and the reason why I take off a star. The hair fall off easily. I only run my fingers through it, and hair already come off.<br /><br />And another reason why I take off another star. The wig get tangled easily. After running my fingers through it, the bottom half are already tangled.<br /><br />Overall, This wig is gorgeous but not for daily use. This wig will not work for someone that don't have hair, like me.",2
3,It helped a little but not much.,2
3,Ordered because of the Soap at Carrabas. However not the same Scent. Good but not Great...,2
3,"it is ok, according to my spectations.<br />I'd like to receive notices of special promotions.<br />thanks<br /><br />best regards<br /><br />Andrea Cabrera",2
3,"After 9 months of pregnancy and my skin being pushed to the max this has helped prevent me from getting ANY stretch marks. The only reason I cannot give it 5 stars is it has a very distinct smell that as a pregnant woman I could not handle. I had to mix in some lavender essential oil to try to cover it up and it still didnt get rid of it. I have no words to describe exactly what it smelled like, I can just tell you it was not appealing. If it gets cold it is as hard as a rock but at room tempurature it is like paste. Again, it did wonders for my skin, just wish it had a better smell to it.",2
3,"This product is so watery it doesn't stay on a scrub brush.  It doesn't feel like a shampoo because it doesn't suds up like a shampoo.  It's like putting colored water on your body and hair.  In this respect, Im disappointed.  It has a strong aroma of natural herbs, but the intructions say you have to leave it on for 30 min.  This is difficult as you can imagine doing.  So, I rather go back to the regular RID solution where you only need 10 min. max to leave it on.  Besides, RID is thicker and really is a shampoo, stronger and more effective.",2
3,I was disappointed about how little product there is in the tubes. There are barely enough for 3 applications so the price is kind of expensive for what it is.,2
3,"good lotion, but smells just like sun block. the whole reason for me to purchase this lotion was to have sun block on mt kids arm during the the day....with out smelling like sun block.. i wish they could change the odor to something more pleasent. i could have just bought regulat sun block, if i had known.",2
3.0,good,2
3,"I'm not as pleased with the product as I thought I would be.  I wash my hands a lot & therefore, they become dry.  Bar is difficult to maneuver over knuckles and is somewhat greasy.  The scent is great, but a little too great - very strong!  It is not the panacea I had hoped for.",2
3,"Quite honestly, the GIllette Fusion Proglide felt like just any plain no brand razor that can be purchased at any drug store. The packaging claims that the blades \\""glide effortlessly\\"" through hair but it was a slight struggle to do so, even when using with shaving cream. This honestly isn't too revolutionary although I will say that it does what it's meant to do; eventually get rid of your facial hair.",2
3,"I saw great reviews, and I saw those that said these break the nail. They are SO sharp that that they cut through nails as if they were butter, but the truth is they do leave you with mildly raggedy nails. I don't mind using a file, but I find myself going back time and again to grab a file. I'm thinking these probably aren't worth the price, given the ragged edges,",2
3,Good.  Headband is kind of tight. Wish tail had a better attachment to clothes. It fit everyone in our family.,2
3,"I was originally looking for the Tweezerman toe nail clippers but couldn't find what I was looking for. So, after reading all the good reviews for this product I decided to purchase it. To be honest, I expected more. I don't think the nippers are sharp enough, it's also hard to get into places with these (the corners of the toe nails). They do cut the skin around the nail very well, but for the price, I thought these would be sharper and easier in cutting the nails. It's an ok product, but I wouldn't purchase it again, nor, unfortunately i would recommend it unless it's to trim the skin around the toe nails. I'll continue to use them to justify the money spent but next time I'll purchase the ones by Tweezerman because those are really worth it.",2
3,Good product.,2
3.0,Nice,2
3,This came a week early which was great. they haven't broke off but they are kind off hard to do designs with.,2

3.0,I just felt clean with the soap. Mild changes to the dark area of my neck.,2
3,"I use sunscreens frequently and am concerned about possible health issues with most products. I purchased Loving Naturals because of its ingredients, which are possibly safer than other sunscreens.    The problem I've had with this sunscreen is that the zinc oxide particles are larger than in other products, which is why this is supposed to be safer (doesn't get absorbed into the body as easily), but the larger particles are visible. The result is that this isn't much different than using the old fashioned zinc oxide which was a greasy solid white coating that blocked the sun, but looked silly. Loving Naturals has a tan tint to it but when applied it's still basically white. I can deal with the white when I'm not going to be seen by others, but because this is a surface sunscreen that is greasy, any sweat on the face becomes very itchy and when you scratch, or just touch a covered area, the sunscreen is rubbed off which leaves little or no protection.    I really wanted to like this product but for me it is only of limited value. Because I do believe that it is healthier I will use it when working on my property where no one can see me, but I will have to keep a mirror nearby so I can check periodically to be sure none of it has rubbed off.",2
3,"I purchased one bar of this to see if I would like it, and to see if I would want to purchase more. After one use, I knew that I did not like it - I am used to a much larger, thicker bar of soap.  This shape and feel of this bar of soap reminded me of a bar of &#34;Safeguard&#34; - (a  brand that I used many years ago before I cared what was in the soap.)  Also, this bar did not lather up quickly like I like a soap bar to do. It is &#34;OK&#34; - I would certainly prefer it over brands that contain animal products and/or chemicals - but there are other vegan brands out there that I personally prefer over this one, just sayin'.......",2
3,"It helps, but is painful and does not get all the hair.  I prefer the creme hair removers.<br />Less expensive than buying creme removers over and over again.  Best for light hair removal needs.",2
3,"My aunt has this same exact blow dryer and hers worked perfectly. I ordered this one because mine went out. Well, it over heats and shuts off until it cools off. My aunts never did that to me. When it works correctly, you can really get your hair straigt fast with the combs.",2
3,"The product itself was working great.  Cleaned up the dry skin behind my husband's ears in a short time.  What was frustrating was the foam jammed the dispensing mechanism on the can and we broke the tip off trying to get the product out.  We looked up the mfg. (Promius(sp)), called them and they sent us a will-call pick-up tag from UPS to pick up the can so they could inspect it.  Long story short, 3 months later they sent us a refund check.  We have tried to shop this product but cannot find any pharmacy that carries it, or has even heard of it!  Concur with Hard to find.",2
3,I don't really care the product itself. I already have very curly hair so I need my curls to be &#34;enhanced&#34; and I can't notice a difference in them even when I apply it it damp hair. But the company's shipping was quick. . So that is always a plus,2

3,I remember Mr Bubble filling up the entire bathtub with bubbles before a few ounces of water actually accumulated at the bottom of the tub.  More like Mr. Soap Suds!,2

3,Price is too high especially with shipping. It is only a small bottle.<br />The smell is strong! If you don't like to attract attention ever now and then (esp. when you put it on fresh) it is not the right for you.,2
3,"aroma is not that good. Had expected more from FA, which I had thought of being a good soap company.<br />I think I will stick with Dove soaps.",2
3,"I like this because it would glide very easily. About halfway doe the stick, it started breaking off in little pieces no matter how much I modified my method of applying it. It's good for the price, but i prefer other brands.",2
3.0,"I have very wavy and coarse 3c hair.  I bought this product for use during the busy weeks when I need a ready-made leave-in (I typically create my own concoction of aloe vera juice mixed with this or that).  This product does not have any obvious negatives, like a strong scent or thick or sticky texture or anything, it's just unremarkable and not particularly effective as a curl activator (on my hair at least) - $20 or so.  I have used almost the entire bottle at this point, and my overall view is \\""eh, I've done better with my own mixtures...\\""",2
3,"I like the product very much. However, the packaging needs to be much better. The bottles were allowed to roll around in the box and 1 leaked a little and another one the pump top was broke in half - still usable.",2
3,I like this product for my hair.  I have curly fine hair and it gets frizzy on the ends.  This helps calm my hair and give it more control and more definition.  However I don't like the strong chemical smell.  It smells like something that would be in a cleaning product. So I am concerned that it may dry my hair out with extended use. I have used this product in the past and always liked it.  I don't remember it smelling like this though.,2
3,I bought these for my friends. There were no adhesive inside. I had to purchase it separate. But my friends do like them and they are wearing them.,2

3,"Product works great -- skin was instantly soft without feeling greasy.  But, I had a VERY different preconception of the fragrance of \\""orange blossom honey.\\""  I hate the smell of this lotion!  I can't imagine using this everyday, so it now resides in the guest powder room.",2
3.0,Okay stuff but the price is rough because for the under price of one of these I could get a 3pack of gastby which works just as good but this is some good stuff overall I wouldn't purchase this again tho knowing I could get 3x of gastby for a cheaper price and its just more too so its okay but not great holds the hair good and styles well dunno what else I would say bout this I would get it if it came with more but honestly gonna stick with gastby because gastby is just slightly cheaper and you get more,2

3.0,Fair,2

3,"Okay, so I used to be able to buy a fantastic Biore pore unclogging face scrub on the highstreet, but they've stopped stocking it, so I went on an online hunt.  On the face of it, this seemed to be the same stuff. It isn't.  I have only used this once, and whilst it warms the face and unclogs the pores I am concerned it will be too harsh for my skin.  The old version was much better; mild but extremely effective.  I will have to wait and see if this works out for me, if not, it will be another fantastic product abandoned because of changes to the ingredients that irritate my sensitive skin.  For anyone with sensitive skin, be warned.  Do not use other acne products when you have used this facewash, it will seriously dry out and potentially damage your skin. Be especially careful around your eyes, nose and mouth where your skin is most sensitive.  I really hope this product will be okay for me, and I really hope it works for other people.  I am disappointed that Biore have done what everyone else seems to do; go and change something fantastic that works wonders and ruin it by 're-formulating' it! Bad move Biore.",2

The mascara actually seems dry even first time out using.  Normally I get the Physicians Formula Lash Boosting Mascara which is what I will go back to as I love how it looks and application is even on every eyelash every time I use.",2

3,"I saw this color and I had to have it. I thought it was exactly the color I wanted. It looks like a darkish bright pink. But when I actually got it, I was a bit on the disappointed side. I wasn't sure what to expect exactly but it didn't pop like I wanted it to. It made my lips flake a bit. And the wand/applicator part came out of the black cap part when I first opened it, which is fixable. Just sort of annoying. But as long as I use a good moisturizing lip color in a slightly darker shade and apply the product on top, it does exactly what I want it to. This isn't a bad product, but I would really only buy it again in nudish colors.",2

3.0,"This shampoo is a mixed bag for me.  I love the way my hair feels after I wash it.  Although I didn't notice it boosting the shine factor, my hair was softer and bouncier.  And the smell is divine.  The problem I have with it is that after about 24 hours, my hair becomes so, so very oily, which has never been a problem for me before.  To continue using this shampoo, I would have to wash my hair every day and that is just not happening.  So sadly, this is a no go for me.  I would still recommend it to others, though.  My mom and nieces use it and don't have any problems.",2
3,"The product is great, but it is advertised as a 6 Pack and only one bottle showed up in the box.",2
3,The Amazing Grace Parfum Spray is stronger and longer lasting than the current spray fragrance but falls way short of the original non Coty owned Philosophy Amazing Grace Spray Parfum.  Note to Coty: Please bring back the old formula that made the old Amazing Grace spray fragrance equal to or better than the current Amazing Grace spray perfume.,2
3,"I ordered this lotion hoping that it would be as good as the lotion that I buy at the tanning salon, but it really isn't anything special.  I haven't noticed any difference in my tan.  It smells better, but as far as my tan goes, it hasn't made much difference.  But, for the price, I guess I shouldn't have been too surprised.",2
3,It's shampoo. It doesn't make my hair look thicker as advertised but it cleans it.,2
3,"I have 4a/b/c hair that is also porous.  For me, this product is hard for me to use.  When I apply it on freshly washed hair, I do not know how to figure out whether I used too much or too little.  When I apply it on dry hair, it merely sits on my hair and slides down on my forehead.  On the plus side, it smells nice.  I didn't experience any curl activating properties but it is great to use when applying with gel.  I guess I will pass this along to family members.",2
3,"Bought this about a month ago and had high hopes, but unfortunately it didn't work that great for my face. Broke my face out and I don't have sensitive skin. I'm assuming too much mineral oil or something.... I didn't want it to go to waste so I started using it on my body and it leaves it super soft and silky. Plus the collagen is a waste because (after researching)it doesn't penetrate the skin making it useless.....just sits there until you wash it off.",2
3,Nice product but not worth money,2
3,"not to be reused as many times, lost glue soon",2
3,"These plates are pretty good; the images on plate 01 were a bit too shallow to good lifts, but the others worked really well. The images are much prettier and crisper than I expected, and I like that as a whole the set aren't 'themed'--they'll work well for lots of occasions.<br />I'm also impressed that they came with a little vinyl/leatherette case, which was a classy thing to do. The stamper they included is nice and squishy but will need some buffing before using. The scraper has a metal blade but I prefer using an old gift card so I won't be using it anyway.  Overall, I'm very happy with the set; pretty good deal for the price.<br /><br />***Edit on 2/8/14: I wrote the above a few weeks ago; since then I've noticed a real problem I didn't really catch on to earlier. While the size of the full images is nice and generous, it seems that the patterns themselves have also been enlarged which means that you can't get a good patterned effect if you have average to smaller nails. This makes some of the images unusable, and this is true for both both sets. Some of the patterns have been enlarged so much that whatever parts you can fit on your nails will still leave you unable to see the full pattern. Plate 07 in set 2, for example, has an image of a crescent moon--there is no way the entire moon will fit on any of my nails.<br /><br />Still, most of the patterns work really well and I'm still happy with the purchase, but I'm taking off another star because of this issue.",2
3,Works good but really wanted the mod that plugs into the wall socket. I assume you don't make that one antmore,2
3,"I bought this one for my husband. We use &#34;everybody soap&#34; since a year. We use it for hand soap, shampoo and body wash. I've had citrus and mint, coconut and lemon, and the fruity one for kids. They were all very gentle, cleansing and had a nice smell. This one, however, they need to work on the scent. I know it's for men, but I couldn't really smell the cucumber extract and the blend of herbs and spices is not quiet pleasant. There is so many natural blends that works, this one doesn't for us, We'll use it for shampoo and hands not on the whole body...my husband is not going to go for it. The quality of soap is excellent, don't get me wrong. But maybe sandalwood and patchouli would be more appealing than the herbs or blends they used. Funny smell...Up to you, if you want to buy.",2
3,"Prompt shipment, carefull packaging.  This product was small enough to meet security guidelines for in-cabin luggage.   Product gives my hair more body.  Unfortunately there has been no increase in hair growth in the thinner areas.",2
3,"I bought this lotion with the intent of replacing my current daily facial lotion. As I proceeded to use this product over the next three weeks, I discovered that it was merely a firming sunscreen. It is hardly a lotion at all. I used this product around 3-4 times a week after I showered. Overall, I was not very impressed with it. However, Olay did seem to get a few things right with this product.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-This \\""lotion\\"" does indeed have sunscreen and it is not messy to apply<br />- One pump of the lotion is the perfect amount to cover your whole face<br />- The \\""regenerating\\"" claim of this product does seem to be mostly true. I found that my skin felt refreshed, tightened, and well taken care of within minutes of applying. I would say it has moderately improved the look and feel of my skin.<br />- Lotion does absorb rather quickly, which I thought was great.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- What I dislike most about this lotion is the fact that it is mostly sunscreen. It has the smell of sunscreen, the visual look of sunscreen, and the greasy feel of sunscreen that stays on your face hours after application.<br />- It takes a good 5 hours for my face to feel soft and smooth (and be rid of that greasy sunscreen feel).<br />- The sunscreen smell also takes about 5 hours to dissappear.<br />- I do not recommend applying makeup soon after using this product. Give it a good hour or two. Otherwise your makeup with not go on smoothly.<br /><br />Personally, this lotion did NOT work out for me and I will certainly not buy it again. I have learned that my type of facial lotion should be without any trace of sunscreen.<br /><br />But if you are the type who is seeking sunscreen protection AND some moderate skin repair... this is definitely worth trying.",2
3,"They look very fake. I tried and tried to make them blend, but they just wouldn't. They looked as cheap as a Halloween costume wig.",2
3,This product didn't do a whole lot for me.<br /><br />It does exfoliate gently...but I've had better results using a gentle Buff Puff.,2
3,don't expect to much but it does work to a degree...if it were half the price I would buy a box,2
3,"the glide part is great, the 3 stars are because there is little to no tension on the floss.  Still works, just not a title floss pick.",2
3,I like the smell of Versace Bright Crystal but every single woman knows about it and has smelled it before. Must be popular but I HATE smelling like everyone else. I think many perfumes smell similar to this one- which is the reason for it's success.<br />I don't love it but I don't hate it.,2
3,"This is OK, but not like I remember it.  I don't know if they changed this or what, but not like I remembered it smelling.  Will not purchase again.  Sorry.",2
3,"I really am torn about this product. Up until a week or so ago it did an amazing job at clearing up my acne on my forehead. This was after a couple weeks of use, twice a day on average.  This seemed to be a great solution for probably 6 or so weeks.<br />However, now my acne is even worse, it has spread all over into a ton of little zits, where as before they were larger and more sporadically placed.  I mean, my forehead is suddenly just covered in these things.  It's upsetting.  There is nothing else I can attribute causing this. I haven't changed any other product or aspect of my lifestyle that would make sense.  I've never experienced this ... so I'm wondering if it helped me at first but then created some type of reaction.  Has anyone else experienced anything similar?  I've only seen 1 other review that stated it made their acne worse so I am weirded out.<br />Sighhh, very frustrating, I was so happy to have seen an improvement.<br />I have started using the soap less now, pretty much discontinue at this point, and have given in to &#34;differins&#34; cream which I am hoping will help.  I just hope my condition doesn't continue to worsen at the same rate, otherwise it will become unmanageable. I've already become self conscious about my skin again.  It is so frustrating to not know the cause and not have control.<br />I would love any input.<br />Thanks and I hope you have a more consistently positive experience!",2
3,"I bought this hair dryer solely because of the price and the reviews. It is pretty nice for the most part, but my comb attachment has become weak already. I want to say it became weak on maybe like the 5th use, I am not sure since I was sharing it with my little sister. I myself have only used the dryer about 4 times. I can say though that it was bound to happen because of the way the extensions attach. They could have came up with a a better way of doing that. Other than that I like it, I haven't returned it because it still works for the most part. But i would rather attaching not be so weak so that this can be kept for a while.",2
3,"I swim a lot so I like to use some extra conditioning to protect my hair from the chemicals.  This leave-in spray is pretty good as a conditioner, but I found that it weighs down my fine hair a little bit too much.  It did make it nice and shiny and conditioned, but my fine hair is fussy about what I put on it and this just didn't completely satisfy me.  I will continue to use it though on occasion because it did find some benefit.",2

3,"This shampoo isnt my favroite, but it does its job i guess. It leaves my hair really clean, just not really moisturized or  manageable. Also i found the smell to be kinda smilar to cough medicine. I like tea tree oil, but i guess next time ill try a different tea tree oil shampoo. Not for me.",2
3,"I'm very happy with how well this product removed black dye from my hair and how gentle it was. I was left with a shade of orange I kind of liked, but decided to tone it to something more normal. I carefully followed the instructions of rinsing and scrubbing thoroughly and washed my hair 3 times with clarifying shampoo. I mixed up the ash blonde dye I had picked out and put it in my hair. Within about 3 minutes, my hair was dark again! I washed it out ASAP, but I was left with a very unattractive, muddy brown:( Even though I followed the process to remove all the dark molecules from my hair, but the developer in the ash blonde activated the molecules that were still in my hair. I bought some more, but have not been able to get back to the orange I liked. I'm too afraid to add more dye. Bummer.",2

I can use the clipper/attachments but the clippers are a little to big to get around the nose/ear area! The clippers do well on shaving my head and being cordless works great. I would say more like a 3 1/2 to 4 star, but still rather ticked that they would not include trimmer attachments!",2

3,"After pondering what the others said about this setter, I'm rather confused with what I must be doing wrong. I rather like most about the setter, but my problem is that I can't seem to get the roller clamps to hold the rollers in place. The rollers flop forward so give me a curl going the wrong direction, and sometimes the roller just falls out of my hair. It's fast and it curls very nicely and quickly. I'd love to know the answer to my dilemna.",2

3.0,"I wish this had worked out better because I love clip-less rollers (and having a roller option vs. irons) and it looks like fun. It didn't live up to it's promise though, having enough minor issues from start-up to comb-out that my rating is just &#34;okay&#34; vs. &#34;I love it.&#34;<br /><br />Either the heat indicator on my unit is broken or Conair needs to work on making them all better because it never turned on that I could tell, so the only way I knew the rollers were ready to use was by touching them during the warm-up period. I guesstimated that they were good to go at around 5 minutes, which seemed about right. For longer or thicker hair, hotter rollers might be better (I have fine, shoulder-length hair).<br /><br />If you're a pro at sectioning, rolling and pinning it may not be as much of an issue but the way Conair designed the unit, with the plastic cover you have to twist open over each roller area, is clunky and hard to deal with one-handed. It doesn't slide smoothly and there's no easy way to get to both size rollers with one hand other than picking up the unit and turning it around and if you're alternating sizes...you can see why this is a problem. The rollers also tended to close when I put them back on their pegs to reheat so I'd have to pull them back off, open them, repeat (usually more than once).<br /><br />As I said, I have pretty fine hair and when I use rollers, I like looser curls so I use thicker sections of hair. I use every single one of the 12 rollers and still could use another 4 or so to cover my head. Once I unroll the first section, it takes another 5 minutes of reheating the rollers again before I can use them to finish my hair. I don't get any volume near the top of my head from these rollers - I get great concentrated curl near the bottom though - so I'm still using the root volumizer attachment on my flat iron for that. The first time I used these without the iron, I ended up with what my kiddo called The Harry Styles which wasn't what I was going for.<br /><br />The final thing I wish Conair would address (which didn't affect my rating since it's more of a wish) is that the rollers are very short. There's only about an inch or so of usable roller area when you factor in the space needed to close it and that's not enough to get a reasonable amount of hair sectioned off and rolled to the scalp.wasn't what I was going for.<br /><br />The final thing I wish Conair would address (which didn't affect my rating since it's more of a wish) is that the rollers are very short.

3,"the description said they were a &#34;Pack of 10 pink&#34;. There were 5 pink and the rest were assorted colors. Not a big enough deal to get huffy about it, but I wanted all pink puffs. Besides the color, they serve their purpose. They haven't fallen all apart yet, so good enough.",2
3,Definitely is a very good toothpaste. Good cleaning but not sure teeth are any whiter. May have to see how it goes after several more weeks. No problems with the taste of either am or pm.

3,"I normally buy the Goody girls elastics at the store, but saw these and thought I'd give them a try for the amount you get.  They work pretty well, but they are super stretchy so you have to wind these things around a pony tail a bunch of times compared to others I've used...this can be a problem when you are doing a little kids hair as you don't have much time.  I think they will work ok, but I will probably switch back to the others once I finally work through all 3000 of these :)",2
3,"I use this product about once a week... I'm not exactly sure if it does anything. It doesn't make my skin look any better or worse, it just sort of is whatever.  I've put it on a few incoming pimples, but have also layered on BP and it seems to do the trick. I think it's mostly the BP working, though.  If you can get this for cheap, I'd recommend it because it may work for you.  If you think it's expensive, skip it.",2
3,"I believe that the hair may have been reduced but it wasn't like the description.  I applied the product immediately after waxing and twice daily throughout the next week.

While it was easy to put on and didn't harm the skin, I didn't feel like it was worth the price.",2

Smells like something my father wore back in the 70's. Not bad, just dated. Don't bother buying it. There's plenty of better fragrances out there.",2

Maybe I'm just not used to waterproof mascara, but Im not a huge fan of this. HOWEVER, I highly recommend the regular falsies flared!",2

3,"I'm a 31 year old male. My girlfriend pretty much lives with me so I thought I'd get her a bottle of her own body wash. The reason I went with Burt's Bees is because theirs products are known for being 99%+ natural.<br /><br />I've read a lot of reviews about this body wash being a bit &#34;watery&#34;, which is true. If you're expecting something with the same consistency as, let's say, Old Spice or Dove Men body wash then you'll be disappointed. It's almost as &#34;runny&#34; as baby oil, maybe a tad thicker. The downside to this is that you have a harder time pouring it out which means you'll probably use more than is necessary, so this 12-ounce bottle won't last you very long.<br /><br />Another common complaint is the smell. It does NOT smell &#34;bad&#34; like other reviews have mentioned. It literally smells like ginger with a strong hint of grapefruit after you lather it up. If anything, it smells pleasant. It totally helps wake you up because the smell is very citrusy. It doesn't have the same effect as smelling salt but it does give you a slight kick.<br /><br />This body wash won't leave your skin dry which is a plus. It actually makes it pretty smooth and you absolutely feel clean after. If you don't mind the runny consistency and citrusy scent, go ahead and give this a try.",2
3,"I've used a number of brands of shea butter over the years, but this is the best I've ever bought. The texture is incredibly smooth, not grainy at all, and the smell is very mild and pleasant. I appreciate that the company goes to such lengths to ensure that the vitamin content is protected as well as possible (it works so much better than the processed stuff!), and I will definitely be buying more when I run out.<br /><br />UPDATE: A year or so later I ordered some more, and this time it was very grainy. I'm not sure if it got overheated during transport and changed the texture or what, but it's not the amazing smooth shea butter I got before. It still melts as you massage into your skin, but the graininess is unpleasant and takes longer to melt than usual.",2
3,This is my husband's signature fragrance so of course we love Hugo. This review gets a three-star b/c when the 5 oz bottle arrived the packaging was without the plastic wrapping. The box looked a little worse for wear. I was not too sure why. The bottle was full though and the fragrance is authentic - it smells right and lasts as long as it should. May be it was some kind of overstock item but amazon did not specify that (if it is indeed the case) when I placed the order online.,2

I noticed one reviewer mentioned the coconut papaya soap and rose water so I'm about to look into it.  Also I don't put the soap directly on my face either.  I lather it up in my hands and apply it that way.<br /><br />I'll use the product for a few weeks and then I'll come back with an update.  By the way the soap smells wonderful.

3,"[[VIDEOID:mo1A57D6S3V5PTO]]In the accompanying video, I put Nyx's Eye Shadow Base and the Too Faced Shadow Insurance to a head-to-head test, using one product on each eye. I much preferred the creamy texture of the Nyx product to the thin, liquid texture of the Shadow Insurance. I also much preferred the Nyx pot to the Shadow Insurance tube. I felt that the Nyx cream in the pot allowed me better control of how much product I was putting on and where.<br /><br />When using shadow over each base, it appeared that Shadow Insurance provided a more intense, pigmented appearance to the shadow, but it wasn't a landslide victory over the Nyx.<br /><br />My eyelids are super sensitive to a lot of cosmetics, and neither product bothered me very much. I am also very fragrance sensitive and neither product bothered me in terms of fragrance.<br /><br />In terms of adjusting my makeup during or after application (if I made a mistake or wanted to adjust something), I found this very very difficult to do with Shadow Insurance and a bit easier to do with the Nyx Shadow Base. I know a lot of people love Shadow Insurance for its long-lasting properties, but I would rather be able to have a little wiggle room in adjusting my look than have a long-lasting look--that's just my preference.<br /><br />I didn't find a huge difference in the staying power of these products, but I think the Shadow Insurance had the edge.<br /><br />In terms of price comparison, the Nyx Eye Shadow Base is nearly half the cost of Too Faced's Shadow Insurance, though the amount of product you get is not different enough to warrant the cost, in my opinion (the Nyx product is .21 ounces and the Too Faced product is .35 ounces).<br /><br />In summary, if what is most important to you is that your makeup stay in place for many hours after you apply it and you're expert enough to not have to make many adjustments to your look, the Too Faced Shadow Insurance is probably your best bet. If, like me, you prefer a creamier, easier to use product that is more forgiving of making adjustments, I'd recommend the Nyx Eye Shadow Base. If I would buy either product again, it would be the Nyx Eye Shadow Base.<br /><br />Note: I have amended my rating from 2 to 3 stars as I realized that it was unfair and misleading to give the product 2 stars; it's not that the product is bad (obviously not, as many people rave about it), but it just isn't my preference.r, easier to use product that is more forgiving of making adjustments, I'd recommend the Nyx Eye Shadow Base.

3.0,It's nice it doesn't spin..I thought for all most 50$ it would spin but my face is cleared up nicely so it's fine.,2
3,"I love the product inside the bottle and the glass bottle itself, but the pump sprayer quit working and I had to pour the toner into my hand and apply.  Well there went the spritzer effect I bought it for.  And too much product is wasted.  I contacted the company about it and they told me they didn't have any extra spray tops, sorry.  That was it.  Talk about poor customer service.",2
3,"I rated it a 3 because I like it, but because of my skin being so oily, I can barely use it. I will be using it more during the winter, because my skin dries out then and hopefully it will make my skin an even tone. Other than that small issue, it was shipped and arrived on time, and in perfect condition. If you do not have very oily skin I would recommend it for you, but if you do, don't use it. :)",2
3.0,It broke right away. Very bad quality but I'll give it 3 stars for the prize.,2
3,My hair dosent get any soft with this not even if a leave it up to 10 minutes and even masage it... what is true is that when i blow dry my hair after using it my hair looks stronger but llack of shine...,2
3,The size is good and it's just as if I bought it from a rep only cheaper but it's nothing special for a moisturiser.,2
3,"Beautiful, but 8 cms long & kind of soft grip. The colors are excellent for dyed hair. Goog for long & straight hair",2
3,The brush iron heats well and would work good if the bristles were longer.  I know they break off if they're longer but I'd rather have that than the way they are.  It just doesn't work well with the hair.  I've tried another brand but it was the same.  Very disappointing.,2
3,"I wanted to like this.  I'm instantly attracted to any beauty product that says both &#34;anti aging&#34; and &#34;mattifying.&#34;<br /><br />I will say, this does not dry out my skin.  So the moisturizing aspect of the name seems to hold up.  You can see the full list of ingredients if you scroll down the product page.  The hyaluronic acid and aloe are certainly going to have some moisturizing and anti-aging (i.e., plumping or anti-wrinkle) effects.<br /><br />But, this product is not mattifying on me.  At all.  It's not so bad if I apply it after just washing my face.  But a few hours into the day and my T-zone is shiny and I have to use 2-3 blotting papers just on my nose and forehead (even though I'm also wearing foundation and finishing powder).  So this really doesn't control oil long-term, at least not for me.  (I tried it every morning for a week, under makeup.)  It's too bad, because this seems to have very good ingredients.  And it certainly will work for some people.  But it is definitely not right for me.",2
3,"This is too soapy for my preferences.  makes me feel like i should wash it off, unlike some other wipes out there that are more liquidy (probably due to alcohol.......)",2
3,"It is okay for a quick lift, but doesn't dry sufficiently. Brush is very soft. I still need to use my traditional hairdryer.",2
3,"It's main claim is skin whitening. My skin did not whiten. It is, however, a nice soap (it leaves the skin feeling soft and is ideal for sensitive skin). I did notice it helped reduce acne. It did not get rid of my acne but helped to reduce it. Overall, a nice soap but did not fulfill it's main purpose - to whiten skin. PS. I used both soaps to their entirety.",2
3,"Even though it looks very good, it is not quite as useful as I expected.   It is barely holding its own weight in your hair, no hope for holding a little part of hair in place. In other words, it is not a pin at all. It is just a piece of jewelry that you can (with a little bit of thoughts) figure out how to attach to your head.   Again, it will look nice.   It is more like a brooch then. And with a weak clasp.    The materials not look too cheap or something, but the designers idea on how it should sit in place was not the best anyway.",2
3,"It's ok, but smells like your average knock off at your local big box store.  Nothing unique or special about it.",2
3,"I have mild scalp psoriasis and have pretty much tried everything under the sun when it comes to shampoos.  Unfortunately, this shampoo did not work for me.  It did, however, leave my hair squeaky clean and the scent leaves an earthy/herbaceous smell.",2

3,"Scent is nice but only seems to last an hour or so, then I can't detect it any longer. Going to test on something I'm not wearing to make sure I'm not just getting so used to the scent that I can't detect it, but my other cologne I can still smell the next morning from just one spray (it's not strong or overbearing, just long-lasting, seemingly unlike this).<br /><br />I've seen warnings about possible fakes, but my bottle has the sticker and serial number on the bottom that I've heard is indicative of the real deal.",2
3,NICE SMELL BUT I GOT NO COLOR FROM IT.,2

3,This was a gift I can not tell you anything about the product since I do not own one.,2
3,Not the best sleep mask. Use bedtime bless instead.,2
3,Really don't have a review because the bottle leaked when received. A present for my mother and only found out about this recently.,2
3,"I like the size of this wand, it's considerably longer than the short, more expensive own I last owned. However, it does not heat as high as the 400 degree ones, & so I have to leave it in my hair a lot longer. Otherwise it works well.",2
3,Nothing life changing. A light facial moisturizer.,2
3,"I have some experience under my belt now with sulfate free shampoos, co-washing, WEN, etc. My hair is definitely improved from 6 years ago when I still washed my shoulder length dry coarse wavy hair daily with sulfate shampoos that claimed to be mild. Ha Ha. The search has been on ever since for realistically priced, no-hype products.<br />I tried this recently and while I think it is OK, I wonder why I should use this instead of even much cheaper conditioners like VO5, not marketed as co-wash products. Is there an advantage?<br />I have gravitated toward less and less actual washing my hair, even with sulfate free products. This has only helped my hair, which has never looked greasy a day in my life. And I used L'Oreal conditioning cleanser yesterday. But today, after using this in the morning, I find that my scalp is still wet at 6 pm and my hair/scalp feels a bit gummy. Mind you, my hair looks fine. But I am coming to the conclusion that these conditioning cleansers may not live up to the hype, even though they are much cheaper than Wen.<br />In my parents generation, many women went to the hairdresser once a week to have their hair &#34;done&#34;. It sounds so old fashioned. By contrast,  my generation was brought up to think you have to do something to your hair every day. But maybe you don't!!<br />Perhaps less is more.",2

Granted, it's better than most I've come across in the USA.<br />Pros: Precision made and seems durable.<br />Cons: Slippery in hand, and has an annoying pointed end that pokes you when using.<br />  Possibly due to the handling issue,it doesn't completely finish a cut of the nail, leaving a shredd to further remove.<br />I've had cheaper Trim models that almost equal the Seki precision cut, and handle better. If this model wasn't so &#34;trim&#34; it would be a winner. Maybe for younger females,not over 55 folks.",2
3,"I ordered this to replace an old Sonicare toothbrush. My fault I suppose for not reading the specs carefully, but I assumed all Sonicare toothbrushes had the 30 second timer. This one does not although it does have the 2 minute timer. Disappointing.",2
3.0,"I have used the Remington Keratin therapy dryer for one month.  I am not convinced about their spin on Keratin Therapy Keratin Ring.  How does one know if this enhances one's hair  and it is not clear how long the keratin itself is working.  The hair dryer itself is easy to hold although it would not be easy to take traveling. It is too bulky to pack.  There are many options in terms of cold, cool, warm and a \\""cool\\"" shot button depending on your hair style and type which offers flexibility of use.  One feature that I really  like is the ability to take the air filter off and clean the dust out. If you want a hair dryer at home this is very adequate but if you want a hair dryer to use at home and take traveling, this may not be the product for you.",2
3,"I'm not the thriftiest person and I don't mind spending a bit of extra money to spoil my hair, so I figured trying Wen wouldn't be so bad. It arrived promptly on time and smelled fantastic right off the bat. So naturally i was eager to try my new product out. This is wash two and I'm more than mildly dissatisfied. My hair after the first lashing wasn't rich and soft, it started feeling dry and a little coarse. Now at the second washing, my hair that I could once finger comb and be done with for the ay needed a sty in conditioner and to use a good amount before my hair started to cooperate. I'm returning this immediately, I am sad to say.",2
3.0,"Great coverage, but ended up making me break out after awhile. Very hard to remove even with makeup remover. Perfect for pale skin.",2

3,"I got this color by accident with a bulk order of Gelish polishes. I decided to give it a try, but it's so frosty and streaky that I feel like it looks messy, even when painted on perfectly straight. The super frosted base makes streaks with every brush stroke; you can see them clearly in the customer images, even from a far away glance. It reminds me of the bottle of Revlon rose frost nail polish that my mom and grandma used to wear in the 90's. It just looks old.<br /><br />This is my personal opinion, of course, and some people LOVE this color. It's just not for me. I will say that the formula is a nice concistancy to work with, and it gives good coverage. The rose color has an almost brownish orange hue to it, making it much less 'purple-y' than the swatch shows on the monitor.<br /><br />I hope this review helps both people who love frost (so they can snatch up this polish) and those who hate frost, like myself (in which case they can run for the hills).",2
3,meh,2
3,"(see the pun there...<br /><br />I don't care for the strong smell of this product's &#34;Fresh Scent&#34;, but it was cheaper than my regular brand is in the stores.  I can live with the strong scent because of the price (Yes, I know I'm cheap).<br /><br />Oh, it works fine too...I've not had a problem with deodorant failure from this product. As long as it stays less expensive than my regular brand, I'll continue to use it.",2
3,Prefer the ones others talk about from the kiosk / mall.  They seem to hold up better than this one.,2

3,"I received the polish within the expected time frame. The quality is great and it lasted for about a week and a half before it started to chip. However, the color isn't as exciting as I had hoped. It is really just a basic sparkly gray. I thought this color would be unique, but it wasn't that special. If you're looking for a nice sparkly gray color, though, this is for you!",2
3,When I saw the other reviews I thought I was going to become addicted to this product butI haven't is okay and I get very bad drandruff with it. It does thinkicking and give you voulume but you have to wash your hair the next day .,2
3.0,works pretty good,2
3.0,It's just another average drugstore eye cream. I used it during the day under make up and it works fairly well for that purpose. Don't think it'll provide enough moisture as a night time cream.<br /><br />Consistency is not too thick or thin so my under eye concealer does not slide thru.,2
3,"Purchased this because I just got braces.  It does an OK job, but, the hardest pressure isn't really that hard.  The different heads are nice to have, but, for the money, it is OK.  It is pretty loud when the motor is on, but, I am not sure how to compare it to others because it is my first one.",2
3,I can't say that I have seen any difference from using it so that is disappointing.  I still use it though.  I gave it a 3 because there is no odor which is nice and it does not cause flaking as some products do.,2

I have been doing this off and on, and I do not notice much of a difference between standing under a warm shower that bathes my closed eyes and using the wipes or not using them and/or doing the warm compress plus wipes exercise.",2

I wore it for like a couple of hours and then it broke, the flower part came from the other part so that was disappointing but its pretty  and it looks good on(for the couple of hours that i was able to) lol now im gonna see if i can glue it back together or something",2
3,"I bought this and used the entire bottle up. Its very silky and smells great, like oranges. When I put it on, it kind of feels like a weird film on my face. It didn't feel like it absorbed, like I could scrape it off afterward. Didn't care much for the texture. I also didn't notice any change in my skin texture or pores or wrinkles. I want to try something else.",2

3,"i have yet to get these strips to last more than 6 days, but im working on it. i hope its just my application skills that need improving, because this will be a lifesaver if i can get it to last 10 - 14 days. i have found that they go on smoother when the weather is warm, but they also tear easier.someone else suggested putting tape around the mouth of the gel and you probably should do that. the gel seems to build up or something around the rim and it becomes hard to close completely. such  a great idea that i will keep trying...",2
3,Does the job but not great! I had a better one 4 years ago from the same brand... it was much better quality.,2
3,"I liked this shave cream, but it was so thick that I had to use a ton of it every time I shaved. The whole bottle only ended up lasting me a few weeks.

It did moisturize my skin very well, and I saw less razor burn with this as compared to other shave creams I've used.",2
3,"Received product fast. Black light is so small it was difficult to use with a classroom. We used a box with holes in it for the kids to put their hands into. However, the lotion did not really show up this way. We ended up using Glo-Germ powder that someone else had.",2

3,I love makeup so this was really fun to play with.,2
3.0,Too small. Gave away,2

When curling my hair, I could not get the strands to stay on the biggest curl part of the wand and they would slide down as I was adding hair which resulted in lack of space for the full strand of hair I was attempting to curl. I'm thankful for the glove included. I would probably prefer the old curling irons overall.",2

My legs were left smooth and silky. Second shave same results. By the third day however the olay strips were very sticky and falling off. I keep my razor out of direct shower stream, but it does hang in the shower. I was disappointed as I don't think these would be worth the cost for falling apart so easily. keeping the razor outside the shower is to much of an inconvenience for me personally.",2

These Excel cartridges are supposed to be better because of the rubber strip in front of the blades, which supposedly smoothes the skin to prepare it for the blades.

3,I hate to bash products but im honest. It took too long for.the item to be.shipped. And the product smells okay. It has a minty foot scrub smell. With.fb if you put it on it will dry fast but it doesnt last all day.  Nor does it work at all under your belly for us big guys. After the day is over with you are left with mild sweaty balls and flakes in your underware. This product is only good if you are fresh out the shower and about to get freaky and you wanna be fresh for the moment.  For the moment yes it works but for guys that  sweat more then others this will only be good to try it for your self. Is it worth the try?? Yes.  They just need a stronger formula and different scents to chhose from.,2
3,I bought this on recommendation from my teenage niece.  I think the lotion is OK but I could not get past the smell.  It has a strong vanilla scent that I don't care for and it is very oily.  I felt like it was rubbing off on everything I touched.,2
3,Ive had this about a year and have tried so hard to love it  has to be mixed with ANOTHER lotion for it to even look normal.... Def nicer than some other tanning products I've used I just feel for that price you shouldn't have to mix it with something,2
3,Smaller than expected.. Kinda cheaply packaged.,2
3.0,"Doesn't come with a lid and the top curves out so lids for my other wax containers won't fit, even with the scrap bar removed. You have to be careful using the scrape bar b/c it tends to want to pop out when using it. The bar also gets messy and you have to break off the wax as it dries to it or it's not very good for future scraping. All in all, I think it works the way it's supposed to, but it just seems like more of a hassle for me. Prefer a regular wax can with a lid. Wouldn't buy again.",2

3,I enjoyed the product until I noticed I was breaking out a little bit and having some itchy patches on my face. On a positive note it's a serum so the consistency is like aloe very gel that is watered down. It's clear and does not have a strong fragrance.  It feels cool when applied to skin. I have received this product to test from Tomoson. This review is all on my own.,2
3,"I have used this sunscreen many times before, though never purchased from Amazon, usually from Specialty stores. Never had a problem with the sprayer.

The other is very touchy as to when it will spray. Sometimes it sprays, sometimes it gets stuck. Great sunscreen, bad spray bottle.",2
3,"Jean Nate is now stronger, not the light lemony fragrance of older days.  I do still like it, just not nearly as much. Tried adding some rubbing alcohol....maybe that will lessen the stronger fragrance.",2
3,"I'm a  big fan of elf products but this one is tooo light. I'm a pale person but this is just way too light. I don't know what it's supposed to do either. I put it on after my foundation and it did nothing really. I tapped as much of the powder off as I could before applying and it still was too pale. Maybe I'm doing something wrong but I just don't get this.<br />Thought it would be good for a powder cover. Not cover much but mostly oil control. I'm not oily but the foundation is. The thing is it's TOO light. I can't use it. If anyone knows how to actually use this,, maybe I'm just makeup challenged, I just don't get it. I'll stick to my covergirl powder for now.",2
3,it clugs the lashes so they look all sticky. after a while the mascare starts cheaping and falling on the face.,2
3,My hair which is fine and curly got really badly damaged by a hot iron.  I read the reviews of this and people seemed to love it.  It did not work that well for me at all.  I did not feel like my hair was softer or coated after using this product for an intensive treatment.  I even tried combing it through and sleeping with the masque in and rinsing it out the next day to no avail.  It smelled really nice as most panted products do.  I found Fekkai way more pricey but the intense treatment worked miracles.,2
3,Works O K.  Have to work to make the white stay on the nail but I use it just to keep underneath my nails cleaned out when they get dirt under them.,2
3,"This powder makes your face shaped and it definitely works, the only problem is it's shimmery so it was some fall out and also if you have acne prone skin like me it makes you break out.",2
3,"This Item has changed somewhat, the fragrance potency has a weaker scent, not like my previous order.  It smells different.",2
3,Smells great but only for short duration.,2
3,Hate the smell so I do not use it much but I suppose it makes a difference.,2
3,"But perhaps user error is blocking me from enjoying these as much as I should. I want a smooth bump of hair in front of the combs, and then the rest of the hair to be held back (say, from off of my face.) But instead, I get a weird curl of hair with little control, and the rest of the hair just sort of curls around the comb. I'm sure I'm doing it wrong but the internet isn't teaching me how to do it better, either. Perhaps my hair (which is growing out) just isn't long enough?<br /><br />Anyhow, these seem pretty sturdy, and they come in a nice assortment of colors. Wish me luck as my hair grows out, perhaps I'll get the hang of a nice comb-application.",2
3.0,"Great for Halloween, but super hard to manage and keep untangled.",2
3,"Initial observations as I've not had an opportunity to use it yet but will follow up more in depth... this brush was shedding the second I held it. Several hairs were sticking up above the knot loft and these were easily removed. Also several bits of hair came out of the knot. By bits I mean as if some of the hair ends had broken off.. real small bits. I think this may be due to washing several, if not hundreds, of knots together at the same time from the factory since the brush doesn't have the usual \\""dirty badger\\"" smell but smells as if it's been washed as the clean, soapy scent on the knot out of the box is overpowering. I can picture many knots in a soapy bath being agitated by an arm to get them all clean and all of that knocking about causing split and broken hair ends and those bits of hair getting into the knot. The hair is soft for the most parts but the ends feel bristly and pointy in this dry and unused condition. I'll see how it feels when full of lather... Would have been nice if it came with the usual plastic brush stand but one of those can be easily found elsewhere.",2
3,"I'm used to an outstanding performance from China Glaze, but this one was weird. The colour is a beautiful, silvery blue that matches the blue holiday decorations seen everywhere. The formula, however, dries so damn quickly that it's hard to get a smooth coat. It dries to almost a matte finish, which I'm not a fan of.<br /><br />For me, this polish was underwhelming and tricky to apply, so it gets three stars. It's ok.",2
3,"Shipment is on time just like how it is described.<br />Dryer is little heavy for use, I like compact once.",2
3,"We love this flavor, but want fluoride in our toothpaste. Tom's uses an environmentally friendly process-sourced fluoride, but we can't find it in cinnamint any more! The cinnamon-clove flavor is not our favorite.",2
3,Batteries drain super fast with this mirror. Especially if you turn it on all the time to do your makeup like my wife does. I plan to get some rechargeable batteries for her someday. Other than that the light for the mirror works great.,2
3,"I was so excited when a package came for me that day. I instantly rushed to open it, and grabbed the bottles from the box. Ran to the shower and pumped a handful of white goop onto my scalp and began massaging. I love the sweet almond mint and fell instantly in love with the product on my fine textured short platinum blonde 'do.I had purchased the set of three for fine-to medium textured hair. Until, i tried the cucumber aloe! if anyone hasnt done there homework on this product, the cucumber aloe is designed for non colored treated hair. It did NOT work wonders on my over-processed blonde. It ended up leaving me with breakage. :( So, on to the next, Lavender! i was excited about this one because i heard this one was the most \\""voluminous\\"" one to make the hair fuller. Tried, and my boyfriend told me my hair smelled like a FOrest!!!! Haha. Overall, on your scalp the products are so invigorating and the overwhelming smell is to much for me. Unless you want your hair to smell like a cedar tree?! I would recommend the sweet almond mint from the set of three and that one ONLY. it seems to be the most universal for every hair type to.",2
3,A lot thicker than it looks. Kind of bulky.,2
3,"I don't know if it's the scent of this shampoo, but I just don't feel that it leaves my hair all that clean. I used alot of it and then decided to shampoo with something else because my hair still smelled dirty. Maybe good for someone who shampoos daily. By the way it's smells sort of like pina colada.",2
3.0,Great price but doesn't remove glue from lashes,2
3.0,I don't know if it worked exactly like it says. My boyfriend still gives me the same amount of attention as he did before. But it does smell really good and I'd buy it just to use it as a perfume. It arrived very quickly. I feel like it did put my in a better mood and I kept smelling it on myself all day. So the scent lingers.,2
3,"The \\""red\\"" is more of a scarlet/orangish color instead of what I would see as a pure red. I did a swatch of the pink. Which I love against my skin. I will update once I actually wear the color for a long period of time.",2
3,"These brushes seem to be a beginner's set. When you first open the package, there is a strong &#34;plastic&#34; smell. The case is good enough, but I don't expect the case to last years and years.  The brushes are soft, but don't seem to hold the make-up as well as my natural hair brushes. I like this set, but don't love it.",2
3,I love how it mounts and it didn't fog until a month passed. it should only get two stars but i have yet to find a mirror that doesn't.,2
3,love the color but a few of them had the tops missing. not sure why but the black ones seem to be better quality,2
3,very good,2
3,"I ordered this originally on February 1st.  Within a week the tracking indicated it was shipped and I would receive by 2/18.  After that date came and went with no shipment I contacted seller.  I must say that they were prompt in their response.  However, I was told that when I placed the order initially it was on back order.  I don't recall seeing that message as I never order anything when it is on back order but I could have overlooked it.  I do find it curious though that tracking message reflected it was shipped.  Apparently the back order and weather resulted in the delay.  I was refunded my shipping costs and offered discount on my next purchase.  This was a nice gester.  I was told I would receive my package &#34;next week&#34;.  I finally arrived on March 1st.  It was shipped from Boca Raton to me in Delray which is 5 miles apart.  Makes me wonder about the &#34;weather issue&#34; but I did finally receive it.  I am giving this 3 stars due to the delay's.  Seller did try however to make amends when they could.  I wish however that they would have sent an update out regarding the delays and not wait on the purchaser to chase down the order.",2
3,"I am a novice, so I don't have much to compare against.  I wish there was a little more blade exposure, but for a beginner, this may be for the better.  For the price, I would recommend this to start with.  As I get more comfortable with straight razor shaving, I will upgrade, but I am satisfied with my purchase.",2
3,Not as I expected,2
3,"Bought this product six months ago after a good experience with an older Remington model. The trimmer works well, but it stopped holding a charge after two months. The brand new product was good for about 3-4 shaves, then it dropped to two. Now it will only hold enough for one shave, and when it dies, it dies lighting-quick: full speed to completely dead within 20 seconds. Now I have to charge before every use. Not ideal.",2
3,I like the perfume.. but does not last longer than few hours. I was expecting it to last for longer time.,2
3,"I have coarser, dryer, thicker hair. This brush is a tad rough on it. Probably works better on silkier hair",2

3,"I'm not really sure what the &#34;Burt's Bees Brightening Refining Tonic&#34; is supposed to do, but it seems to be a very mild astringent. It is refreshing to apply to the skin in the evening, and my wife indicates that it is effective at removing some remaining traces of makeup or other cosmetics after they are removed by washing or other methods. The tonic does not leave the skin feeling dried-out.",2
3,"This product is ok.  It's overly scented which gave me a headache the first week.  At most, it is a nice moisturizer which absorbs quickly.  I have seen no improvements in my skin after using it for a couple of months.",2
3,"I have recently started straightening my naturally wavy hair, and have a friend who swears by Moroccan oil for dry ends.  I found this one and it was a good price, so I ordered.  The first time, I used way too much (about 9-10 drops), and my hair was heavy and oily all day.  Next time, I scaled WAY back and only used a couple of drops, but then didn't feel like I saw much of a difference.  This is a pure oil, not a serum.  It may be better as a skin moisturizer, while for use on hair, it may be better to find a Moroccan oil that is specifically a hair product to be less heavy.",2
3,Smell bad.,2
3,"Another you get what you pay for scenario.<br />Basically, I do like this, but don't expect much out of it.<br />It misses a lot of hair, especially for me on the neck,<br />causes some minor irritation dry or wet.<br /><br />But if you just need something to clean you up before a razor shave, I'd recommend it.",2
3,"This definitely makes your skin feel good and cool as you wash it, and it feels refreshed after washing, but it did nothing for my acne. Eventually I found a good birth control that cleared it. I think this was worth the try and it might work for someone else though. Everyones bodies react differently to different things!",2
3,Barely bettter than the dull shaving head I replaced with this product.  Seems lower quality and definately not as close of a shave I would expect from a brand new shaving head.  Will not be purchasing this on Amazon again!,2
3,"Was nice looking and got when they said, but the sizing was off. I can't even wear it. Sellers should put sizing in inches and give leeway",2
3,"I have used the Honest Amish beard balm, slick beard wax, original beard wax and extra grit for about a half a year now. My beard is maybe about one inch to an inch and a half long and pretty curly. Honest Amish products are great, I don't really care about chemicals or anything like that, but the products do what they say. The scent on all but the extra grit are great, the extra grit doesn't smell bad, but like other reviews have said, licorice scent, which I'm not too much of a fan of, but all the other products have a great scent. They do a great job at keeping the fly aways down and the beard sculpted. I haven't had a problem with black flecks on my hands when I rub my beard with my hand, so I don't know what that other dude was doing. It also doesn't add much volume to my beard, but it's already pretty full so I don't need it. If you're looking for something to keep the beard sculpted and the fly aways down, I'd go with the slick beard wax or original beard wax, unless you like the smell of licorice or your significant other does, then get this one",2
3,"I'm sure the wipes work as advertised, but I was not prepared for the warnings posted on the packets. Why a disinfectant should require washing &#34;contaminated&#34; clothing and hand washing after use is beyond me. I will use these up, but I don't see my reordering them any time soon.",2
3.0,"An average dry shampoo ... I've purchased better and worse.  The smell is quite nice, though - almost reminds me of coconut.  It just doesn't absorb oil terribly well.  I probably won't order again, as there is another comprably priced brand that I prefer.",2

3,"At first I quite liked this product as it was recommended to me by a couple different friends, so I went out and purchased it. I didn't really feel the difference, but I only used it for a couple of weeks as it started to smell very medicinal (in a bad way) and I couldn't stand it.",2
3,"Bought this brand after seeing my previous one (Wind Salt) go up in price by over a dollar since I bought it a year ago.  This brand doesn't last for me for more than a few hours (and that's not even with significant sweating).  Wind Salt lasted me all day so I may go back.  I used to think all salts would work about the same, but I guess not.",2

3,"this mask is just ok. it is a little sticky, smells ok but doesn't give me that \\""stinging\\"" feeling to let me know it is really working. the mychelle pumpkin mask that i used in the past is better in my opinion - less sticky and stings a bit to let me know it is penetrating (and smells amazing!). i bought the apple mask to help lighten dark spots on my face, but i know that it can take months for a product to have any affect on that (esp. since i have had the spots for sometime now).",2
3,Fast delivery! Was disappointed that the lotion was expired! Maybe post that the tanning lotion is expired so buyers will be aware before purchasing! Still gonna try it out and pray it works! o,2
3,No difference after use,2
3,Nice looking bath item but I really don't think its worth the price. Oh well,2
3,I would discuss this with a friend or family.  It requires a charging stand that is included.  I wish the charger would just plug into the razor.  It doesn't shave as fast as my old 12 year old Norelco did.,2
3,I applied as directed. It adds length but not fullness. It did not come with an English pamphlet and tubes were not plastic sealed.,2
3.0,"Left a film on my hands so I gave to to my mother, she likes it...go figure",2

3.0,It's a soap nothing special about it or the smell won't bother purchasing on the internet.,2
3,hated it on my hair especially because my hair was layered and down to my waist. it was annoying and i ended up just using the lil ones for my daughter to give her curls. i put on her hair at night and since it's mostly foam she leaves it alone (she just turned 3) and even with her hair that never holds curls this thing actually gives her curls that lasts the whole day.,2
3.0,I last bought revale day cream in July for $71.21 for 1.7 ounces in July of this year. The product is now listed on your site at $104. Why the increase?,2

3,These are not bad but hard to use. I found it slipping out of my hair. Colors were good though,2
3,"I have normal Asian skin. I needed hand soap so I bought this. But it drys out my skin too much. Never had any hand soap drys me like this. And the Tea Tree smell is not pleasant to me.<br /><br />However, I do like how clean my dishes are. I'll just use it as a dish soap.",2
3,"The item description made such a big deal about how these were high quality bamboo sticks.  They look like regular wooden manicure sticks to me... and, quite honestly, so does the picture - I can see wood grain when I zoom in for a closer look!    All the manicure sticks were the same color - wood colored.  They were a little longer, but not thicker than the ones I normally get.  I think I prefer the oval end on a regular stick better, but this can be filed (or whittled) into that shape.    I don't know what is supposed to be so special about these.  I did like having them delivered to my door - thank you, Amazon!  :)",2
3,"After using the AHA cleanser for a month and LOVING the effects, I decided to try some of the other products in the line.  I was especially enticed by the moisturizer because it has a high level of SPF.      Unfortunately it leaves my skin as oily as a regular sunscreen does.  It does, however, have the same active ingredients and smell as Oil of Olay.  So if you like that, you may like this.  I do not.",2
3,"Okay- after having used this for a couple months now, I'm modifying my revue.   This was my first impression: &#34;What I hate is the intensely pungent and disgusting scent. Just got this and so I don't know how effective it is, but it REEKS! It is HIGHLY perfumed and the scent is very specific, unnatural and, well...just plain gross and tacky. Personally I prefer to chose my own perfume, I don't like having it imposed on me with a product that is supposed to do something specific not related to scenting me! Yuck. I don't know if I'll be able to bear it.&#34;  I still hate the smell and don't understand why any cosmetic companies destroy otherwise perfectly good formulas by overpowering them with (often toxic) perfumes. BUT, THE STUFF WORKS. I have had progressively thinning hair and I've tried rogaine, nioxin, etc... this product is the only one that has actually done anything. My fall out went from being very worrisome to essentially negligible. It takes a while for new hair to grow out, so I don't feel a real thickness to my hair yet, but I can see from my drain that my hair doesn't fall out anymore. Also, I can get away with not washing my previously extremely oily hair every day. Instead I was every other day, which I'm sure is good for my hair too.  To use, I just fill the dropper, touch it to the top of my scalp and just kind of run it through my hair, in horizontal rows, while squeezing/dispensing product gently and gradually. I work my way down in rows, all around until it's all dispensed. I do this one to two times per day.   I'll give it 5 starts when it smells better (or not at all!)",2
3,"The cream looks and feels great. Smell is amazing, not overpowering or anything.    However the packaging leaves a lot to be desired. There was no plastic seal, and the paper seal was already partially removed. A good chunk of the shaving cream is missing, not sure if this is how it's supposed to be. The chunk is about 1/4th of the shaving cream, and makes it look like a good piece of the pie is missing.    1/5 for packaging, 5/5 for the product    Upon closer inspection it seems a LOT more of the shaving cream is missing than I previously thought. Not sure if this is how it's supposed to be, but the cream might fill maybe less than half the bowl.",2
3,I bought this for a friend and she really liked it. I used it and it was a little to greasy for me. As long as she was happy that's all that mattered.,2
3,"It doesn't smell as good as the perfume, but it's still smells nice to me and i will use it",2
3,"I ordered this a few weeks ago but just tried it yesterday.  Generally, I like L'Oreal products but this nail polish color is just strange.  Why, I do not know.  I am fair skinned so thought a rose color would look good.  Nope.  Overall, the polish went on very well with no overwhelming smell.  Will keep using L'Oreal products; just not this one.",2
3,"The first two uses (7 days apart) left my skin feeling very soft and smooth, but no visible difference.<br />The third use (7 days later) tore up my skin and it took a week to recover.  It was very leathery while it healed, then flaked off (I had to use a lot of moisturizer and not let people get too near).  Granted when all was said and done it was about as smooth as the previous 2 applications.<br />I partly blame myself for being a little over-zealous in the scrub portion and taking too long on the activator.<br /><br />I still think it's a decent product- just don't get distracted and rub too hard/long or leave the activator on too long.",2
3,"Stinky, stinky stinky but I still mix it with my henna.  I use shikakai shampoo now so I've really laid off the oil except for henna mixes.  I love the results I'm getting...my hair is so much stronger and full.",2

3,Husband is a dermatologist and he recommends this to all his patients who do the Botox treatments. I just started using these creams myself.  <br /> <br />One of his patients is who first introduced this to him. She has been using Rejuvinol and Rejovox for over a year now and she praises them to no end. I was never the type of person to fight the signs of aging (probably because I never had to.....until now). I am now doing everything short of plastic surgery to not stop the signs of aging but to slow them down. My friends all spend tons of money on beauty products. These are the only creams I find worth spending on! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />,2
3,"Heads up : This product is identical to Trader Joe's Oil Free Moisturizer - packaging and ingredient list, even when tried side by side. Trader Joes was significantly less expensive. As far as how it works, it's not terrible, but I didn't like the feel of it, skin felt oily in about 20 minutes, and makeup didn't apply smoothly over it.",2
3,"I am a big fan of natural products and decided to give this a try. It is not easily absorbed as described. It nurtures skin, but it is not a miraculous formula. Bio Oil is a much better option to keep your skin hydrated.",2
3,Nice hair. Very thin though. It also says 16-18 inches. The package I received said very clearly16 inches. Why put 18 in the ad if there is no 18 or even a choice? Other than that it's nice quality but will require two to be really effective.,2
3,"I like that it's very thick but lightweight. I have dry, sensitive skin so finding the right moisturizer is always hard. The only product I have every used from Philosophy was the cleanser, Purity and it had a very light citrus smell and very gentle on my skin so I decided to try out the moisturizer. It's thick, but I still use it during the day because my skin can get very dry. It's very moisturizing and doesn't irritate your skin. Although, it smells pretty bad.. kind of like wet dog and plastic? I was hoping it would smell like the cleanser. I might change to a different moisturizer because the smell is too much for me.",2
3,"Easy to apply, looks nice, doesn't last longer than regular nail polishes",2
3,I love the suckers.  It is like a blast from the past.  I used to buy these when I was a kid.  I would rate them 5 stars but the packaging was terrible.  Many of the suckers were broken. I ordered another box with a sucker stand for a party and being shipped together that box had no breakage,2
3,smell nice not too strong just the way i like. Will recommend it to my friends.,2
3,"I've used numerous high priced lotions, and this just didn't do much for me. Smells great. Thats about it. I've used walmarts tanning lotion as my back up lotion for when my good ones ran out and that one is better. Honestly, I just think its the brand name. I've heard Luminary was nice, must try that next.  Happy Tanning :)",2
3,"I have had acne off and on for most of my life. My acne had been well managed for the past year and a half. I went in to have a microderm and glycolic peel at my favorite local salon. I've had this combined procedure many times without issues. This time I had one blemish on my forehead that was scraped during the microderm. A week later, that one blemish had turned into 5 and two to three weeks after that, had completely taken over my entire forehead with more pustules than I could count (thank goodness for bangs). At almost 40, I'd never had such a bad breakout in all my life. My doc gave me oral antibiotics which did nothing but give me a yeast infection. My doc then advised that I should take Accutane (for the 2nd time in my life). I declined. I read that many people had good results with this cleanser so I figured I'd give it a try.<br /><br />I find the cleanser to be effective, albeit it is no miracle worker. I do not find that it breaks me out, which is a plus. But I did not notice a drastic improvement in my acne after I added it to my skin care regime. I find that I have to add it with Philosophy's Purity in order to really get all my skin and eye makeup removed.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I will order this product again. It works well but is really nothing special in my book. But if you are looking for a gentle cleanser that does not break you out, this may be a good option for you.",2

3,"Ordered this for my daughter who has daily breakouts that stays for weeks at a time and leave red scars.  She tried this for 3 weeks doing it only once a week because she didn't want to over do it to begin with.  It did not stop the acne.  Her face was a mess.  She stopped using it and now we are trying something else. Maybe it would have worked if she did it more often or had a higher % acid, but she didn't want to keep making it worse.  She had as a teenager used the over-the-counter salicylic wash, but it never worked and the Proactive did not work either. I can tell everyone from my own experience with acne that the only products that work for me are the prescription ones with sulfur in them but you have to use it twice a day everyday. Everyone's face is different but this just did not work for her.",2
3.0,undecided. will update.,2
3,"Nearly 2 years of use have taught me that the No!No! does remove hair, but not as advertised.<br /><br />I am a brunette. As such I have dark hair in places that I would rather not, such as the shadow on my upper lip that started to become obvious around junior high school. Ugh!<br /><br />I had seen No!No! advertised again and again and finally I just could not help myself and I bought it.<br /><br />It took a couple of times to get the feel of it and to move it smoothly and slowly so the machine doesn't \\""skip\\"" but it isn't difficult to use.. but it is timely.<br /><br />======<br /><br />What did/does the No!No! do for me?<br /><br />It removes fine hair, both light and dark. By fine I mean baby hair like the hair on the upper lip and jawline that is like baby hair.<br /><br />It removes it very nicely leaving a nice smooth feeling. While it does seem to cut the hair rather than remove it, it doesn't leave a shadow or a stubble feeling like the handheld feminine facial trimmers do. If you, or someone you know, gets in close to your face after using this on fine hair the feeling is soft and smooth skin, nothing else. No one will know that the hair ever was there. Another plus is that makeup looks nicer as there isn't any fine hair for makeup to cling too.<br /><br />======<br /><br />What does No!No! not do for me?<br /><br />It does not remove any course hair or stubble. It doesn't work on an occasional tough facial hair and is spotty at best on legs and thighs. While it will cut/burn/trim any fine hair on the legs and thighs it leaves everything else behind.<br /><br />I was using No!No! on my legs for quite some time - over 6 months worth of time. I would spend quite a bit on my legs while watching a movie and follow it up with a shave. I felt less stubble doing it this way, but is is more because the hair that is removed with the No!No! wasn't stubble type hair and I was hoping that spending the time doing this every other day would result in cleaner legs and eventually shaving less.<br /><br />I never have seen less hair growth anywhere. I continue to use it on my face every other day. It takes just a couple of minutes and it leaves my face looking the way I want it too.<br /><br />Had this device been sold to trim peach fuzz or fine hair it would work perfectly as advertised, however the price point is probably more than a bit high to sell for that alone.<br /><br />======<br /><br />Why did I keep it?<br /><br />I kept the device because it was working on the fine hair on my face that bothered me so very much. I was hopeful that it would become permanent or at least less troublesome and that by working on my legs that even though the courser hair wasn't being removed that perhaps it was being affected and would become finer and... well I have a heck of an imagination.<br /><br />======<br /><br />In Conclusion:<br /><br />Since I did pay for the device and it does serve some purpose I will continue to use it. At this point I have no illusions that my fine hair will go away or that I will be able to repurpose my my pretty pink tweezers into a framed artwork piece on antique beauty supplies. No!No! is what it is.. a really close hair trimmer by electrical wire. It burns fine hair very close to and at the skin line. When used every other day it helps to create a fine pallet for makeup and smooth place for tender touches and kisses.<br /><br />======<br /><br />And Finally....<br /><br />I have not completely lost site of believing in permanent at home hair removal and may at some point try [[ASIN:B00B0S7KUY Tria Hair Removal Laser 4X - Blush]] but at this time I will continue to use the No!No! for its limited use along with my [[ASIN:B000EMUDUQ Tweezerman  Stainless Steel Slant Tweezer, Pink]] [[ASIN:B001GS6OB4 Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator]] and razors. With these combined tools along with an arsenal of facial and body cleansers, exfoliants, creams, lotions, oils and butters I am able to get asexy sleek appearance. :psexy sleek appearance. :p",2
3.0,Good and heavy,2
3,"I bought it to see if it worked better than double shaving with old fashioned Gillette (three blade) shave. Result, sort of. Be careful, follow the directions. I am not sure I will purchase again. Just shaving the old fashioned way easier.",2
3,"This works better than bobbie pins and clips; however, it creeps up the back of my head, along with the wig, so that I still have to adjust the back of the wig on a regular basis. Works well on front and sides -- feels very secure.",2
3,"It is ok as a foundation base but, for me, it did not deliver the stellar results it did for others.  There is nothing horribly &#34;wrong&#34; with the product, but the price is way too high if it does not result in any noticeable difference between using or not using it.  Before purchasing, I checked several review sites and found that it appears to be a hit-or-miss across the board.  I would highly recommend buying the smallest size possible (or trying to score a sample somewhere!) before investing in a full-size tube.",2
3.0,"This is the first split-cake I have ever purchased. I ordered this for a specific church event where I was volunteering to paint designs on the children. While the split-cake is quick to become creamy and goes on very easily, the colors are not as dark/bright as I thought they would be. The children loved their rainbows, but it looked like they would fade quick.",2
3,"This is a pretty good product.  I only use it at night because it is heavy when you put it on.  But if you have very chapped lips, it is a good product for getting your lips back in shape.",2
3,Hard to keep the lid on when towels are inside. Gets too hot! Cool looking though.,2
3,"This does what it claims, however it's a bit messy and I got the same results with Crest Professional Effects Whitestrips.",2
3,Doesn't smell as great as my other oils ( I normally purchase from Native American or YL) but I use this one in a diffuser instead of therapeutic use because of that.,2
3,"i got these for my gf, she said they werent the best. also said that they would be great for an art project but not really very good for your finger nail. so its up to you if your wanting to use your money on these.",2
3,The product is good but it would be much better if the mirror be large and magnified.  The LED lighting also needs to be improved with more powerfull lights.,2
3,Used this product once b4 blowing my hair and since the day was humid it did nothing for me will retry on a better day.,2
3,"My husband likes it.  He often complained about feeling &#34;greasy&#34; until he started using the Defense bar.  Glad we found it.  It arrived within a few days and although a little expensive, it is well worth it.",2
3,"Just started using it but excited to see how the growth works, I was doing fake lashes and extensions but hope this is a good alternTive",2
3,The bangs look exactly like the pictures and the layered cut in the back is so cute. Only thing is the front is a bit long for my taste so I trimmed it down. U also can't put heat to it it will burn and the sides start to tangle and mat up quickly. It also has no combs so i sewed some in. Overall a nice wig for a couple weeks.,2
3,"I bought the ES-LT41-K when an older Panasonic model finally began to wear out.  It does an okay job, but I can't say it shaves any better than the older, less expensive model I used for 5 years.<br />Pros:<br />I actually like the ultrasonic cleaning mode: it works quite well and was a feature my previous shaver didn't have.<br />It provides a decent shave (but not noticeably better than previous shaver)<br />Cons:<br />Large bulbous shaving head makes it somewhat difficult to get a close shave just under my nose.<br /><br />All in all it works fine.  Just not thrilled.",2
3,so - so results,2
3,"Been using it for about 3 days, will continue to use to see if I see any results, will rewrite review when done with the product.<br />Thanks",2
3,Smaller then I thought would be. Much too curved blades. Very hard to lock or unlock!! Price was within reason.,2
3,"I am sure this product would be just as great as other EA products, but for some reason my neck broke out. I have very fair skin and I must be allergic to this item. I always put cream on my neck. The neck lines really tell the age of one, so always take care of the neck area just like your face.",2
3,I prefer another brand who is about the same price.,2
3,I chose this rating for this fragance oil bc i perfer the smell of the actual cologne over this fragance oil. It's not bad but i perfer the original.,2
3,"Came with the pink gooey soft wax. HATE it..Had to purchase the hard wax and love that one. Do it right, no pain...the pink stuff sucks!",2
3,"I'm not terribly sure if this stuff is even working.  I think I've gotten better results from OTC products.  It seems to be drying my skin out, and considering that it contains hyaluronic acid, that's a little weird.  I've used other serums before - successfully - mainly Perricone's stuff.  I was looking for a lower cost alternative, but perhaps this just doesn't work well with my skin. ( I'm 50 and have very fair, sensitive, combination skin.)  It's kind of hard to judge skin care products because even though this hasn't been fabulous for me, it might be the very thing for someone else with a different skin type.",2
3,"I ordered this thinking it would be a peeling gel, Cure aqua gel or Skin79-style. It's not! It is just a cream cleanser. It has teensy tiny beads in a non-foaming cleanser base which I think is meant for very dry or mature skin. It's smells like berry yogurt, which is lovely, but I don't find myself reaching for it unless my skin is good (otherwise I use my Neutrogena with 2% salicylic acid)or not really in need of much cleansing. Basically I use it because I bought it and it smells nice. 80% chance I wouldn't buy it again.",2
3,"Not too happy with the way this sprays.  Great product & good color, but can't stand polka dots!",2
3,Paler than I thought<br />Recommended by a friend<br />Looks better in the bottle than on fingers<br />Will not buy again,2
3,"It's a good product but... I noticed that while I forgot this one at home, I had another bottle of a lotion I had purchased at the tanning salon and had to use it. It showed results right away while this one didnt. It may work different for some but for me it wasn't worth the high price that I paid.",2
3,"I feel like it should have come with an extra razor at least, and the bottles of product are very small. However my boyfriend said it is a great shave.",2
3,The lipstick itself is a nice quality but I ordered it color wise from a tube I already had. This tube looks just like the color pictured. What I received looks like a mauve color even though the number and color match.,2
3,"I like that this is natural, but it's a little too powdery to be that noticeable. Also, the colors are all very similar. I would suggest buying individual pots.",2
3,"While the color stain compliments my skin tones, it does not go on very smoothly an does not last very long.",2
3,I love the yes to products as a brand and I especially love the yes to carrots brand specifically.  So I picked this up at the drugstore because I liked that it was a product that leaned more on the natural side with no parabens and no testing on animals.  The Yes to Carrots brand is specifically made for normal to dry skin while I personally have oily skin; maybe that's why I felt like this was more of a moisturizer as opposed to a cleanser. The product is very gentle though and I would recommend it for someone with dry skin but not for oily skin.  Because of its moisturizing properties I use this after my cleanser and after I exfoliate to add a refreshing effect right before I put on my actual moisturizer.,2
3,"This bottle is surprisingly small, but if you use it as directed with the micro-spatula that's included, it should last quite a while. Both my wife and I tried the product and it appeared that our eye lids were getting smoother, but the results seem temporary -- when we stopped, our eyelids went back to their previous state.",2
3,Definitely was not shave ready.  Have yet to get an edge on it that I am satisfied with.,2
3,"This applicator is way too big, it smudges everywhere.  If I want to use this eyeshadow I take a q-tip (wet it down a bit) and apply it that way.  For the cost of this item I expected the applicator to be great not bad.",2
3,Relatively expensive and from limited sources. You don't have much choice if this is the product the lady wants and likes.,2
3,wasn't overly impressed with the way my hair felt after using and my scalp couldn't seem to adjust...but it has a lovely smell. I passed it on to a friend so it wouldn't go to waste and she loves it.  Her scalp isn't as sensitive as mine and her hair looks great.,2
3,I was thinking that this ink would be a good all purpose ink because it says lining Tribal Shading ink its not a dark black but a very good shading ink and WorldWide Tattoo got it to me fast. If you are looking for a shding ink this is the one to buy.,2
3,"Bristles fell out of the larger brush after first use. My daughter has long, fine hair, that's not particularly tangled after a shower so I'm not sure what the problem is. The smaller brush seems to be a bit more sturdy (but too small for her head of hair). I'd rather have one \\""better\\"" brush than two crappy brushes. I'll shop around more next time. The shipping was lightning fast, though.",2
3,Didn't see any difference after using and would not purchase again.  Actually very disappointed. The write-up looked too good to be true and it was.,2
3,"I thought I was getting 1 each of the items shown, I could of bought the same size for a cheaper price; I do love this lotion, it was confusing with the 1 ea,",2
3,"I found this paper easy to work with, and the tattoos last a really long time. But they aren't very realistic. They are very shiny. In places that don't have ink, you see the glossy plastic coating. Also, they wrinkle like your skin wrinkles, but the gloss finish accentuates the wrinkles, which I found unattractive.",2
3,"Yes, mostly the barrette portion of the clips provide the most color. There is few color down the fiber optic &#34;hair&#34;. Purchased for my 7 year old's halloween costume this year and she loves them, so her opinion is all that matters. It gives off a lot of light though and that was the whole purpose. For the one day that I need them, it's perfect after that, I don't care how long they last!",2
3.0,"It's an oil, so I guess it is exactly what you think you are getting! Did nothing for my stretch marks, Palmers Tummy butter and firming lotion worked like a snap! Both are here on amazon too",2
3,"Smell doesn't last too long or isn't really there at all, kind of disappointed especially for the price I bought it at.",2
3,"I didn't particularly like all of the odors but that's personal opinion, and some of the sticks did have a burn smell strong enough to cover the dipped scents. The price is okay for the ratio of good to bad sticks, thick and thin. Not as good as homemade incense but decent as a backup after you've already purchased them.",2
3,"Make sure you understand that this is not an electric shaver but an electric razor. Having said that, it does the job well. Is probably a little less irritating on the skin than the usual razor. So if you are looking for something for sensitive skin, a wet/dry electric shaver would be your best bet. I prefer Panasonic over Phillips but you have to try what works best for you.",2
3,"This is more of a glycolic serum. It is not bad and I have tried it at night after using Beauticontrol glycolic<br />pads then this before going to bad. Just an okay product, wouldn't buy it again!",2
3,"It leaves my hair coated with product and feels a bit stiff. I still use it sometimes in hopes that at least my hair is being protected by the heat from my flat iron, but I don't like the feel of my hair after it's use.",2
3,"These scissors are pretty good, but the blades are larger than I expected, more like toenail scissors.  They are too clumsy for cuticle trimming, I would prefer a smaller/finer blade.  Quality of product is very nice though, definitely better than a cheap drugstore scissor, but I don't know if they're really worth the high price.",2
3,"Petal Pink is a bright pastel pink with strong purple undertones.  It reminds me of the Rose shade from the limited-edition Nyx Macaron Lippies.  Those looking for a bright pastel pink without the purple undertones might try Butter London Lippy in Alcopop.<br /><br />This is not a very wearable color, especially if you have pale skin.  It could, however, be used in a very specific look.  I recommend it for people with cool-toned skin.  I do like doing strange makeup looks so it will get some rotation, but it is definitely not an everyday color.  I will have to be careful not to go full Barbie with it.<br /><br />The formula is not fabulous.  It lasts four hours (with fading), but will not last a meal.  It's also somewhat patchy and will settle into the lines of your lips; I recommend using either primer or liner first with this shade.  It also requires at least two coats to really show off the color and not make your lips look lightly frosted.  The formula is hydrating, which is a bonus.<br /><br />The case is cute.  I like that Maybelline went for something kicky instead of imitating prestige cosmetics.",2
3.0,"I'm honestly very ambivalent about this product. When initially applied, it hid a multitude of sins - wrinkles, large pores, and left a very silky, matte finish. However, once I started applying mineral makeup with a brush everything began rolling off. I had pills all over myself: in my hair, on my clothes... it took forever to roll it off my face, clean myself up, and start over. Not good when you're running late for work in the morning! I continue to use the product on days when I don't wear makeup, but will not make the mistake again of using it UNDER makeup, at least not my makeup. I can't speak to liquid foundation, so YMMV.",2
3,"I must admit that I read the reviews before I purchased this scent, the scent is very light and smells like flowers. The scent did last for a few hours but you have to spray alot.When the bottle runs out I will not replace it. I guess because its a summer edition its suppose to be light.",2
3,I thought the product would be more comparbale for a woman of color. The color was not what I expected,2
3,You have to hold it at just the right distance to get the focus right.,2
3,These are ok. i dont feel they glide as well as other schick ones. but they do work and the price is good,2
3,The product is fine for curling your hair. It gets really hot to the touch and burns your fingers a little. Also not too great for longer hair. I needed  larger rollers and more of them. But it is small and easy to travel with.,2
3,This mirrors are large and clear.  The compact itself is a little cheap looking and mine was missing crystals.  Seller replaced without a problem.,2
3,"This is a very good quality bar of soap.  That said, I didn't care for the Linden fragrance and wouldn't order it again.  Unfortunately it will take me awhile to use up the 3 bars I ordered, because of the size and quality.",2
3,"I have used the Dove kind for a while, which smells worse, but seems to work a lot better?<br />this one definitely sprays white onto the hair",2
3,bueno,2
3,Didn't do anything for the dark circles.  Don't waste your money.,2
3,"This is a middle-of-the-road styling product, which isn't surprising considering the price and the fact that's it's Axe. It was decent on my short hair, but when my wife tried it on her longer hair, it was very stiff and flaky. I've found it can be hard to get a good balance between \\""holds hair\\"" and \\""not stiff\\"" (i.e. if you use too much of it, your hair won't move at all, but use too little and the product doesn't work).",2
3,"everything is good except the size of the item, its small<br />and very slow shipping",2
3,"Excellent color, but polish has separated.",2
3,The bristles are bit soft and do not do too great of a job with my makeup to do full coverage. I'll stick to the Bare Minerals kabuki in the future.,2
3,I tried this for the first time today but I didn't feel any warming sensation. Maybe I didn't put enough on. I guess I will keep trying and see if it gets better.,2
3,"Not a bad product.  I used \\""smooth away\\"" on my face before applying the cream.  It does burn a little, but I have extremely sensitive skin.  It didn't break me out, and it didn't dry out my skin.  It has a very mild smell that is not offensive, and it made my skin feel very smooth.  We'll see how it works out after the next few applications.  It DOES say on the bottle that it will take 4-6 hair removal and application cycles before you will see results.",2
3,"The picture in this ad clearly shows a purple or blue bottom.  But what I received had a brown bottom.  Had I known it would be brown I would have never ordered it.  Too much trouble to send back, and besides, the brush does work.  I just wish sellers would show the actual item they are selling.",2
3,This product is OK.  When I purchased these I was looking for Xzen 1200 GOLD which works a lot better.,2
3,"It didn't do for me what others seemed to rave about. But, I guess everything is subjective.",2
3.0,"It's a very good clipper, but I didn't find it as revolutionary as the other reviews I read.",2
3,"smell is very delicate, unlike the boy axe gel.",2
3,Easy to replace the old foil and blade set with the new one. Works okay on short hair but takes a few more passes on longer leg and underarm hair. Not as comfortable as a disposable razor but there are no painful nicks. Price is high as the replacement costs almost as much as buying a replacement razor.,2
3,Bought for daughter as a gift. She had a hard time using in her hair even after watching multiple videos. At least I have some new pastels to draw with,2
3,The trimmer is easy to clean and trims but it has difficulty trimming close in the nose and this leaves me with some nose hairs a bit too long.<br /><br />Construction is very solid.,2
3,"It is OK, results are not that much quick and it caused allergy on my eye lid the first week I used.",2
3,I wrote a review before but I decided to change it because i was going based off my first impression. I've used the purple one a couple of times and I have to say that with a couple more dollars you could definitely get a better one. It's not terrible but it's not the best. For example it doesn't soak up water well and when it does the blender itself doesn't feel any different from when I first took it out of the package. It's very dense rather than soft and squishy.,2
3,okay okay,2
3,Just didnt work for me really...<br />Iv been off of any conventional shampoos for about 6 months then i switched to this one... It left my scalp dry but the hair near it was very waxy and felt greasy.. I know my hair was clean but it felt like the residue did not wash out and was from the soap... Maybe because of our hard water,2
3,"I purchased this pencil based on the many good reviews, but I find it to be of middling quality.  It goes on smoothly, but I find that the color is really noticeable in my brown brows and it's very obvious that I'm wearing an eyebrow pencil, which is not the look I want.  I really prefer my brows to look naturally full, smooth, and arched than to look like I've applied a brow pencil.  The color is  more of a medium golden/chocolate brown than a dark brown.  I also do not like the small brush on the end.  It really does not do the trick in smoothing my brows.  A spoolie works much better.  A much better product is the IT cosmetics brow pencil or the Benefit cosmetic brow pencil.  Both are quality pencils that blend in well with my brow color and both have spoolies on one end.",2
3,"Have not used this product as directed,  so I can not honestly say how it works.  May write a review later",2
3,The mist doesn't rly spread that much. If it had range like ac care essence I woulda given it a 5. Other than that it's pretty convenient to have if u like this line,2
3,I guess it was ok! I liked all of the make up. If your only looking for a case with a little make-up and lots of storage get this. There is a ton of storage for make-up you already have and in my opinion it is overpriced. But my overall review of the product is 3stars,2
3.0,Was cheaper at Walmart<br />Like product,2
3,"I tried to use this on my eye lashes.<br />Long story short, I looked like I cried for days after 5 minutes of use.<br />But I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning so used it on my eye brows instead.<br />They worked great on my eye brows. they are definitly longer thicker and healthier looking.<br />I used to have to HAVE some kind of 'eyebrow darkening' make up. Now I really don't need to. I'm that satisfied.<br />It's just that.. if you have moderately sensitive eyes, you can't use them on eye lashes.",2
3,"I was looking for a good indoor tanning lotion to use in my tanning bed. This lotion had great reviews which is why I decided to give it a try. Not that great. It smells good. I noticed some darkening after the first use. You have to be extremely careful because it will streak and leave dark spots around elbows, ankles, etc. It reminds me more of a sunless tanner you buy at walmart. Don't recommend.",2
3,All of the brush is really soft but there is one broken one but I glue it back together. There are a lot of brush that got repeated.i was looking for a blending brush but it disappointed me a little. The brush were a little shorter then I thought.,2
3.0,This mascara does not really make your eyelashes longer. It's very thick and hard to use but the side that has one written on it works good alone.,2
3,they are good,2
3,"Nicely made, like the stand, but reflects no better than the $3 one I got at a discount store....doesn't seem to enlarge at 15x.  My 'cheap' 10X works better.",2
3,"I have allergic contact dermatitis, so I have to wear gloves all the time. The fingers on these were too long, so I can't do much while I'm wearing them. The glove fits my hands and wrists well, so I just wear them to bed with ointment.",2
3,"The Philips Norelco YS524/41 Click & Style Shave Toolkit is a decent electric razor and groomer. It comes with three separate attachments, an electric face razor, a beard trimmer, and a body shaver. All three attach easily by snapping on and can similar detach easily by pulling off. All pieces are easy to clean: just run under hot water and use the provided brush as necessary to get all the excess hair out. The base handle piece is a bit big and bulky but is comfortable to hold. While the battery life is quoted as 40 minutes, I actually found it to be probably about twice that, and it seemed to die without warning. My impressions of the three attachments are as follows:<br /><br />The razor is a typical &#34;safe&#34; razor style in which you should theoretically not be able to cut yourself by shaving (however, I actually drew blood yesterday while using it). It contours to your face as you move it around your cheek and jawline. While it generally works well, it has some drawbacks. I have found that I can never get a full clean shave with it and still have to keep my traditional hand razor to clean up remaining hairs that it misses or to hit my sideburns or the sides of my goatee. Since the razor is circular it has a difficult time hitting edges like that. Also, it is incredibly slow to use. I can shave much, much faster with a regular hand razor.<br /><br />The beard trimmer has an adjustable piece that attaches to the trimming unit so that you can adjust the closeness of the blades to your face. I've found it to be a bit frustrating to get it just right, as when I hold the razor upright (that is, with the handle pointing down) I can't seem to get much progress in trimming my facial hair; contrarily, I can hold it the other way with the handle pointing up and it will overtrim.<br /><br />The body shaver is frustrating, to say the least. It consists of a regular metal shaver/blades like the other two pieces, and also has a plastic attachment that serves as a &#34;comb&#34; while shaving. I have found the comb to be not much use, as not much comes off while using it, and unfortunately without it the blades pull a bit painfully. I find this attachment to be the least useful.<br /><br />All in all I would say that this grooming toolkit is decent, but would recommend something else if you can find one that is better reviewed.",2
3,"I am bleaching my hair and it feels like it is about to disintergrate it is getting so crispy when dry and stretchy when wet! And all I ever wanted was lucious blond hair, what nature should have given me... It worked to get my hair moisted again for combing/styling but it then evaporates leaving my hair back in its brittle dry state. I've had to get leave-in conditioners to keep it \\""glued\\"" together for the daily haul.",2
3,"The Bunion Aid helps take pressure off my extra-long 2nd and 3rd toes, which were sore from being pushed toward the outside of my foot, and were rubbing against the inside of my shoes. I've worn the Bunion Aid for several hours a day, and so am not sure the device is actually correcting the bunion.    The flexible hinged construction works well (in theory), but when the hinge flexes, the entire splint (including the strap) tends to rotate toward the top of my foot, releasing the tension on the big toe. This happens regardless of how tight the strap is fastened around my instep. It rather defeats the original purpose of the splint, in my opinion. I wish there were a way to hold the hinged joint in place over the bunion.    Also, I found the felt pad around the big toe wasn't soft enough, so I improvised a silicone gel toe spacer pad inside the toe strap, to give extra cushioning. I found that after wearing the device in my tennis shoes for several hours, the bunion becomes red and tender from friction against the felt pad, so must limit the amount of time the unit is worn, especially with shoes.    Overall, the Bunion Aid helps relieve some pressure, but the price is a bit salty considering the final effectiveness of the product.",2
3,"I use it for a shoulder/chest/back scrub-wash. I don't really use it on my face, and there's not very much in it, so I'm not sure if I will purchase again. I do LOVE the smell though...haha.",2
3,"I love mineral make up. It is wonderful because it looks great and does not feel like you're wearing make up. This is my second bare minerals starter kit. I bought the second starter kit because I really like the bare minerals brushes and it is cheaper to buy the kit than the brushes individually. Bare minerals has changed what you receive in the start kit since I first purchased it. I think the old one was better.    The first starter kit I purchased had:  - Two shades of bareMinerals SPF 15 Foundation (.06 oz/2g) in Light and fairly light  - bareMinerals Mineral Veil(.06 oz/2g)  - bareMinerals Warmth All-Over Face Color (.02 oz/.57g)  - bareMinerals Glee All-Over Face Color (.02 oz/.57g)  - Handi Buki Brush  - Maximum Coverage Concealer Brush  - Flawless Application Face Brush  - How-to DVD.    The new kit has:  - TWO shades of bareMinerals SPF 15 Foundation: Light & Golden Medium (Size: Medium)  - Mineral Veil (Size: Medium)  - Warmth All-Over Face Color (Size: Medium)  - Full Flawless Face Brush  - Flawless Application Face Brush  - Maximum Coverage Concealer Brush  - Prime Time  - How-to DVD.    The really differences between the two products: the old kit had a Handi Buki Brush when the new kit has Full Flawless Face Brush. I think the Handi buki brush is the better of the two brushes but both do a good job of applying the make up. The second major differences the old kit had small Warmth All-Over Face Color and Glee All-Over Face Color the new kit has a Medium Warmth All-Over Face Color. Again I think the older kit was better. Warmth is a bronzer that gives your skin a natural sun kissed glow. Glee is also a great product, it is a plum shade blush. It gives your skin a touch of natural color as if you have been exercising. Both of these products are great but you need to be careful not to use too much.    Personally without Glee my face ends up looking pale, my face really needs a little bit of color beyond the foundation, warmth and mineral veil. Glee is my absolute favorite bare minerals product. Mineral veil is a great product that is a great finishing product. It gives your face an airbrushed look.    What I do not like about bare minerals is how it sits on top of your pores and makes them look bigger. Unlike the commercials claim you do not look like you are not wearing make up in fact your look like you are wearing tons. It is a natural look but still a make up look.    Frankly, there are better mineral foundations than bare minerals my favorite is E.L.F. (eyes lips & face). It has a great mineral foundation which is better than the bare minerals foundations and a fraction of the price. I like it better because it does not make your pores look bigger. E.L.F. also makes a product called mineral booster which is like mineral veil.    My overall opinion is to buy the starter kit once to get the brushes because mineral make up needs special brushes. Use what come with it and switch to a different foundation and continue using Glee and Warmth.    Mineral make up last longer if you apply a moisturizing before the make up. One trick I have learn to minimizing the appearance of pores under mineral make up is to use a acne moisturizing and let it dry before applying the make up.",2
3,"I liked the smell of this in the store and was very excited to go from BoraBora to a new scent. Well...I can put this on when I start my make-up and by the time I'm done (20 min. max) I need to do it again. The smell is warm and sweet but who will know it unless they stand next to me while I'm spraying it? <br />I consider this fragrance a waste of money...very expensive for a few moments of joy. I've used up almost the whole bottle and will never buy this one again. It could be that it just does not work with my chemistry, but here's a note to rethink your choice.",2
3,"I love these but am so disappointed that most of Kiehls special oils, which lasted forever, were inexpensive, and got more compliments from strangers than any fancy perfumes, are now all gone since L'Oreal bough out Kiehls. They need to bring them back. Musk remains and is a good standby, though Skin perfume (an inexpensive Bonnie Bell product) - which I've used for 40 years - still gets compliments from everyone.",2
3.0,Doesn't really smell like the actual perfume. So it's more like a manufacture issue.  I feel like it wasn't worth the price.  it's exactly as shown in the picture...it's a ring.  it's like a balm.,2
3,"Pigmentation is really good. However, it was extremely drying on my lips. Within hours of application, my lips would start cracking. I wont be repurchasing.",2
3,"I used all 10 of these and played around with my technique.  With some work I can get a good shave with them, but after only 3 shaves they were significantly duller than other cheaper blades such as the LORD Platinum.  And if you can get 5 or more shaves from a FEATHER then that too is a better deal than these blades.  They are worth experimenting with, but not the best blade out there.",2
3,"No noticable results after 2 bottles, not going to get it again. Nerium is much better.",2
3,"I have been a loyal Benefit blush user for years (benetint, several of the box o' powders, posietint...) so when this came out I couldn't help but buy one. It's awful as a lip tint; it immediately dried my lips and had a very chalky feel. As a cheek tint it's ok. The highlight becomes all but non-existent after you've blended and it did wear off after 4-5 hours. I did find that I only needed to do one swipe to have the color show, although I have very pale skin (usually the lightest foundation color).<br /><br />Save your money, this product doesn't work as a two in one and it's not better than any of Benefits other blush products. I did recently discover BECCA's beach tint product which does work great as a 2-in-1 for cheeks/lips. So if you're after a 2-in-1, try them.",2
3,"Came another one, but its ok. All redken products are good, so no problem. But it was not the one that i choose.",2
3,It definitely made a difference in the texture of my hair.  Great product; unlike any other conditioner.,2
3,Some of the bottom ones dry out fast.,2
3,Not as good as the other pan stick,2
3,"The mirror performs just as described, BUT the swivel mechanism failed after about 2 months of use. My wife is shorter than I am and she uses it to see her face while showering. After many times of her pulling the mirror downward so she can view her face, it no longer stays up with water in the reservoir. Therefore it is useless for me to shave with unless I hold it with one hand and shave with the other, which is what I currently do.<br /><br />OK mirror, just does not hold up.",2
3,Pretty good until I lost it. Very small - think I used it a month.,2
3,This item is a travel size and was $8.00. It works great but clumps up at the end of the brush so you have maneuver the brush to take the excess mascara off prior to putting it on.,2
3,"I love the smell, but it is not very moisturizing for my naturally curly hair.",2
3,this polish is ok. the color is like a deep blood red which i really wanted but when you use 2 coats it gets really dark almost like black. its hard to tell its blood red unless you are looking up close,2
3,Not the same recipe as the original Udderly Smooth that I bought years ago.  But it is good hand cream,2
3,"I like White Diamonds from the old scents, I decided to try this and my friend thought I was granny buying this thing....LOL I've used it till it's finished, twas my everyday wear....it was ok not overly powerful. Nice perfume for a young lady.",2
3,"I just started using this a couplf of weeks ago. Its hurts, but I know its for my own good. Looking to get rid of makrs on my legs and chest area.",2
3,Its ok doesnt work as well as I would hope but its decent. Small for 11 dollars!! I would maybe recommend it,2
3,periorub is meant for healing the space between your gums (healthier gums) basically.  It works great as toothpaste,2
3,smaller than i thought. they were less than an inch.,2
3,I loved it when I first started using it but for some reason the scent started to change on me,2
3,"I have been using this at least once a day and sometimes twice for a little over a month.  It has no sunscreen, so I don't use it if I'm going to be outside during the day.  I haven't noticed any lightening of a freckle-colored age spot on my face, but the cream is very nice.  It goes on more like a serum--not greasy at all and absorbs almost instantly.  It has no odor that I can notice.  The color is somewhat weird--kind of a light tan, but it doesn't put any color on your skin.  I will continue to use this until I run out, even if it doesn't lighten my age spot, because it has retinol, which is what I look for in a night cream, and I like the serum-like way it goes on.  It would be nice if they put some sunscreen in it.",2
3.0,"Haven't worn it for more than a few... but it is nice and surprisingly lightweight for a reverse dangle.<br /><br />It is pretty. However, it does look a bit inexpensive up close. From far away much better. The rhinestones do shimmer.",2
3,A little too sheer.,2
3.0,Didn't really do much for me. Applicator was good but sometimes you didnt feel nothing like you wondered if you really put anything on.,2
3,I bought this product as I was seeing a bit of thinning on my scalp. I bought a three month supply of this product and did not see any results so I stopped using it. I will say that the foam application is easy to apply and leaves little mess. It didn't work for me though..,2
3.0,Nice Shea butter but has specks of dirt or something in it. Was not prepared to have to strain product.,2
3,"It was ok, but nothing special for the price.",2
3,smells good,2
3,Travel size should be the first statement in this add/description. There is not any context based on the container that is pictured.,2
3,"It is ok for casual use because the water tank is too small. For daily use, the water capacity is too small",2
3,There is a special about this product. It is just a long makeup Q-tip that's all. It's just ok nothing special,2
3,Not too good,2
3.0,These are huge! If you have small to average nail beds and/or do not have long nails don't purchase this item.  They'll take up your whole nail. They are cute though!,2
3,"Were smaller than expected, and they have this weird balloon smell to them. It gets the job done though",2
3.0,I like the product but the shipping cost more than the bottle,2
3,"Everything worked as Smooth Viking described it would.  The only thing I would change is the smell.  I use a leave in conditioner that smells awesome.  Since this is a beard product you can smell it all of the time and therefore due to the smell, I personally wouldn’t use it again.<br /><br />*Received a complimentary sample for our honest opinion.  All opinions are our own&#34;",2
3,"Kinda hard, bends back to straight and won't stay in eyes you need strong glue",2
3,"I really liked how the Tanwise Dark Bronzing Sunless tanner went on because you could see where you were putting it. Did not do well around feet and I used leftover on mitt to do them. And on me, it didn't last very long unless you did it everyday. Overall, I liked it though!",2
3.0,This product was listed at a really good price so I purchased it. It shipped promptly. It was as described. The complaint that I have is that it does not have a normal scent like other perfumes it is very vague,2
3,Smelled beautiful but just too small for the price,2
3,Not as good a product as it was a year or so ago when I bought the last jar.  Seems to have less lanolin and more water.  Still a good product but disappointed that it is not as good as it could be.,2
3,"I learned later that these bottles are a common type used by people that package their own product. It makes me less comfortable, not knowing exactly what is in it, that it's what it says it is, etc.<br />The single use label on the dermal roller also makes me uncomfortable.",2
3,no improvement that I can see,2
3,I was not  impressed so I do not have a lot to say about this product. No more to say,2
3,"I bought this product because an easy to use, nice smelling leave-in conditioner. This product fulfills my needs, except I have one concern: usually products that have a strong (yet pleasant!) scent are drying. Therefore, use sparingly just before blow drying, and don't expect your dead ends to heal from use of this product. You'll have a nice smelling head though! FYI, product scent does not stink up the room, as far as I can tell. Scent will stay close to your head.",2
3,"This hairspray is okay; it works if you put a lot on your hair, but it is really &#34;wet&#34; and causes my hair (fine/normal and wavy/curly) to droop. It is nice that you can brush through your hair and re-style, but I find that I have to use another hairspray to make sure it holds. Did not work for my hair type, or my preference of a hairspray that is quick-drying and perhaps more of a mist.<br /><br />Also, makes my floors very sticky!",2
3,"I admired the smell out of the bottle when we first got this. I assumed that it would smell that way in your hair, too. So after about two weeks of use we've noticed that the dandruff problem has improved dramatically (much like if we had used a conventional dandruff shampoo). I'm happy with that, even elated. The smell in your hair is pretty bad. It's very sulfur-y (an active ingredient). I joke with DH that we paid to get a water treatment system to take out the sulfur and missed the smell so we had to get this shampoo. We will keep getting it, though. The benefits (little or no dandruff) outweigh the problems with using a product laden with very toxic ingredients.",2
3,I purchaced this item some time ago and it appears to work better than a regular toothbrush. Need to replace toothbrush head frequently. Good brand and available in many stores.,2
3.0,"Though this is a beautiful head piece, it is very heavy and my daughter could not keep it on.",2
3,doesn't smell the same,2
3,"Cleans really well and leas my hair feeling super soft. If you are like me and have curly hair and tend to leave the conditioner in when getting out the shower, do not do this with this. I forgot to wash it out one time due to habit and my hair felt so dry throughout the day like straw. Great for cleansing but not a regular conditioner lol",2
3,"I really like this color, but the application is a bit tricky. This formula (and other darker gelish colors) seems a bit thick. It's really hard to apply several thin coats rather than one or two thick and globby coats. This lends this particular color to lifting. It's alright. I can usually only get about 5 day's worth of wear from this.",2
3,The rose scent is a little overwhelming for me but it does a good job moisturizing.  I'd probably try another Badger product but I won't order this one again because the scent is way too strong.,2
3,"Skin is not silky and smooth. A huge amount of hair grows into skin,and then it is so itchy. It removes hair really for some 2 weeks but skin is not smooth.",2
3,I bought this to store a variety of items in my ever-growing cosmetics collection and thought I had found a good deal.  The case did not have dimensions listed and was disappointingly small when it arrived- only about 8 inches wide and maybe 6 inches tall and deep.  This case also has the unfortunate habit of tipping over when it is fully open- not a beneficial feature when dealing with the fragile and expensive items it is supposed to house.  For now I keep a mug with my brushes in the front hatch when I use it on the counter but I plan to replace it asap and maybe use it for travel only.,2
3,"I can't use hyaluronic acid for some reason, no matter the brand. So, I let my mom use this, she loves the way it absorbs, and leaves her skin feeling soft and refreshed. The color of her skin has improved as well. Sample received for review,",2
3,"I was just starting on my nail art and though this brush set would do, but I can't get it to do what I want it to do and they are more like mini brushes. So disappointed.",2
3,This thing barely helped I mostly had to remove my piercing with my fingers,2
3,Was not the right curve but I have found another use for product.  Didn't show proper curve style in add.,2
3,"It was great for a quick cosplay, but this made me realize I should pinch the wallet a bit more because this wig falls apart very easily.",2
3,"I was expecting a tad more power, but for the price I'm still happy.",2
3.0,"I needed this for business travel because it was so compact. I use the full-sized version Jerdon mirror at home and I love it (the one with all the bells and whistles)! The travel version is better than nothing, however, the lights are so bright, you can't really see what you're doing because you're blinded. I'm not in love with this one, but I'll keep it for the convenience of not having to pack the full sized version, and for not having to stand in a hotel bathroom mirror, trying to put on make-up and dry my hair.",2
3,This is my second bottle and I haven't noticed a change at all in my hair or nails.  The product seems very expensive to keep trying.,2
3,"These were sturdy enough yet I believe the cost was far greater than the actual production cost. The clippers were sufficient, nothing more, nothing less.",2
3.0,"i bought this after seeing this on a korean makeup show-- supposedly it has good coverage and works for oil control<br />it doesnt really have that good of coverage but it does work for oil control, as my skin tends to get oily especially when its hot, also when put on skin it makes your skin feel really soft",2
3,Im not very happy with this product. The reviews on it were so great I had to get it however now that I have it the product does not work on my skin.,2
3,"for the money, it is a good deal when you compare this to other solid colognes on the market. I bought this scent after the bay rum scent. the smell is okay. however does not have the mild and sweet sandalwood smell i was expecting. austrailian sandalwood may smell different than other kinds.",2
3,Used this for keeping up short hair into a pony tail for jazz dance recitals for my granddaughter.  Works okay but not really any better than a regular max hold brand.,2
3,Nice enough but no wonderful fragrances like the descriptions evoked. There are natural products with good scents but this set is rather m'eh.<br />*if I think of it I might post some of those alts.,2
3,I really like this fragrance. But the longevity is very poor. The drydown is better than the top notes. Recommended for daytime.,2
3,"The first shipment is sort (3) brushes, I sent an email to request. Few days later, I received the short. I was not confident about this company.",2
3.0,it's ok but will never shave like a blade,2
3,Value for a decent price.,2
3,"I purchased this product due to the continuously blooming area of south Florida that I live. The medication itself works well, but the bottle's design is such that if you tip the bottle to the side, the medication freely flows without squeezing the bottle.<br /><br />Great medication, poor bottle design. For the amount that is wasted each time I use this product, I'm guessing that I could have bought the brand name product.",2
3,"Product seems to work well. It has sparkles in it though, I was expecting more of a matte white base. If you are putting a glimmer eye shadow over it though, it is very pretty.",2
3,The only problem i had with it is the gun itself didnt come chrome like the picture shows it came red and the grip is purple and i was really counting on the chrome one but over all its a pretty cool kit aside frome it being in different none matching colors !!! Everything works great !!!,2
3,I like this product however and unfortunately I didn't use it right the way and didn't inspect properly when received.<br />Used once and already noticed the cord/wire in the back is broken/exposed. It won't last long before it breaks for good.<br />Not happy about it; Regret buying at Amazon because it is too hard to access customer service and even consider a replacement.,2
3,Smells really good. Works decent. But a little but too oily. Doesn't really do a lot for my lips. Wouldn't buy again at that price,2
3,"I gave this product 3 stars because they work, however, they don't stay on that good.  After using the lamp for a week, they get lose and move around and then fall off.  Plus they wouldn't work on two of my lamps.  So I only ended up utilizing 2 of the 4 in the package.",2
3,El pegamento estaba seco,2
3,"I liked the head band the only disadvantages were it did not come in black and the elastic was not tight enough for me. I purchased the midnight brown but with my hair being off black a black one would have been a better match. I'm not sure if I just got one that had been stretched out a little to much before I received it or maybe I have a small head LOL.  However, the head band is very cute I just really wished it were a little smaller/better elastic to keep the head band more secure on my head while wearing.",2
3,"I got this in the mail and it was not what I was expecting at all! The picture I had when I chose to purchase this product was totally different. It is an ok case and it works great for traveling, but the stylus pen it mentioned in the  description was nowhere to be found. I'm still deciding if I like the fit of it or not.",2
3,"Okay, but found other combs better.",2
3,Its alright. When I received the package i was pissed off because the product went everywhere!! The lip glosses are not the best quality I could've got the same type for 2 dollars each-nothing special. The eyeshadow are nice though and pigmented enough so I guess it made up for the crappy broken blush.,2
3.0,"Love it! Taylor of Old Bond Street has, in my opinion... the best Sandalwood scent! Reminds me of the Ol time barbershop smell. I still love this stuff but the last one I received had scuffs all on the jar... I sent it back and Amazon refunded my money. I reordered and the one I just received 6/11 15 appears used. I'm not saying it is, but it looks nasty. that's why I'm changing to 3 stars from 5.",2
3,"I puchased this product to treat the milia around my eyes. I've used it several times and haven't noticed a difference. That said, I do like how smooth it makes the area around my eye. It's mild and hasn't bothered this sensative area.",2
3,worked fine,2
3,Read that tea tree oil could get rid of jock itch and other yeast infections and am still waiting....,2
3,LOVE THE PRODUCT AND THE GOOD SERVICE.,2
3,"Trimmers cut well, but the blade broke on the first fall to the floor. I now have to buy new blades.",2
3,"Bought this for my mom, she likes the perfume, but the packaging was horrendous. although the shipper tried to preserve it in bubble wrap, instead they ended up smashing the box all to heck. didnt damage the perfume so all is well, just hard to wrap a smashed box.",2
3,"It's not as good as the original,which was discontinued several years ago. The current product has sunscreen in it. Like many customers who LOVED the original, we don't want sun protection. We just want the mega tanning lotion or gel. This current product works, but customer needs many more applications to get the same effect. Will someone PLEASE tell me why such a successful, popular, profit-making product was d/c???",2
3.0,runs small,2
3,the consistency of the produce is running.  It was not running before.,2
3,"It's a better product for fine hair than I've used, but still not what I'm looking for...if that even exists.",2
3,I didn't order the correct mask but this is a good quality mask,2
3,It does the job but be aware that this product is really thick and can get cakey if you are not careful. If you are going to use this concealer to cover some of your face imperfections I would recommend moisturizing your face first.<br /><br />I give this concealer a 3 because it has a poor selection of colors and because it creases under my eyes.,2
3,color was off,2
3,"It's ok, cuts finer hairs though",2
3,"Breaks easily, but it is reliable",2
3,Good toner.,2
3,"Amazon's price was comparable to local salons. It arrived quickly and packaged well. I have only been using the product several weeks ,so really don't see much difference in my hair. It takes several months to make a valued statement about it's action. I hope for new growth and healthier hair. My hair came back very thin in patches after chemotherapy almost 2 yrs ago.",2
3,"I wanted to love this product... The packaging is so very cute, but the scent is just okay. I expected a floral, but this scent is SO overpoweringly flowery! Kinda fake smelling. I still use it since I probably have a more sensitive nose than others, and others will like it more than me.<br />It's about the height of a lipstick tube, and a little wider. Like a glue stick.<br />The perfume applies okay, but wears off after a while.<br />Still, very cute to keep around. :) Except the purple one looks sorta angry...",2
3,"These worked just ok. There was a slight difference, but not too noticeable. Unlike others, I didn't experience sensitivity and they were easy to use. I think in the future it'll probably worth the time and money to invest in whitening trays instead of buying more strips.",2
3,It would be a great product... if it all worked all of the time. Note: you get what you pay for. If you mess with it a bit you can get most of it to work. Not the quality I was expecting.,2
3,Not really a fan of this yacht man red because it smells way too sweet but yacht man blue smells great and is a must buy for how cheap it is.,2
3,I bought this because I thought it didn't contain parabens and fragrance. The description made it seem like it was all natural based on the selective ingredients the lister put in the description area. I was very excited to get the product but now im disappointed. It does smell nice and the bottle with the little metal grape detail attached to it looks very nice and decorative but Im a person who is not into fragrance (unless its natural) and preservatives and found the description to be misleading. I wont return it because it does look nice and it does leave my skin smooth so maybe I will use it once in a while and have my house guests use it as well.,2
3,"I have tried several of Watts products, and I will say that I do think there is genuine Hyaluronic acid in them, as they are moisturizing.  I am not so sure of the other listed ingredients... I have used for about a month, but in reality, that is not long enough to visually assess change on texture, etc. of skin, I don't think.  But, I fear that whatever ingredients that Watts does try to incorporate into their serum, they do not fully succeed in getting the fluid homogenous.<br /><br />The nozzle gets clogged sometimes, so I bang the bottle on the surface for a while, to help unclog--- sometimes that helps.  The bottle is sealed, so I am unable to open it to get at remaining contents. Sometimes the fluid is clear, sometimes cloudy, sometimes even more cloudy.<br /><br />I do believe that the ingredients listed as being in the solution are truly there, but they are not fully incorporated into the serum to create a homogenous consistency.<br /><br />Perhaps, Watts simply needs to increase the size of the exit path from the bottle and nozzle to overcome this trouble with getting the bottled contents out.",2
3,"These are KNOCKOFF perfumes. I think it's pretty obvious from the price and title, just making sure you know what you're buying. I have worn a lot of these Jordache knockoff perfumes and smelled most of the others. The dollar store at the mall where I used to live had tons of them. I liked them a lot as a broke teenager. Though at one point I liked one of them so much as to ask for the real version for Xmas, and the real version smelled ENTIRELY different and SO much better. But almost all of these do smell nice. I would recommend them if you want to wear perfume and can't afford a low-end brand-name perfume like Bath & Body Works or something. Just don't pay more then a couple dollars for it.",2
3,"Not a fan of the barrel.  It is too bulky.  Also, wish that the wand was longer.  But once you get passed the ackward phase of trying to handle it and apply it to your eyelashes.  It doesn't look so bad.",2
3,Silky and does not tangle easily but it seems they are not strong holding/long lasting (I use to do sew in extensions).,2
3,"IT does a great job on shorter hairs, but not so good with slightly longer ones, you'll still need to manually hit some areas.",2
3,Made in China and quality is not good enough,2
3,"I love the smell of this.  It's chai, clove, cinnamon yumminess.  I have no idea if it works better than other products; it is probably as good as anything you buy in a drug store.  It can leave brown stains on things, but they wash out.  I get it for the smell.  Sometimes I even put it on as I leave the house, instead of perfume.  It's expensive, so if you are just looking for something that makes your feet softer, get a pair of cotton socks and Lubriderm.",2
3,"I've never saw blue camomile before, then I found out that is the process they use is solvent rather than distilled, maybe tiny tiny traces of the solvent in it, I've only used it twice in my ultrasonic diffuserso I don't know quite how well I'm going to like itI will probably try the distilled type again and compareit is not bad though",2
3,"I purchased this hair mask after reading about it in a magazine and after reading some reviews about it.  I am a little disappointed.  I didn't really notice that much difference in my hair, even after leaving the product in for about an hour.  I don't think it is worth the price at all.",2
3,"The Remington FR730 is constructed with two \\""flexing foils\\"" (I would call them straight shaving heads) and something called an \\""intercept trimmer\\"" which is designed to shave long hairs. This all sounds great, but the features I like best about this shaver are the good battery power, the pop-up trimmer (which provides a nice crisp edge), and the wash ability of the shaver (just pop the head off and rinse).<br /><br />What I am not crazy about is the basic design of straight shaving heads, especially in comparison to my old Norelco shaver, which has three rotary shaving heads. The advantage of the old Norelco is that the shaving head flexes in just about any direction and follows the contour of your face much more easily. While the Remington 730 has \\""full-flex\\"" technology, in reality it flexes back and forth (minimally) and side-to-side (very minimally).  To some extent, it's like rolling a two-inch length of wooden dowel across your face. It's not completely uncomfortable, but it's certainly noticeable. In any event, I'm definitely partial to the Norelco style with the three rotary shaving heads (by the way, today's equivalent model would be the Norelco PT730 at just over half the price of the Remington FR730 - and, no, I have no idea why both models end with \\""730\\""!).<br /><br />So, I'll give it three stars since it does shave fairly close and shavers are such a matter of personal preference, but I think I'll stick with my old razor.",2
3,I did count how many peices there were and there was slightly less then half of the 244 peices it says that you receive! You get about 8 to 12 peices of each design which is not even ten to do a whole hand if you like. But they are great quality and beautiful.,2
3,"I really enjoyed this...while it lasted. It takes a really long while to get here (compared to US shipped items) but when I got it I wore it with everything. The cork flower piece falls off so I had to superglue it and the cork in place,  but ultimately one of my daughters broke the bottle off of the necklace so I threw it away. I only paid a dollar for it whereas at a place like Claires or Icing the same quality necklace would be around $12. I want to buy again but I cant find it from the same seller for the same price. 3 stars due to cheap quality",2
3,"The brushes themselves are soft and pretty, but they do not work very well. They do not pick up product very well, which makes it hard to apply my makeup. For the price it is a nice set, with tons of different types and shapes of brushes, but I don't hardly use any of them. I would say I might use maybe 5 out of the 22 brushes. Would not re-purchase. Would be a good set for a beginner, or a teen looking to just have a first set of brushes, but a medium level to professional level makeup artist would not like them.",2
3,"THE HAIR SPRAY IS OK, IT COVERS THE GRAY ROOTS,COLOR COMES OFF ON YOUR PILLOW. I COVER MY HAIR AT NIGHT THAT SEEMS TO WORK.",2
3,"The product in itself feels nice on your hair but it doesn't have enough conditioning for my hair.  The product I received was also in a pump bottle, which is nice in theory, but when I received it some of the product had leaked out and the pump has been broken since.",2
3,The white one's brush heads is not same as picture,2

3,"This tweezer set is a great price, and it seemed to have a lot of good reviews (from people who got them free or at a steep discount--I did not.), so I got them.  I've used them a few times and my thoughts sum up to: they are okay. They seem well made and like they'll last.  The tweezer tips seem precisely machined and strong, but for more delicate jobs (pulling out a fine splinter for example) even the most thinly pointed tweezer was too blunted. I imagine they should be fine for most other uses though (pulling out stray hairs, or whatever else).  I kind of wish I'd gotten something else, simple because my only use for tweezers tends to be for very delicate tasks.",2
3,"Its ok, but it wouldn't be a mainstay for me.",2
3,"I was very pleased that the iron was sent sooner than expected. It appeared to be packed well. I was not entirely happy with this iron. My daughter has an identical one and I love hers, thats why I ordered one for myself. This iron does not heat up and get as hot as it should therefore it does not work as well as I expected from the CHI name.",2
3,"I was looking for a lip balm that was more natural and hopefully contained honey.  Honey is supposed to be good for skin and most everything else.  I was looking at Burt's Bee's balm, but it seemed pricey and I saw a review by someone recommending this instead.  It's ok.  I like the large size of the tubes and the price is good, but it really doesn't do a whole lot as far as protection goes.  That might just be me, perhaps it works better on others.  Another thing is to get the benefits of honey you have to have raw honey and this isn't, so I really don't think the honey does anything more than perhaps provide scent or flavor.",2
3,"It works great in all the sense that it leaves your hair soft and tangle-free but it is not LITE. It weighed down my hair, even more so than the original Its A 10 Miracle Leave In. Overall, it's a decent product, just use a VERY tiny amount. I suggest spraying it onto your hands and rubbing it into your hair better than just simply spraying it.",2
3,"While this is very pretty, and it keeps my ears warm, I won't order any more because the stiching looks like it was hastily done.  I just hope it lasts.",2
3,"Not amazing, not horrible.  Greasy feeling, very little flavor, scent or pigmentation.  Would not repurchase.  Prefer BBW or Body Shop or even Victorias Secret lip glosses and they don't cost that much more.",2
3,I didn't like the fragrance.,2
3.0,"Been using this product for about 6-8 months now and it definitely does not do as advertised...all my undershirts are getting stained in the underarms.  I think it's taking longer to stain than with other deodorants, but it's still happening.",2
3,Looks like the picture.,2
3,"Not comfortable, but I think I can trim it to fit my teeth. I don't really use it. My last one fell out of my mouth during the night (it was a big waste of $27! That was the sale price.) it was uncomfortable also. Anyway, then the dog chewed it up. At least this one was cheaper, and I may need it sometime, I have a tooth implant and am supposed to use one to prevent grinding.",2
3,I liked it okay but the color is way too dark for my skin color. A common problem for me.,2
3,"I wanted some colorful mascara, but the green was too green for me. It reminded me too much of my mom in the late 80's.",2
3,smell doesnt last long.. almost like an imitation of the queen of hearts not sure what the mi edp stands for.,2
3,Its really huge and it's smelly.,2
3.0,Its ok,2
3,"I gave this product a rating of only 3 stars as a result of the soap is really strong and drying to the skin on my face, so I'm not sure if it really works or not. However, on the body even though it is still drying it's not as bad. Also, I&#34;m not sure if I would purchase again.  I stop using the soap after 7 days because it was just too drying and cause my skin to itch a lot and actually broke my skin out.  All the same, based on the reviews if your skin can take it you may want to give it a try unfortunately, it just didn't work for me.",2
3,"I have an acne problem and have used Erythromycin for way too long. It has damaged my skin. It's very unbalanced. I switch between skin cleansers to keep it under control. This microdermabrasion does help smooth out the blackheads, but it irritates my skin a bit. It's an ok product. I'll prbably try something different next time though.",2
3.0,One side is good and soft for the face and the other is not that scrubby like I wanted.  But it's O.K.  Just not great on the side for scrubbing.,2
3.0,"I have VERY sensitive and dry skin, so I use many of the DMS/DML products.  This cream is fine, but for the price, really no better than most hypoallergenic creams on the market.",2
3,This works well it takes the time promoted on the product but it is worth it. It will let scars seem less visible.,2
3,"This is a nice color for most times of year. It is a tiny bit hard to work with to get smooth as some of these metallic polishes can be. I've noticed that with other china glaze metallic. It is a nice teal color but also looks mostly gold depending on the light. It really looks like the photo depending on how the light hits it, but not a blend, either teal OR gold.  Not really my favorite. It is ok for most settings and not too flashy in a casual office setting",2
3,"I've had this for a few months now. After 2 months the prongs to the adapter started to break off. Now too many have broken off and it is no longer useable. It's too bad really because the Devafuser is great! It keeps my hair from frizzing, however for the price I expect it to be of better quality. I decided today, before I throw it out, to give gorilla glue a try,,, lets see if I can get this adapter to remain on my hair dryer forever!",2
3,I like it...I'm on a hair journey trying out new products. This was my first time moisturizering with a butter and I learned a little goes a long way. I didn't seal as much when I used this product and I think my hair felt more moisturized longer with this butter than the other moisturizers I've used. I can see myself purchasing again....FYI: I have relaxed 4C hair.,2
3,Works as expected,2
3,"Love the colors, but they do not last long. I recommend using a primer prior to putting on.",2
3,As described and speedy shipping but it didn't do anything for my skin.,2
3.0,Can't really beat it for the price. It'll do the job in an emergency but at the expense of cutting you like mad and giving you scratches that'll stay for a day or two. I'd recommend getting a nicer version instead.,2
3,"First off, I do have slightly oily skin, so people with normal or dry skin would probably have a better time with this product.<br /><br />I got this pretty cheap, so for the price I can't complain much. I wanted to try it and now I have, and for me at least, it was just 'okay'.<br />I found the cream a little too thick, and it felt a little greasy after use. It was okay for using at night, but I want a cream I can use before I put my makeup on too.<br /><br />However, I will say that it is indeed good for sensitive skin. I never experienced any redness or itchiness like with some products.",2
3,"This does work, however, it hardly ever stays on after a few hours and never if it gets warm inside or out.",2
3.0,I do like it however the crayon part is so thin and broke off pretty quick for me :(,2
3,do the job but slide off,2
3,I got these before by the same company in brown and the brown ones were better quality.  I like them I just am not in love like I was with the brown ones.,2
3.0,"Seems ok.  Be aware that different cpap models have different hose fittings.  Best bet is to stick to the brand of tubing and mask that you have, to ensure a correct fit.  Also be aware that &#34;cheap&#34; cpap supplies are starting to hit the market.",2
3,"This is a popular fragrance, but I personally rate as \\""mediocre.\\""  It reminds me of Juicy Couture, but less expensive and less overwhelming.  Has a 'flowery' type scent- of which I prefer the \\""dry down\\"" notes better.",2
3,The color is much darker than shown but it matched my roots. I didn't notice any highlights not special shimmer. The color is sticking and hasn't washed out nor lightened after several weeks. I will try again with a lighter tone. The amount is generous for hair that is shoulder length with spare.,2
3,Only three stars because it is too long for my foot. To be fair I have very narrow feet and a size 6. To be universal it would be better to have it stretch more (then their could be breakage issues though). It is very lovely and I do like it. Well constructed as well. It just doesn't fit well on me. I think it would fit well on a larger foot (perhaps a size 9).,2
3.0,"Inadvertently filed down not just my nail, but also several fingers using these.  Still, I'm overall pleased with these.",2
3,Great way to try the different formulas- I love the hot pink best. I have combo skin and it seems to work pretty good with it.,2
3,"I think I only pay $8-11 for this product (not including shipping) so I don't know why it says $18 now.<br /><br />Actual product works great nice and creamy, great coverage.<br /><br />HOWEVER it's very small the diameter is about and inch and a quarter. I thought it would be bigger.  I wouldn't pay $18 for how big it is",2
3,I only bought it because it was discontinued for it's name and I think the name is great.,2
3,These nails crack easily when you are filing them down. They fit will and are ok for the price though.,2
3,"This is my third electric razor and it is the worst of the bunch. I like the ability to use it in the shower, but it just does not shave as closely as my other electric razors. I've used it for over a month and while it is good for keeping the scruff factor down, I still have to use a straight razor to clean up after the electric razor. I've tried using it in and out of the shower with the same results - it just doesn't cut that closely.",2
3,"it smells weird but you get used to it really quick. It definitely clams down your skin. It helps with the redness but not significantly. I used it for 3 weeks and I saw just a little improvement. I used it morning and night. It is thick and kind of greasy so you cannot put it on if you go outside. Also, you cannot sleep with it or your pillow will be orange in the morning. It is worth a try because it definitely helps to sooth your skin. Not sure about the redness tho.",2
3,"I thought this would go on like a deep, dark cherry...but there is too much pink in it.  I wear a darker shade of lip gloss over it to make it work, but when it starts to wear off, the lighter shade shines through.  I have this problem with a lot of shades.",2
3,Nice but of low quality very thin they were less the $20.00 so remember you get what you pay for..,2
3,Difficult to put on evenly,2
3,"This is a review for all the women out there that buy a lipgloss hoping that the colour will be exactly how it looks in the picture, then you recieve your parcel, only to find that it looks nothing like it! Well it's the same story here too! Fruit Smoothie is probably a good name for what the colour really is,  but please don't buy this if you're only going by the way it looks in the picture, cause you will be very disappointed. As for the true colour of this lip gloss? It is a soft translucent mauve pink! If you are familiar with the Bare Minerals Lip Gloss Colour '7Layer Cake' ......well its about 1 shade darker then that, and it does lean more towards a mauve pink, but still very much translucent in colour. So if that sounds more like a colour you'd like, rather then how it looks in the actual picture, then buy it......because you won't be disappointed!",2
3.0,I don't see a difference it just leaves my hair a bit oily.,2
3,"I like this scent.  It definitely seems more feminine than most other patchoulis and is nice to layer with other 'too sweet' smelling fragrances.  Although this fragrance has a sweet and a little unpleasant powdery beginning almost like a floral baby powder that seems to weave together with the subtle scent of patchouli that slowly becomes more prominent, but always remains joined to that powdery floral scent so  it never seems to be 'patchouli'.<br />I would probably not buy this again as it does nothing to really stand out for me and unfortunately does not last long.  I would have to guess that it lasts < 3 hours after application whereas other Kuumba Made oils have lasted well into the next day for me.",2
3,"Love the towel but the Large was smaller than wanted (similar to hand towel size), exchanged for an XL (similar to bath towel size).",2
3,"One of the brushes came broken, but nothing a little super glue won't fix. Other than that they're pretty good brushes.",2
3,"Wanted a less drying after shave than the alcohol based I was using.  This feels much better, but doesn't have much of a fragrance.",2
3,"Nothing really special about this color, very neutral & simple. The quality of the nail polish is very good, but this isn't something I would wear all the time. Neutral colors aren't MY thing, so I gave mine away. But if neutral colors are your thing then this is something you would love.",2
3,Works well; Trimmer heads not terribly short.,2
3,"Can't say I'd buy this again.  However the product performed as promised - I just felt \\""silly\\"" using it and was fearful it would be detected by others.  I think I'm gonna just stay with Botox!",2
3,"I bought this yesterday and used it and I wasn't very impressed. I was expecting super soft and shiny and I felt like it looked the same, but only a little better. Maybe it's too soon to tell, I will see how it works next week.",2
3,it does peel very fast.,2
3.0,They work great if you want to leave them around your neck. Not easy to pack up. They could provide a special case.,2
3,"This mask is, without question, the most exquisite and intricate mask I have seen and it would have definitely been a knockout at the New Years party we attended if not for one very important issue.<br /><br />The nose bridge on the mask is way too wide for anyone to wear.  My wife was very dissapointed.  No matter who puts it on, even an adult male, the pupils of your eyes will appear at the edge of the inner corners, so you will essentially spend the entire night appearing cross-eyed to everyone and every photo.<br /><br />The price is too high for this type of defect.  I kept the mask because I bought it during the holidays for a party and had no time to return it,  I ended up buying a few others at way lower prices.  The others were equally beautiful, but this was honestly the best.<br /><br />For those who think \\""well you can you just bend it\\"", think again.  Every slight bend felt one step closer to snapping the entire thing in half.  Running it under hot water to make the metal more pliable put it at risk of rinsing away and possibly losing the glued on red and glittery elements.  Now that I am stuck with it, I am going to give it a shot and see if I can bend the nose out and bend back the eyes accordingly.  I don't have any high expectations because one wrong move and game over, but i am armed with my soldering gun so look out.  Just a shame I have to modify it myself.  I don't see how this can fit anyone's face the way it was designed.  Maybe my wife can wear it next year.",2
3,It is very pretty however I think it is priced a little high.  It is heavier than other hair dryers that I have used.  A good point is that it is quieter.  I have not noticed any reduction in the time in which my hair dries.  Average product for me.  I was impressed with the looks but disappointed in function.,2
3.0,"So I received these today. They are not for people with a foot size bigger than 8 1/2... They also have a really strong smell. Like a chemical smell. So if your nose is sensitive. Dont buy. Also, maybe its just me, but when I put them on, I get like a tingling sensation on my feet & a bit of a sting feel on the tip of my toes. The only reason I give 3 starts is because after 20 minutes my feet do feel softer.",2
3,"I like this when I first put it on, but it does not really last all day.  Actually I am lucky if it makes it until noon and it is drying.  I do like layering this as a base and then using a red lipstick on top for real staying power and not so dry.",2
3,Color selection is nice but quality is poor,2
3.0,"I decided to try these sponges because of the money saving value pack, but I ended up being disappointed. I have tried other konjac sponges before and these were much rougher on my skin and it seemed that no matter how many times I rinsed it, the soap never rinsed out fully. I also saw little to no improvement in my acne. Although they are a great alternative because they are environmentally friendly, I would suggest spending the extra money and getting a different konjac sponge.",2
3.0,Would prefer a more auburn color with a mix /highlights for an easier blend,2
3,great product simple . we have no complain from this one. It does what it is suppose to do nicely.,2
3,"Effectiveness? Subjective, hard to tell. All natural products are all the rage and homeopathic doses of this can be bought too for to take by mouth. This is probably not advisable according to other sources.",2
3,Wasn't that gorgeous. Tangles hair a lot and hard to use.,2
3,the creams are way too small . the biggest thing is their backage 😖but the quality of the cream is cool,2
3,"rarely am I disappointed, but this time I was.  These seem to be really cheap,  price was, but they are too thin to fit any candle holder and I have several..  guess sometimes a deal isn't.  put them away to use in case of a power outage.  sorry.",2
3,"This is the third Sonicare toothbrush I have purchased either for myself or other family members. The first was purchased a bit more than two years ago and is still going strong-after being used at least twice each day. Another lasted a little over a year for my wife before it started having problems charging and turning off- had to knock off two stars for that. To be fair, her toothbrush developed a slight tear in the brush stub seal, so that may have allowed moisture to enter the handle body. Still, the seal failure should not have occurred from daily use. I am careful to keep the handle clean and dry, so perhaps that helps even if the sealing is imperfect. I also let the battery run down until the brush ceases operating- then I fully recharge it (takes about a full day) before putting away the charger.  I easily get two weeks of daily use (minimum twice a day, three on weekends) before it requires another recharge, and that is with using it in the full clean mode. By the way, I found a place on E bay where you can get a replacement battery if/when you need one. Just perform a search for \\""Sonicare FlexCare\\"" and you should be able to find it.<br /><br />Why did I state that 'the results are worth it'? I had changed dental insurance companies and therefore dentists. Because of that, professional teeth cleaning was put off for a year and a half. My new dentist remarked how clean my teeth were (this was after using the Sonicare toothbrush for that entire time period) and noted how improved my scores were over the previous cleaning record (I do keep track). My previous dentist always wanted to perform cleaning three times a year due to plaque buildup. Could simply be due to the differences in the professional staffing, but I tend to doubt it.",2
3.0,They're hard to keep on your nails even with nail glue. I love them in theory they're just hard to use.,2
3,Grains won't rinse off very easily. Scent doesn't seem to last. It's nice as a gift but purely an &#34;extra&#34;.,2
3,"I've been a blackhead sufferer since high school (I'm in my early 20s now) and I've used scrubs, pore strips etc. and Biore pore strips tend to do a great job with unclogging my pores of blackheads.<br /><br />This pack does a good job, but often times, the sticky strip would rip as I gently remove the plastic and doesn't dry as well as I would like.<br />It also doesn't pick up as much as I would like the strips to too.<br /><br /> I've tried the green and pink Biore strip packaging (the Ultra deep cleansing strips I believe they're called )before, and I must say, I prefer those over these.<br />It's still better than nothing, but I like feeling cleaner in one go, rather than using two strips to feel ultimately clean.<br /><br />The service and packaging was decent though for standard shipping :)",2
3,Product arrived on time.  Great product but packaging was poor and the jar arrived with a crack in it so that it had leaked out all over the box.  Disappointing to receive a package like this.,2
3.0,This is ridiculously expensive and really does not work well at all.  Save your money.,2
3,"The mirror works perfectly. However, most of the silicone adhesive that came with it had already congealed in the tube when it arrived. The small amount that I could squeeze out (using a pair of pliers!) wasn't enough to do the job. After a few weeks, the mirror came crashing down in the shower. Fortunately, it didn't break. I bought a tube of real silicone adhesive at a hardware store and remounted the mirror. So 5 stars for the design of the mirror and one star for quality control to ship it with a tube of silicone that had gone bad.",2
3,Awesome array and variations of the colors. I suggest using a primer and base to get the color that you see.,2
3,I thought this was like the kind in salons so I bought it and the dryer for my wife. It isn't the same.,2
3,Don't like as well as the regular Hempz.  Doesn't moisturize as well.  The fragrance is nothing to write home about.,2
3,There weren't any directions or quidelines on how to apply the concealer.  Lookedd easy on TV but not in real life.,2
3,did not keep tarter build up. I think there are just to many chemicals in our food to use these.,2
3,"I've used the product as directed. This would probably be very good for my hair needs, were it not for the Iron ingredient. I have a reaction to Iron which has caused acne breakouts on my face. This is a big draw-back in my continued use of this product.",2
3,Product is great. I bought the item because it has a pump. It makes it easier to use for my kids. I just wish the price wasn't that high. Costco has it only for $10. I say 5 star for the product and 1 star for the price.,2
3,Good for the price.  I like the colors but seem a little flimsy.,2
3,Good,2
3,"I returned one of these mirrors because it arrived with ugly looking chips out of the &#34;chrome&#34;.  It's actually just plastic with some sort of silver painted finish.  The mirror is a good mirror, the led lights are bright, and the suction cups work great if you attach them to glass.  The second mirror I received has some scratches in the silver finish that aren't too ugly, so I'm keeping this one.  But it's a shame that an otherwise nice item is ruined by a cheap finish.",2
3,Product was not the quality I was expecting. Main compartment smaller than originally appeared.,2
3,"Good brushes, but they're expensive.  You could buy a bit better brushes at sephora (their brand), but buying them individually might cost a bit more.  Brand name brushes like Laura Mercier will be better but a lot more expensive.",2
3,"The frame irritated my skin and I don't use them, but otherwise they are o.k.",2
3,"I have used Kanon by Scannon for 20 years...until the last few years, the imported aftershave was available on the web and at discount cosmetic stores.  Now, the only product available is a knock-off imported from Masson of Canada that does NOT incorporate Patchuli in its ingredients list...it does have the cod liver oil and its vitamins, but not that exquisite fragrance that lent Kanon such a spicy, luxiurious scent.  I miss the real Kanon imported from Scandinavia.  This is not Kanon by Scannon, it's Kanon by Masson of Canada under license from Scannon, and it is not the real thing.  If anyone knows how to find the Scandinavian version in the US, please lt me know!  I guess at $20 it's an ok value, but not like the original.",2
3,I'm a guy and I don't know why it feels that way while i'm shampooing. IT also doesn't seem to thicken my hair at all either.,2
3,"I go this for my kids to reapply at camp.  They are yound (only 5 and 7), so ease of use was important.  They did will with applying the sunscreen using this roll on type and for that I am glad.  But the size is really small... The whole stick was gone in less than one week for one - the other one lasted the whole week.  So the quality of the product is good, the roll on works well, but the portion size doesn't match the price.  You will notice as soon as you open.  It isn't even half the size of your standard deodorant.  So figure that into the cost and how much you'll need.",2
3,"It smells nice, but the price could be cheaper.  Still a great product though.",2
3,"I needed something along the lines of a Wonder Woman headband and it works! I dont' see myself really using it much, it fits well and....it works!",2
3,"Not sure if I should be hung-up on the fact that this product is presented (read:pictured and described as) having a silver-based antimicrobial coating (&#34;Agion&#34;) and then being delivered a different product (sans silver antimicrobial coating) but it does cut my hair. Not sure why Amazon allows this deception to persist but with a name like Cavetus Emtore you would think I would know better, oh well.",2
3,"I've almost finished a whole bottle.  Although I haven't seen any less wrinkles, my skin does seem less dry.  I haven't done anything else, so it must be the supplement.",2
3,Ok,2
3,This product works well. I have noticed a different in my new blemishes it hasn't faded old marks.  Wish you got more for your money. The smell is pleasant and it's not too oily,2
3,"Not a good sign when the cap breaks on first use and the jagged edge cuts your finger. Like many spray lotions, this can has a twist locking cap to keep it from spraying accidentally. When we turned to use it for the first time, the cap cracked, jabbed me in the thumb and wouldn't work after that. I ended up removing the cap and the broken half and got it to work again. After all that, it's really no more than lotion in a spray can just like with suntan lotions. Packaging aside, the lotion does a reasonably good job easing an itch but would be just as good in a squeeze bottle.",2
3,"I have a lot of long fine hair... not thin, just fine. This treatment works fine, but I would not say that it is extraordinary.  It does not seem to weigh down my hair, but I only use it every other week.  So nothing particularly wrong with it, but I probably won't order again.",2
3,"This goes on very thick and I got a few breakouts from it, i switched to neutrogena clear face and I get no breakouts, it's not greasy and it absorbs well.",2
3,"I didn't love this product as much as everyone else did.  The bottle is very hard, making it difficult to get the product out.  I didn't love the smell nor did I think the conditioner was that wonderful.  I normally use Deva products, but wanted to switch things up.  I have to say in the end, I will stick with the Deva product line.",2
3,"overall good, but the heading of \\""spray and play\\"" made me think it might not hold too stiff, but it does hold pretty hard...not crunchy or anything but not as soft a hold as I was hoping for...but that is probaly me since it doesn't claim to be a soft hold.  I'd say its def a product to set a style rather than to spray and play...hope that helps some",2
3,"just got my polish, it covers good being that it china glaze, but I knew once out the package, this wasn't the color in the pic, and even now I just put my painted thumb against the pic ^ right there, and the color is not even close, its more of the popular color this year mint green teal kinda. looks like an old wall paper color from the 80s. it looks like tiffany blue, if tiffany blue had mint green in it, arrived on time",2
3.0,"The product it self was nice, but damn did that hurt. I decided it was not for me and returned it.",2
3,". . . well, let's be honest here.  It works, and it smells nice, and all that.  It's scented vaseline, my friends.  Of COURSE it works.  But I have to admit once I realized it's basically vaseline . . . I was a little less-impressed.<br /><br />You can do the same amazing things for your lips with the 39-ounces-for-$18 vaseline that Amazon sells.",2
3,"I was surprised at how many of these came in the pack!  They should last me forever!  My only negative is that the foam tips are thin and the hard plastic pokes through, which doesn't feel great when applying your eyeshardow...  Lots of bank for the buck as long as you can tolerate the hard plastic feel when applying....",2
3,"It was a little too large for my taste and could not get my waist length hair around it properly, so I gave it away to someone with shorter hair.  She liked it.",2
3,"I've worn the sock for ove a week  (every night) so far and haven't noticed any difference, but I'm hopeful. I think the sock is expensive for just getting one. Let's hope it works to relieve my plantar fasciitis.",2
3,Good,2
3.0,"I was so excited to find this product.  It has been very difficult for me to find it in any store or salon.  It was fine at first but before the can was even remotely empty it was coming out like water and I could not use it.  I was going to continue to buy from this seller, the same product, 2 at a time since I couldn't find it anywhere else, but I unfortunately had to change my mind.",2
3,The product- magnesium flakes are very good. Only problem was that the bottle was opened and some of the flakes were spilled into the box when I received it in the mail. Better packaging and I would have given a higher review. Overall good.,2
3,"The title says it all. I used it for a week and noticed a few main things:<br />1. Its a complicated 3 step process (I'm pretty simple and a wash and moisturize is about as involved as I'd like to get on a daily basis).<br />2. It made my eyes crust over in the morning. When I stopped using it, the eye crust stopped in the AM. I rarely ever get eye crust, even when I fall asleep with make up on.<br />3. I broke out in zits on my forehead and chin. I haven't had acne like this since my 20's.<br /><br />So I didn't use it long enough to give a full review. I'll still use it occasionally, since it's so expensive. As far as a nightly regiment, it's not for me, as I think over-use of this system caused my skin to be too heavy and I broke out. I stopped using it and went back to another Philosophy moisturizer and that worked fine, and my potential break out vanished.",2
3,"so far its good machines for the  beginner. i have only tried it 2 times and it seems to be fun. not much down time, due to moving.<br />will try to get more practice in and write a better rating.<br /><br />thanks",2

IN ORDER TO RECEIVE MY PACKAGE I HAD TO PAY AN ADDITIONAL  37,42 EUR( 48 DOLLARS MORE) FOR THE EUROPEAN CUSTOM FEES ON THIS ARTICLE INCLUDING AN ADDITIONAL CUSTOM DELIVERY FEES...THIS WAS THE MOST EXPENSIVE PERFUME I EVER BOUGHT IN MY LIFE, 228 US DOLLARS...WARNING FOR EUROPEANS BUYING PERFUMES WITH OVERSEAS COUNTRIES",2

3,"I just received my nail order of two sets of the Nicedeco White Special Plush Material False Full-Well Acrylic Fashion 3D nails.<br /><br />The Pros:<br />1. The product arrived well packaged and right on time.<br />2. The right amount was included in each package (no glue is included, but they do not say there is, either).<br /><br />The Cons:<br />1. They are covered with a white furry flocking that I wasn't expecting.  I guess that is what they meant by &#34;Special Plush Material&#34;.  So, for me, I will have to file down all the surfaces of every nail, or, throw these out.  I was just looking for a white, soft and flexible full-cover nail, which these are, but I'm not sure that it is worth my time to remove all of the flocking on every nail in order to wear. Some nail aficionados may like the flocked look, but it is just not my style.<br /><br />So, I am unsure how to rate this.... was this my mistake for not understanding their description or theirs for not describing it to my satisfaction.",2
3,"This is a good daily facial cleanser, not too rough, doesn't foam up, not too strong as an exfoliating cleanser.",2
3.0,"Good palette,mpigmentation osnt so great but overall I am happy with those",2
3,"My eyes are normally OK and I just ignore them.  Sometimes they get super dry and itchy, which is when I tend to use eye cream.  This product has an odd smell, but I kind of like it.  I don't know if it helps me though.",2
3,"This product is really awesome! I'm using it everyday or I've been using it for more than a year. I can recommend this product 100% to my friends, but problem is the packaging it is very bad.",2
3,"I was interested to try this product because I have been making my own rosehip seed oil-based facial serum for many years and can attest to the benefits of my own concoction, at least. (Organic rosehip, argan, tamanu, pomegranate seed oils and aromatherapy grade essential oils are pricey but worth it for the results I have experienced.) The L'Oreal serum does not specify that the oils used are organic or cold pressed. The packaging is very nice; I'd love to find a source for the heavy glass dropper bottle. I was disappointed to see that the first three ingredients are chemically based, but at least they are generally recognized as safe. They include Caprylic Capric Triglycerides, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, and Isononyl Isononoate. The fourth and fifth ingredients are rosehip oil and jojoba oil, followed by essential oils, and then a few other ingredients and chemicals. The amazon label obscured most of the last ingredients and removed the ink when I peeled it back to read. The ones I was able to research seem to be regarded generally as safe. Since rosehip and jojoba are both fairly pricey oils, I would assume that most of what you are putting on your skin is the first three ingredients. It has a light dry feel that is characteristic of the esters listed first. The essential oils used are good for skincare and are interspersed with other ingredients like corn oil and capryloyl salicylic acid (which probably helps keep acne at bay). The scent is problematic for me, primarily because of the citronelle (think mosquito candles). It does fade to a more pleasant, somewhat earthy odor, after some time, but I have a great collection of niche fragrances and I prefer to scent myself. Even in my own serum, I mask the stronger smelling ingredients with rose otto, neroili, jasmine, sandalwood and frankincense oils and the like. Those -- along with a higher proportion of oils like rosehip, argan, tamanu over the coconut oils esters, would make this serum much more expensive. This is alightweight, easily absorbed oil that would be good for those who have dry, mature skin that can benefit from a little boost, and don't mind a somewhat strong fragrance.",2
3,My daughter had used this item and raved about it.  I was able to purchase this item on line.  It arrived quickly and my hair now looks so much better.,2
3,Item arrived as promised. The clip isn't holding hair as tightly because the spikes on the clip are half-cut. Overall nice quality though with bright purple accent stones.,2
3,I have had this for about 3 weeks and have used it twice.  I haven't seen any noticeable changes in that time period.<br /><br />It burns after about 3 minutes.,2
3,"I dislike the inaccuracy of the color displayed online. The soft cinnamon is more of a brownish, cooperish color. Not a dark red brown as depicted in photo. I originally bought this to offset another one of the same brand because the red was a bit too orangey for me. I wont be buying anymore lip color online unless I've seen it in person before.<br /><br />Product does feel nice and glides smoothly on my lips. Feather lightweight feel, with great pigment.",2
3.0,"I recently had a laser procedure on my face. The doctor suggested i buy a make-up with a green base to neutralize the redness on my face.. I did not want to use a heavy cover-up liquid make-up for fear of getting an infection. I went with this powder. The powder is okay, it does it's job.<br /><br />If your a very active person, you must reapply often. I am very athletic and tend to run-around a lot. My face occasionally perspires and that means I must reapply. I still prefer the powder to heavy make-up. I would definitely suggest this powder over heavy face make-up after a laser procedure.",2
3.0,"I have mild roseacea and very dry skin. This is a good product, but doesn't help with redness. I use it during the day because I have such dry skin. It doesn't relieve any redness but does keep my face moisturized for the day.",2
3,"I bought this make up on recommendation of a friend that loves the product.  I am not in love but it is a good product.  The color is off from what I expected with the Barely Beige being too light for me and too yellow.  The packaging is not a good design.  If you shake out too much, the lid is too shallow to store it so you end up wasting it.  The coverage is serious and the powder is extra finely milled so it is silky and smooth.  Again, a good product but not right for me.",2
3,Its non invasive and neutral to the skin . But its not a good thing always. I didn't find much change to my skin after using this for some time.,2
3,"I have always purchased this in a Department Store.  The cellophane wrapper wasn't sealed in the usual tight way.  The perfume doesn't quite have the scent I'm used to, its either old, or lost some of its original good scent in the 'process',<br /> since it wasn't sealed the way I'm used to, I have to wonder, I won't order this through Amazon again.",2
3,"I ordered for my sister so I don't use them, but when I look at her face, it looks like her skin got smoother/cleaner.",2
3,"It's an ok product, but they don't tell you the ingredients.  It has several types of parabens in it.",2
3,"Within 7 days of receiving this dryer, the plastic hinge broke.  Yes, plastic hinge.  Why it's not made of a sturdier material like metal is beyond me.    Thankfully, the vendor replaced it quickly. But I won't be buying this make or model again.",2
3,I JUST BOUGHT THIS TO GO WITH SEVERAL HAIR CARE ITEMS FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER.  SHE LIKES IT SO I GUESS THAT'S WHAT WAS IMPORTANT.,2
3,"I tan a lot but tanning the face is tricky. I don't expect much but this was suppose to give at least a \\""glow\\""...and didn't deliver. I'm also not a fan of the strong sunscreen scent. On the upside, my skin drinks this up and my skin stays moisturized throughout the day.",2
3,"Was expecting the pan stik to be the same size as the ones I've been getting for years, but it's alot smaller.  Plus the color did not match what I normally get - it is lighter.  It does however go on smoothly like the other I've gotten",2
3,It just ok,2
3,Its okay for what I use it for not daily. I think I need the brush kind and stronger cleansing tool,2
3,"It doesn't prevent wrinkles, sleep wrinkles unfortunately still form overnight yet maybe it can help to prevent already existing ones from getting deeper. Will continue using it at night although the pillow case gets stained rather quickly by the skin care products, i would just have to ignore that fact as its impossible to wash it every day.",2
3,Its ok. The suction could be better.,2
3,"I re-ordered this moisturizer because you really can't beat the price for the quality and amount you get (it lasts forever), however, they must have changed the formula because this feels super thick/greasy compared with the last container I used. I'm actually using the sea buckthorne night moisturizer for day, since that feels lighter than this day moisturizer. Sad!",2
3,I ordered this color because I had it before and LOVED it.  When I got this bottle my nails still had the same color on from a different bottle. The color was completely different. Disappointing.,2
3,"This is a nice little moisturizer for the summer months.<br />Yes, it's a little sticky at first before it completely absorbs, but that goes away, without any sticky or greasy feeling at all once it's compleyely absorbed! You get a HUGE tub of it for a great price!",2
3,I mix this with a color of loose powder because it lightens my skin a lot.,2
3,"It doesn't do anything to sooth your eyes, and it doesn't even reduce redness, but luckily it stings really bad when you apply it.<br /><br />If you're wondering what my pain tolerance is; I enjoy using an epilator, and have teenager children that I love.",2
3,smells a bit synthetic when u first spray it but quickly gets sexy when it drys down,2
3,"I've always wanted a full-sized Waterpik but had to settle for smaller travel-sized versions because of non-existent counterspace.  My current/previous dental irrigator is a travel Panasonic model that has only one type of tip and a a barely adjustable flow.<br /><br />Now that I have actual bathroom counter space, I can have and enjoy using a real oral irrigator.  I love how there is a larger liquid capacity, different tips to clean more thoroughly and of course a handy little place to store all those tips in the lid.<br /><br />I am very happy with this Waterpik and would not hesitate to buy it at MSRP.  I have no other experience with this brand's other products or other full-sized oral irrigators so cannot compare.",2
3,"Decent grooming kit for the price.  Bought as a gift for my brother-in-law, and he seems to like it ok.",2
3,Very beautiful wig looks just like the picture I love it,2
3,It still has somewhat of a smell. It does not make you skin feel greasy after using it. It's okay,2
3,not the best dragons blood i've used.,2
3,Curlers were not what I thought.  After a while they gave my hair very little curl.  I most likely will not purchase this product again.,2
3,"This is a wonderful product that suffers from poor packaging. The color is wonderful, it goes on nicely. However, I shortly found myself picking up a segment of the pencil from the counter. I tried to smoosh it back with the rest, with little success. In the end, I didn't get enough use from this cosmetic to consider it worthwhile. I am certainly hoping that Maybelline will redesign the packaging, because the Master Smoky Shadow Pencil is really a five-star item, in a one-star package.",2
3,Good,2
3,Love it. It blends in perfectly with my concealer and the rest of my makeup. Thinking about trying the other products from Ben,2
3,"I'm torn on this review, because this is the second of these I have purchased in the last 3 years.  My first one was truly the only fogless solution I've ever purchased.  The issue on this newest one appears to be a slow leak where the mirror meets the frame.  It causes a drop of water to run down the mirror every couple of seconds.",2
3,"I was overtly impressed with this product.  It's a little stiff, and the fragrance, not so memorable.  I have used better scrubs..",2
3,"This is the first time that I purchased this and had it sent to me. The product works really well (the best deodorant I've ever used).  I would have ranked it at 5* if it didn't come damaged.  If you have used this product before, you know that if you drop one it can redistribute the deodorant in the casing.  This is due to the fact that it is a soft solid.  When I received the 6, all 6 were redistributed to one side of the casing which makes it more difficult to use.  I don't know how this could have been prevented, but you do see these in the store without this problem.  So if stores can figure out how to not damage the product, I think Amazon can as well.<br /><br />Will this impact my purchase of this in the future?  It depends on price point.  If the savings via amazon is >$3 for the 6, then yes.  If not, then no.",2
3,ok,2
3,"It's an alright lotion. One of the more oily types. I have keratosis pelaris and was recommended this since it had urea and lactic acid in it (helps with KP), but I really don't see any difference with this stuff. It's done decently otherwise. I probably am going to switch lotions after this bottle empties up, but it's not really a \\""bad\\"" lotion, just not for me.",2
3,"I actually really like the smell of it, but i didn't notice it making any sort of difference on my skin. I do reuse the pads approx three times before throwing them out. I just set it on top of the jar after use and let it dry out. Honestly, I'll probably end up throwing the jar into my camping gear and use it as a handy face cleanser in the woods.",2
3,"I really, really liked this shampoo. However, they just changed the formula and took out a bunch of the great natural ingredients and added in some less natural ones. The front of the bottle now says 97% natural where it used to say 99%.<br /><br />I contacted the company about it and got a pretty unhelpful standard response:<br /><br />&#34;Thank you for your feedback of the Yes to Carrots Shampoo.  We have reformulated this product.  We’ve taken a look at the ever changing natural ingredient landscape and decided that some of the ingredients no longer fit into our strict set of formulation guidelines.  Our commitment is to provide you with top quality natural products that meet our strictest natural standard.<br /><br />Additionally, I will pass along your feedback to our product development team so they are aware.  It is customers like you that help us make better products.&#34;<br /><br />Also, they say it is the &#34;same feel&#34; but it really doesn't feel the same on my hair. I'm hoping I can find a bottle of the old formula somewhere in that lovely light orange color, but after that, I'm going to be finding a new brand that hasn't sold out it's naturalness. :/",2
3,"This is a good hair color but it does not cover all of the grey hair as it claims on the package. I like the color, I just wish it did cover all of the grey.",2
3,"Like OPI, but this one didn't work well....peeled easily.",2
3,"I decided to use both Olay Regenerist Daily Serum (Fragrance-free)and Olay Regenerist Eye Serum on ONE SIDE OF MY FACE, applied morning and night, for 3 months. I figured I could compare my skin quality, wrinkles, etc. on the Regenerist side against the side of my face on which I used no product at all. After 3 months, I noticed absolutely no difference on either side. As such, I can't say that these products have delivered on the anti-aging properties they tout. I'm 55 years old with generally good skin quality, but wrinkles would be nice to be rid of.    Their claims include:\\""Helps regenerate your skin's appearance without such drastic measures as chemical peels, cosmetic surgery or laser....Hydrates for firmer, visibly lifted, and younger looking skin without drastic measures. Instantly the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles is softened and your skin's texture is improved. Over time your skin will be visibly firmer and more elastic.\\""      None of this occurred in the 3 month test I did. So, why am I giving it 3.5 stars and still planning to use it? Because I have super-sensitive eyes that tend to burn and get irritated with most makeup and skincare products. Olay is in that rare group that I can tolerate. Also, I find that it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, goes on light, doesn't cause sneezing (fragrance free), and allows for extremely smooth makeup application when used under makeup.",2
3.0,It was great. Great color :),2
3,"I cannot find this item I may have received it, but I don't recall.",2
3,"I really wish that it had an automatic shut-off for the times that I forget to un-plug it.  It is slower to heat up than my other products like this and only has two heat settings, but otherwise it works well.",2
3,I like the oil for my hair but the smell isn't as good as I thought. The vanilla scent is way better. Delivery was great.,2
3,"This would work on a back with thin straight hair.  On a man with curly, thick hair, it pulls and hurts.  It does have a suprising amount of juice despite running on only two AA batteries.  Blade is sharp and might work well for a woman who cannot reach down to shave her legs.",2
3,"my friend told me this one is very good, and I purchased it. but it just not what I expected......",2
3.0,Not a great difference from the extra coarse. I'd expected a bit more.,2
3,"I bought this sunscreen based on the low toxicity and chemicals in this sunscreen and based on its good rating on the EWG.<br /><br />It worked okay on my bigger kids, but it was very ineffective on my baby.  He is a red head with the extremely fair skin to go with it.  With only 30 minutes in the sub, he was still fried with a persistent sunburn.",2
3,Motor didn't seem too strong. Liked the shape and adjustability. Waterproof and in the shower is awesome,2
3,Shipped in a protected box...arrived on time and brand new just like how you would receive it in store.....cleaner is bit expensive,2
3,"While the Fekkai Technician Color Care Mask worked well to soften my hair, it did nothing for keeping it from feeling dried out. My hair gets very dry and brittle when colored and so I need an extra strength hydrating conditioner for it. I thought this might be the mask for me. Sadly, I have not seen any results with it helping me keep my color either. So disappointing in that respect. Smells nice. Good thick conditioner consistency. Didn't bother my sensitive scalp. I've come to expect more from the Fekkai line and this product did not live up to expectations.",2
3.0,"Honestly, I was hoping for a better scent... Wanted to try them out because they offer subscribe & save, but they missed the mark. I love Burt's Bees cucumber and sage wipes and will switch back to those.",2
3,It's a good product.  I just never could find time to use them. Someone with free time may have success.,2
3,"So far, of the Pravana colors I've tried (blue, magenta and this), this one runs the most. I love the way it looks on my hair but it's left the most stains on towels, tubs, skin and clothes.",2
3,The masks do not fit that well on my face but they work well at hydrating and I love the packaging,2
3,The mirror broke fairly easily. But I still use it so I obviously don't hate it haha. It's exactly what it looks like in the picture.,2
3,"Should be longer -- on my Clarks resole project it proved about half an inch short.  Considering you adhere these using one-shot contact cement, DIY'ers need an oversize sole in case positioning is a little off.  On the positive side, the excess material is easy to trim with scissors and a.belt sander.  This might also mean that the sole material abrades easily -- I'll have to were them awhile to judge this.",2
3,"This product is fine, but nothing like my old Norelco that I had for years.",2
3,"PACKAGE have it, 111wq",2
3,"This is very inexpensive and sort of feels it. While it does a pretty good job of trimming my beard, it sometimes pulls which doesn't feel too good. Charge lasts a long time and I do like that it works while plugged in, unlike a lot of other trimmers. For the money you probably can't do better, but it's not top quality.",2
3,"This is a 'meh' mascara. I first got in back in 2010 (before it was discontinued) in the non-waterproof version, and I absolutely loved it. It separated my lashes, defined them, and lengthened them beautifully. I bought the waterproof version last year and wasn't as impressed. It clumped up more easily to the point I had to use a spoolie brush to separate my lashes. Removing it was a pain too. I didn't have any problems with flaking or anything in the non-waterproof version and this one took a lot more effort to get off my lashes. The one downside both had in common was that the battery died before I ran out of the mascara. I've since switched to Bare Minerals Flawless Definition mascara and it gives me the same (perhaps a bit better) beautifully lengthened and defined lashes that the non-waterproof version of this gave me, and with even less effort.",2
3,"These are the studs that you get when getting your ears pierced. They are sterilized (before you open them) stainless steel. They seem to be the only kind that do not irritate my ear lobes. Delivery was faster than a speeding bullet, and they were exactly as described and look really good. But, the shipping and handling price made me gasp. I almost changed my mind.  Since I was ordering 12 pair, I bit the bullet.  Out of curiosity, I weighed the package on my postal scale. It did not weigh a pound and parcel post cost for one pound was $5.38. My daughter and granddaughters want their birthstones.  I looked to see what this seller's S&H was for one pair of earrings, and they want the same $9.95. Has anyone heard of postage gouging?  If you can afford it, buy them.  My rating is based on the shipping cost.",2
3,Purchased for &#34;chemo&#34; hair. &#34;Extremely&#34; soft bristled - not sure what good this would be for any other purpose.,2
3,"It may be my fault for not being a fan of this product: I'm not sure on how I may use it. I got this hoping that it will be a kind of glittery silver liner and it is not. It is just a uniform metallic silver color which is nice enough, but I feel that it doesn't look nice on my eyes on its own. Maybe I should try layering this on top of black liner, but as of now, I can't find a use for it. Otherwise, it seems s decent product and even if I find no use for it, I only paid $1 for it on the ELF website, so no big deal.",2
3,"I followed the directions and could not turn my black hair beach blond after 45 minutes.  My hair was more of an orange/light tan color.  If you have black or dark brown hair, I would recommend buying at least two of these for total beach blond.",2
3,"I will edit when I've used a little longer, but so far, I'm not super impressed.  It smells wonderful, but when I spray it in my hair when it's dry, it seems to make it kind of sticky, and it looks greasy.  I tried it when my hair was damp, and it seems to lessen that, but doesn't really do much for my curl.  I really wanted to be able to use it to freshen up my hair while dry.",2
3,"I've never used something like this before so I don't know how good it is compared to the other ones. But it works pretty nice. Makes my face hurt, but it could be because I have bad sensitive skin to start with. Overall, it's pretty good. But there are cheaper ones out there if you're looking for dupes of clairsonic stuff.",2
3,Took about a week longer to ship and the white part tends to fall off but you can put it back on. You might want to hair spray your hair before you put the curlers on because they they flop down but when I hair sprayed them they looked beautiful.,2
3,"I have been applying this product every other day since I received it 8 days ago. As a nurse, I wash my hands frequently and use an alcohol foam multiple times a day between washes. My nails become dry, form ridges, peel, chip, and break. I have been using Sally Hanson Hard as Nails with some success. Since using the Lipmann my nails are cracking, peeling, and braking at such a rate that I am discontinuing use of the Lipmann immediately and returning to Sally Hanson. I have no idea why I thought paying more money would mean a better product.",2
3,Will try another bran so I can make a comparison. I was not impressed,2
3,"I got this white Macbook mirror not to long ago and it is great! While it did come with scratches on the front, the inside mirror itself is awesome. It's a perfect gag gift or just a great small mirror.",2
3,I used to use this moisturizer every day when my face was clear and acne-free.  However I have struggled with adult acne for the past few years and this moisturizer did not have the same effect it once did.  It has a wonderful smell but sometimes goes on 'wet'.  It doesn't feel like my skin absorbs the moisture as well as I'd like it to.  I think it is an affordable cream and would work best for someone who doesn't have sensitive/dry/acne prone skin.,2
3,"Helps somewhat with wrinkles, but doesn't reduce them as much as I would have thought.  For the price though, not a bad buy.",2
3,"I have been using the conditioner on my daughter's hair for about 2.5 weeks and her hair smells great, but the ends still get pretty tangled. It is better than when she didn't have the conditioner, but her ends still feel very dry. I am planning to give her ends a hair cut and continue using the conditioner. Will update on the progress or lack of at a later date...",2
3,I really can't see any difference in my wife's skin color.,2
3,"This is a good styling dryer, but it IS NOT a good hair dryer.  It will not replace your standard hair dryer.  You need to have your hair mostly dry or it will take you forever (unless you have VERY short hair).",2
3,"I'm giving it the rating I am, because it is not what pictured.<br /><br />This wig comes up with the searches &#34;platinum blonde&#34;, &#34;white blonde&#34;, &#34;light blonde&#34;, and &#34;blonde&#34;.<br /><br />The image also shows a whitish blonde wig.  So wouldn't you think maybe a blonde wig? At least I was lead to believe so...<br /><br />However, upon receiving the item, it isn't blonde at all, it's a white wig.<br /><br />This goes to show the image can't be trusted, however it is a nice white wig and I am a fan of the wigs taobaopit offers having owned now 4 of them. They work beautifully for cosplay.<br /><br />I'm sure eventually I can use this wig. But for now, it will just sit around.",2
3,I am not thrilled but it is about what I expected. . .Good for the price  My hair is very short,2
3,"I wouldn't use this brush as a normal everyday brush. It pretty much does the job, but doesn't blend . Its too stiff. I would recommend using a Kabuki brush instead.  Bottom Line: This should only be used as a emergency brush. For when you have no other option. But using your fingers would blend better than this brush honestly -_-",2
3,"The shipping was super fast which I liked a lot but it came a little damaged. On one side a piece of it was cracked off and I had to super glue that piece back on which worked for now. And another thing is that the nail polish rack in the picture is not the same nail polish rack that I received. The one that they sent me was this one [[ASIN:B0052G15UG Nail Polish Table Rack Display (Hold Up To 144 Bottles) Spinable]] which I was a little disappointed about because I really liked the one in the picture more. And I had also seen it on a video on YouTube which made me decide to buy it in the first place. And to the people who also bought the nail polish rack too, I would really like to know if you actually received the nail polish rack in the picture or got a different one like me?",2
3.0,"I like it okay. But the scent is a bit overwhelming, perhaps a tad off-putting. I'm unsure what exactly blue tansy smells like on its own, but it seems the lavender and orange scents come through quite strongly.<br /><br />I did read a bit of information on blue tansy its uses and as an essential oil in general, and it does contain quite impressive properties for healing.<br /><br />Badger balm products are great for moisturizing the skin, especially the face and any dry spots.",2
3,"Again super small but they were soft and pretty well made, havnt had any issues with them so far, I",2
3,"For me, this lip balm lasts for about 2 hrs or less. It's good for on the go, and moisturizes fairly fast when applied. However, this lip balm leaves me desiring something a little more lasting, because I work very long days, and often in harsh environments.",2
3,You pay exactly for what you get.,2
3,Works well.  Fun to do but time consuming ....takes an hour to complete a full set if nails.  U don't get exactly the same patterns that are shown in picture.  I only like two of the patterns I was sent,2
3,good deal but I'm not crazy about these razors. Not as smooth for shaving as I am used to,2
3,didn't clear up the toe fungus as I had thought,2
3,"Adequate is really the best description for this. If I had no other concealer it would do the job, but it's just too chalky looking that nothing seems to fix. It's definately some heavy duty concealer and was a really great idea, but the actual application just falls flat.     The slender end looks like skin toned eyeliner and is great for tracing around nostrils or getting right up against the lower lash lines. The thicker side is too thick for small spaces, but not quite big enough to cover large areas wtihout using it all up. The large end looks like it was intended to cover dark circles, but it's so dry that it tugs at the skin. On top of that, this concealer is THE WORST I have ever seen about collecting in fine lines.     I am just starting to get fine lines around my eyes. When I put this concealer under my eyes you'd have thunk I was 100 with lines around my eyes. I eye tried eye primer with serums to plump and all that jazz and still lines.     Color is pretty great. I have a hard time finding a shade that will match my skin tone and this one blends in pretty well.",2
3,I like this as a moiusturizer<br />its really greasy<br />I don't feel it did anything as far as for a primer<br />for lip color I guess i'll try it again,2
3.0,"The roller set is quick to heat and there are enough rollers for my hair (just past shoulder length, pretty fine, lots of layers). I'm hardly a professional, and was hoping hot rollers would be simple enough that I could set, cool, and go. While my hair was more voluminous than usual, the staying power (with a setting spray) wasn't incredible. I'd definitely believe that this is due to my hair, rather than the product -- even professional stylists can't get my hair to hold a curl.<br /><br />I would like to note that the product description is inaccurate -- rather than coming with \\""20 wire hair clips,\\"" as advertised, the set came with large plastic clips which leave noticeable crimps in my hair.<br /><br />Oh well... maybe Dolly Parton hair just isn't attainable for me :(",2
3,"Similar consistency to chap stick- covers well, but almost too moisturizing for my normal skin. If you have dry skin you will probably really like it.",2
3,"I purchased this product around four years ago and it's still halfway full. It does a great job of cleaning my makeup brushes and it doesn't leave any harsh odors on the brush when I pick it up for its next use. However, I give it only 3 stars because it is way too expensive. You can get a similar product much cheaper at your local convenience store. I don't think it's necessary to spend $15 extra dollars on a product just because it is made by MAC even if it does exactly what it is supposed to do.",2
3,Did not know they were (sheer) see through,2
3.0,I didn't see any results. Maybe 2 weeks is not enough time like they say. Also the lotion was very watery. Not sure if its suppose to be that way.,2
3,"They bend nicely and seam relatively strong, but i do not think these would last incredibly long if you used it frequently.  I was given these as a gift, but only used them a few times, so i do not know how well they last long term.  For immediate use they seem to work well enough.",2
3,"Delivery was fast. However, the smell of the perfume needs a bit getting used too.<br />Would not buy this again.",2
3,"I had high hopes, but it is very hard to put on because it is so waxy. I much prefer O'Keefe's Working Hands which really makes my hands feel great, very moisturizing, and absorbs quickly. This product reminds me of a hair product I use to help calm frizzy hair",2
3,Both pumps on the bottles were broken when they arrived. After reading some other reviews it seems like this problem was not unique to me. It was insufficiently packaged to protect the pumps. I'm disappointed that for such an expensive product such little care was taken to ensure that they would arrive in tact at their destination.,2
3,"It is highly pigmented so a little goes a long way. It goes on smoothly.<br />However, it is NOT smudge-proof. It runs on the sides of my eyes when I tear up.  And it smudges a little bit around my eyes, which was disappointing.",2
3,It's cute and worth the $5 I paid for it. Pretty large so it will hold my big round brush and full size shampoo bottles for traveling.,2
3,"I have purchased this product in the past from Amazon and loved it. This time the jar arrived in bubble wrap, with no box and no seal.The jar is full and the content looks and smells like the real stuff, but I can't help wondering if somebody has already put her fingers in it (yes, I am that squeamish). Of course it could just be that the original box somehow got damaged or it was removed to fit the jar in a smaller shipping box, in which case a little note would have been nice. I will probably start using the cream as a hand moisturizer until I relax enough to put it on my face.",2
3,I bought this for  my six year old. it was not sealed  in any way and the box looked like a sticker price  was removed.,2
3,This makes my arm pits raw and burn BUT maybe just me . I don't use it anymore,2
3,I've not used any other shampoo for hair pieces but seems to lather easily and rinse well.  Would recommend to others.,2
3,"im not even sure if it worked when i used it, i did not sweat for a while but i did anyway eventually,",2
3,the color is not as expected,2
3,not for me but my friend loves it,2
3,"Maybe it works well, but I used a Living Proof sample before this. I wish I would have just bought Living Proof. It thickened but felt sorta weird.",2
3,"It's very-very strong in smell - for my tastes too strong - I also have the accompanying body lotion and it, too, is very strong and I only use it very so often.  I'd not get this again nor would I pass on as a gift in the future either.",2
3,It seems to be helping.,2
3,"Danielle Enterprises Touch Button Satin Nickel Led Lighted Mirror, would get a higher rating if it produced more light, as it seems well made.",2
3,"Very bad finish at the welt of the needles, can be more carefully welded!!",2
3,"This fragrance is nice for the price. My first impression was a slight sophistication of strong citrus, that was semi-sweet, but not cloying or synthetic, with a crisp sillage. Furthermore this slightly resembles Wings or Nautica Blue, however it is more mature than NB, without feeling totally like another cheap citrus. If you enjoy Wings or NB you may want to sample this one. While I think it's a pleasant scent it's not overly original, to some it may have no appeal at all. Though its still a cheapy worth trying.",2
3,I thought would be like most of Versace's  fragrances but actually this is a very mild almost sweet fragrance.<br />it's okay but never again for me.,2
3,Even though the photo of the product shows a glove- it doesn't bring it. Has that been a problem for any of the users? The glove that is sold by Amazon separately has bad reviews. Has anyone been able to find a Herstyler glove?,2
3,not bad,2
3,"Great for straightening difficult hair, but Maxiglide products seems to have mechanical issues.  I have used Maxiglide straighteners for years and each one I purchased had to be sent back to the manufacturer for repair, which they did with no question.  But it should last more than a few months without issues.  The one I just purchased from Amazon started having issues after a month (blue light constantly blinks)-can't return to Amazon, but will have to return to manufacturer.",2
3,"I have always used Fake Bake Flawless because of its simple application and really good color.  I love the smell too, kind-of beachy.  I have to re-apply every other day, but it dries in about five minutes.",2
3,"Great little travel brush to help keep you clean. The brush is VERY soft, so don't expect a deep clean/exfoliation. Use this with a gentle cleanser to really give your skin a break from everything harsh in life. I love that this brush comes with its own little case. It sits upside down in the case so any excess moisture drains from the brush (which is necessary for the life of a brush), and the case has tiny drainage holes in the bottom to relieve the excess moisture. It's brilliant packaging! It is, however, plastic so don't just throw it around without care. Overall great, but don't buy this expecting it to really get deep down or to remove any major dirt. I use after an oil cleanser, with another soap-free/gentle cleanser.",2
3,"Not quite what I wanted , the Aussie I wanted was moonless night .",2
3,Did not arrive with instructions.,2
3,"I ordered this in early September and by mid-October the anti-tippers and belt STILL had not gotten to me (despite 2 separate phone calls, and being assured they were on the way).  As of the beginning of November still not here.  If you need the anti-tippers (ie. if you have no one to help push you EVERY time) I really can not recommend this chair, though the chair itself is a good one - sturdy, and comfortable.<br /><br />This is an update: As of the beginning of June 2012, we still have not received the belt and anti-tippers.  Again the chair itself, sans belt and anti-tippers, is a very good chair and has worked very well.  Still would not recommend.",2
3,"ok to start off, shipping was excellent ordered it and two days later there it was. now to the real topic, this cologne is not for the average male i would say. first off, it more feminine then you would think and is quite strong (one spray is usually all i use). secondly, its very fruity and not much of a wood tone.",2
3,Looks like Barby hair.  Is what it is.  The clip holds in good.  Good for kids to play dress up with.,2
3,Bought this for my niece-dog's skin problems. Started off great but she quickly turned her nose up to it. Easy to use dropper was nice to drizzle the oil over the food. Might start using it for myself.,2
3,Not what I thought it would like I wont buy again....The color is not high intensity its like a see thru lip gloss not good quality...,2
3,"It hurts to wear, and it's really unnecessary, really. I don't know what I was expecting, to be completely honest.",2
3,"I do love the smell of Old Spice, especially the deodarant.  I use the stuff religiously.  I don't use the after-shave, because I prefer an alcohol-free alternative for my face.  This body wash shares the same scent, which is invigorating in the shower.  The after-scent may be a bit to strong.  My wife commented on it after I showered the other day.  She likes the deodarant, but thought the body wash left me smelling of it too strongly.  Also, using the body wash doesn't feel like it's getting me as clean as normal soap or gel.  The lather is also kind of light and airy, not the thicker, richer feel of a more expensive alternative.  That said, I'll use the entire bottle.  Whether I order it again after finishing this bottle is still a question.",2
3,I received a three pack of these as a promotion from Schick and I found these razors provide a very close and quick shave. My face was left very smooth with no razor burn. On the down side I found that the razor felt bulky and hard to trim with even with the flip down moisturize strip. I would however recommend this razor to anyone who likes multiple blades. Its just not for me. I'll stick to twin blades razors.,2
3,"TIGI products are great. I will not deny that. This particular product is very smelly. If you have chemical sensitivity this is not the product for you. Despite the smelliness, it does an excellent job of keeping my mohawk up all day. When my hair starts to relax I simply remold my hair using the product that is already in my hair and I am good to go.<br /><br />If you are chemically sensitive and want a pomade for your hair, buy the TIGI Bed Head stick: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NRXYM/ref=oh_details_o09_s00_i00",2
3,"I LIKE THE SMELL AND INGREDIENTS, I'M NOT CERTAIN IF IT DETANGLES THAT GREAT, BUT I DID NOTICE I DIDN'T LOSE AS MUCH HAIR WHEN I WASHED AND COMBED MY VERY THICK KINKY NATURAL HAIR.",2
3,Product as ordered.  Arrived timely.  We are trying anything new. . . .,2
3,"Smelled nice<br />Expected to give me better result, especially since i use it for more than a month..<br />I don't think I will bought it again",2
3,As described.  The inclusion of the screw driver was especially helpful.  There is some concern that the batteries will charge properly because they are NiMH replacing NiCad.  One charge so far seems to be okay.  If no small solder experience/ equipment available don't attempt. It is difficult to remove circuit board and unsolder old batteries and solder new batteries without spreading solder on adjacent terminals.,2
3,"The baby love the color, but it's not the softest brush.<br />I have sensitive gum",2
3.0,This works great. Makes my skin nice and soft. The scent is a little unpleasant though. I wish they would change the scent.,2
3.0,not as sharp and forceful as I'd hoped.,2
3,"I love orange mouthwash, but this one seems to make my breath worse, not better. Maybe it's just my mouth chemistry; I've heard that different mouthwashes work better for different folks.",2
3,My wife and kids have told me for years that I have very dark circles under my eyes.  I read about these and thought that the price was right and should give them a try.  After 10 days of using them regularly I saw no improvement and neither did my family.  I am not going to trash the product because I believe that my problem my be from age and not anything this product can correct.,2
3,"The oval shape of the watch face makes it a little awkward to press the mode buttons on the side, especially if you're trying to do it while running.  It's also a little cumbersome on the wrist.  I do like the strap though, very comfortable and it has a little button at the end of the strap to secure it from flapping around.",2
3,Nothing special. I finally finished the whole thing but honestly will not purchase again. I love lots of other dermalogica products but this one did not do anything for me. Save your money.,2
3,"I made a two item purchase but somehow it was charged and sent separately, so this item alone plus the S&H fees ended up been waaaaaaaaaay expensive. I was so very disappointed.",2
3,"As someone with sensitive skin, thick curly hair, and who is prone to both razor burn and ingrown hairs. I thought this was worth a shot.<br /><br />I was frustrated by the lack of precision in maintaining my beard line, and the fact that without sufficient stubble, I kept missing patches that no matter how many times I went over the spot, I couldn't seem to catch the grains the right way.  That being said, I haven't experienced any razor burn, chafing, or undue dryness from use...I just don't get as clean a shave as I'd like, either.",2
3.0,"It worked all right for the purpose, but the expiration date was very close. It evidenced that the batch was manufactured quit long ago. Normally this kind of hot pads sold at a store have a few years of an expiration date.",2
3,It was an old razor and I haven't really had much experience with this kind of razor.  Though the thought was nice.  Seems cool but beards today are a lot harder to deal with.,2
3,Didn't notice any difference.,2
3,"From the description, I thought this bag would be bigger.  I was still able to use but had to improvise...",2
3,"I guess I should have read closer, and it's sort of obvious, but not all styles of Listerine are antiseptic. This still has a use, but was a bit disappointing.",2
3,"I'm sure it's good quality, just beware of its very distinct smell. Apparently, in its natural form, it's very strong. Hard to explain, but I bought it for making lotion bars, and it left me with an instant trigger headache. I suggest testing a small amount so you don't have the same problem.",2
3,"It has improved my skin tone, but my freckles are still there.  I've been using it for  2 weeks now.  I may have to use this for over a year to see my sun spots go away.  I believe there are better stuff out there for faster results, but does great for complexion and crows feet.",2
3,It works okay..........but I wish it worked better.,2
3,"Haven't seen any difference really I two weeks,",2
3,Just OK,2
3,"I STILL AM NOT SURE WHAT I THINK ABOUT THIS SHAMPOO, I BOUGHT IT UNDER THE PRETENSE THAT IS SMELLS JUST LIKE THE OLD CLAIROL PRODUCT COUNTY HERBAL ESSENCE. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT IT DOESN'T  RESEMBLES THAT FRAGRANCE AT ALL, BUT IT DOES SMELL NICE. IT MAKES MY HAIR FEEL&#34; DIFFERENT&#34;...NOT SURE IF ITS A GOOD OR BAD 'DIFFEREN'T...I WANT TO HAVE MY HAIR STYLIST TRY IT.",2
3,"I bought this a little over a week and am very sad to say that it is just not all what it's cracked up to be. The color pay off just isn't there. I will say that some of the colors do work, like the blacks and dark blues. Then, after that, there are a few colors that you can get to show up decently if you apply them wet (I tried that) or over primer (I have not tried yet). After that, other colors are just useless. I don't care what you do to them. The brights, if that's what attracted you to this product like it did me, FORGET IT! The two hot pinks in this palette that I was most excited about do absolutely nothing. I was able to get some color out of the pink one in the tokyo palette by applying on my lid wet, but I must say that I had to wet the brush,pick up the shadow on it, apply it to lid, and had to do that atleast 7 times scrubbing into the pot to get it to show up and it still wasn't that bright. The blushes are nice, I like them. I like the couple glosses I've tried so far also. Oh, on another note, I will say that the looks I have done with this palette so far have held up most of the day. They do fade some but not bad at all. Two times that I've used this palette and went to sleep with the eye makeup still on, when I wake up, it's still there.     Since purchasing this, I've went on a search to find a colorful palette that really will work and shades with high pigmentation and I am hearing the greatest things about the 120 palette you can get from BH or Coastal Scents (It's the same palette at both stores). It's only $25. It doesn't have the lip glosses or blushes but you do get 120 eyeshadow shades that are true to color and you can get as funky and bright as you want with it.",2
3,"I bought this lotion through the manufacturer. It smells very woodsy, and is much more manly than other lotions which is a good thing. It is relatively mild and healthier than most lotions, but it does have some troubling ingredients. Such as synthetic benzyl alcohol, which is dangerous for infants and mildly irritating (triggers allergies) for adults. And Phenoxyethanol, which the Cosmetic Database rates it as a moderate hazard and notes cancer, allergic reactions, skin, eye and lung irritation, organ and neurotoxicity as possible effects of using products containing it. And Dimethicone which is made from silicone and forms a plastic barrier on your skin over time. Also the lotion is very thin and slightly runny, and a few minutes after applying it, my skin is dry again and I need to apply more. I'd prefer a thicker more moisturizing lotion without the aforementioned hazardous additives.<br /><br />But a major plus is how much lotion you get for your money. 32 ounces per bottle is ALOT of lotion, this bottle will most likely last you all year long.",2
3,"I like the scent, but the bottle sucks. Sometimes it sprays, and sometimes the perfume just drips out. Very annoying!",2
3,"bought and only have used it a handful of times. i have to apply it multiple times to get the color to actual stick. it was glittery for the first application, but then then the glitter went away.",2
3,"I have been using this product for several weeks. I have not noticed any change yet. Also be carful when you squeeze out the gel, you may end up with too much. It clogs up the opening as well.",2
3,"I live on the east coast of the USA and these headbands took a while to get here. When I opened the package, the headbands had a really strange scent. They work well at holding back the hair, but it just smelled a bit strange to me.",2
3,"I got my eyelashes today, and I was supposed to get them September 2nd at the earliest so I was pretty happy. I did not get the glue, also I got all 20 of the pairs they were 2 pairs a box. The only thing with with packaging is that one box was cracked but the eyelashes were not out the box or anything, I didn't get the ones pictures I got #117 which is just some classic looking eyelashes, they are pretty long though. I got them because i'm a beginner with eyelashes, for the price it's okay. Not the worst but not the best. Overall I guess you get what you pay for...",2
3,"As a Breast Cancer survivor this was the type of product I was recommended to use.  This does the job under most circumstances.  Remember, it's not an antiperspirant, just a fragrance free deoderant.",2
3.0,The product itself is not very well made or thought out. But it gets its job done the best it can. I through mine away.,2
3,"I only gave this product 3 stars because I'm not getting the remarkable results with it as I've gotten with Nutraluxe lash enhancer. This is a decent mascara. But, for truly remarkable lengthening - you need to get the Nutraluxe lash enhancer.",2
3,"I love Dermalogica.  This product works well, but I have not seen much of a difference in my skin.  I have seen dramatic improvements in my skin with Dermalogica products such as Multi Vitamin Therafoliant, Dynamic Skin Recovery and Super Rich Repair, but while this product does no harm I have not seen the marked improvement I am used to with Dermalogica.",2
3.0,"Just lotion.  Nothing phenomenal, not bad either.",2
3,I guess it was my mistake when ordering this thumb cover...thought it was a package of 2...must have got confused when shopping around online. Very expensive for just one! It came in a small zip lock bag with a printed label stuck on it. Not even in the package shown on line. I ordered a small which I don't have a large thumb but the only other choice I saw elsewhere was large. Well the next disappointment  was that it is very very tight. I plan on using it during the night to put neosporin on my extremely chapped and raw cuticles due to me picking on them all day. Want to try to heal them and putting a band aid before bed every night is one more task  I wanted to eliminate. Thought this would work with that nice gel inside. I know I won't order another one. Hope I won't have the blood cut off to my thumb with how tight it is. Hope it stretches out some.,2
3,"Lavender is one of my all-time favorite scents, and I have purchased Yardley lavender bath products for many years.  I ordered the Lavender & Rosemary Bath & Shower Gel, but was really looking for just the lavender fragrance.  While this product leaves my skin soft and silky, the scents of lavender and rosemary compete with each other, and I wasn't too fond with the combined fragrance.  Still, the product lives up to its claims to be &#34;skin soothing&#34;, and the fragrance may be appealing to some people.",2
3,This glue really bonds well but attempting to do my own lashes and not anyone else's I cannot prevent myself from crying and my nose running while applying :(,2
3,"Save money and just by isopropyl alcohol, That is all this is.",2
3,Doesn't help at all,2
3,"Good in the am, before the rest of your neocutis regimen, surprised at how much it stings if you get in your eyes. makes it useless for evening makeup removal.",2
3,shipping was slow and after my daughter wore it. It has broken. her dad fixed it once but the second time it broke it could not be fixed.,2
3,"I bought this after hearing such great reviews and after I was finished paying for it I got an e-mail saying that it would take 2-3 1/2 months to be shipped to my house. I was really let down but when I came home today it was waiting for me, it took about a week and a half (which isn't bad at all). I know some people said the \\""scent\\"" wasn't as strong at St. Tropez (which I love!!!) but i can honestly say when I applied it I didn't smell anything. Most if not almost all the color washes off after you shower (same with St. Tropez) but it left a faint bronze look. I don't adore it yet but I don't dislike it either, I'll have to use it more than once to know if I love it or not :)",2
3,This product is on the thick side of oil.  Didn't really care for it. Will keep it for a back up in case I run out of the other.,2
3.0,I bought more thinking they were the long ones. These are short. Pay attention to the length.,2
3,"While I like the product, the way I received it was just wrong. There was no packageing, and when I took the top off, it had been used already!!!!<br />This seller should not be allowed to sell anything, ever.<br /> I  bought the light shade, but will also buy the medium shade to blend together to match my skin tone, BUT I will purchase it from a REPUTABLE seller.",2
3,"As a shaver, I suppose this is as good as you can get with an electric.  I still prefer the old fashioned razor blade and shaving gel method for the closest shave.  Recently, I tried out the bikini trimmer attachment, and it completely tore my bikini area apart.  I bled all over the place.  So, as a close shaver, it's alright, but use extreme caution if you're going to use it as a trimmer.  It might be alright for others, as I have extremely sensitive skin... but I definitely won't be using it that way again.",2
3,LOOKED NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE WHEN RECEIVED.  I guess it's ok for the price.  I hope that they can correct this in the near future.,2
3.0,"Just started using the shampoo and conditioner.  I gave it 3 stars because it is too early to tell if it is working or not, but either way, I like the hair product and the price was reasonable, especially compared to some other hair products in stores and salons.",2

3,"This product blows my mind.. I mean you can instantly see a difference like in a week with your hair. Right now I don't know what I am gonna do with all those other products that I have which was meant to remedy the same problem and also required most of my time to treat and still never worked and for the ones that did work took weeks and more to see results. All I can say is with this product its less hassle...<br />\\""NO MORE SHEDDING! HELLO STRONG & HEALTHY HAIR\\"" going to order the serum and the shampoo for maintenance. I must say it is a wonderful feeling to comb through your hair and not see any shedding?!its amazing.<br /> This is one of the hair Products that you never ever hair about.... but truly truly does works.I mean I was sceptical when I saw alcohol implemented in the ingredients esp. as a leave in treatment? But I guess scientifically the percentage required made some kind of sense.<br />Add it to your hair regimen you will not have any regrets.<br />********<br />New Review June 2013<br />OK! so this product......Is truely a good product but it is not good for relaxed hair unless the hair is in extensions where you can concentrate only on the scalp or new growth cause the alcohol as I presumed did start to damage the relaxed part of my hair by altering the hair strands terribly! It became very brittle and dried out and I started to experience breakage but the weird thing is I had faster and more new growth like an inch growth within a month. But because of that other aspect I refuse to continue...and I had to apply tuns of treatment weekly...to restore the silkiness to bring some health restoration to the hair.  I think it would do better on other hair types that is not as porous due to a relax treatment. While the product might be a good one it is Seriously not good for relaxed hair",2
3,it's my first time to use an in-shower =body lotion and since i have a very dry skin even if i live in a tropic country i thought i might give this a try. i see no result when i tried following the instructions but when i tried it when just after i pat dry my skin for some reason my skin absorbed moisture better. it left my skin smooth and soft. i wish they have a more concentrated formula so i could use it even in the shower. also am not a fan of the scent. smells cheap. other than that ill finish this bottle and not repurchase.,2
3.0,Thought I was ordering the cream foundation I had before. This if ok as a powder for touch ups! But I need my cream for better coverage,2
3,OK. For me seems to be too light. I have to wait for results.,2
3.0,They leak out too much oil sometimes.,2
3,It is Ok blade. It will give me decent shave.<br />Not impressed though. Persona or Astra works much for me better.,2
3,I bought this but the price was on it for 7 dollars. If you have a sale on it let me know it's my favorite. An old school.,2
3,It's okay. I expected something stronger from watching the commercials. It's Not very strong. The Deodorant is much better though.,2
3,"The best part about this shampoo is that it's sulfate-free, which is why I bought it in the first place. It doesn't smell as good as my conditioner (a different brand - they didn't have any of the matching conditioner in-stock), but it doesn't smell bad, and it's pretty easy to get it through all your hair. I got it at WalMart for $4-something rather than here, so price-wise it's not bad either. My hair turns into a man-eating frizz dragon if I let it air-dry, and despite being naturally wavy refuses to hold a curl with any actual shape to it, but this does separate the waves into distinct pieces, something other shampoos fail to do. As for post-curling iron hold, it softens a bit within the first couple hours but stays pretty well after that.<br /><br />But onto the negative, and it's a big one for me - maybe it's just because I've never used sulfate-free before, but my hair feels DISGUSTING after I wash the conditioner out. My bangs and my roots look like I haven't washed my hair at all and the rest of my hair is dry, thick, and weighed down. If I leave it in, my hair gets crunchy, oily, and feels even heavier.<br /><br />Since it was only $4, I'll try the conditioner meant to go with it and see if that helps, but if not, it's onto the next sulfate-free I can find.",2
3,As the saying goes you get what you pay for. It was cheap and it works OK. Have purchased similar product costing more and now I see why.,2
3,Is not working as well as I expected,2
3,Stains clothes where ever they touch the sun block.,2
3.0,"It's not really as effective as advertised, but it does show some results",2
3,Not Bad. I thought it was just a gimac buts its kind of 50/50 its not for people who are trying to define their race just to define there curls. Its not a bad moisturizer. but as far as using it as a leave in you have to spritz the hair lightly with water just so that way it is damp and then work this product all throughout your hair that is sectioned and thoroughly detangled. it's meant for two strand twist or sometimes two strand twist to the scalp. you leave it in for a day or so and let it air dry and then take it down and your hair should be defined either by having nice loose curls or big beach waves.,2
3,"I really like the actual makeup. The powder looks fantastic: it evens skin tones, it's shine free, and it doesn't irritate my skin.<br /><br />The container/brush is a big problem, which is why I'm giving this only three stars.<br /><br />The container and the brush are the same thing. The intention of the design is for the loose powder to never have a brush dip into it; instead, it's supposed to fall through a hole in the base of the brush and come out through the brush for application. It doesn't work. After removing the sticker covering the powder, I screwed the brush back on and, as directed, I \\""invert[ed] jar and gently tap[ped] to allow powder to begin flowing through brush.\\"" Then I shook it, spun it, anything I could do to try to get the powder to come through. A little bit of would come through, but not close to enough to actually apply. I checked everything, even pushed a paper clip through the hole to make sure nothing was blocking it. The powder builds up before the hole, but doesn't seem to make it through very well. I think the hole is too narrow and the brush too thick for it to work. It's an awful design.<br /><br />Instead, I just unscrew the brush and dip it in the powder, the way I would for any loose powder. That works well enough, although the container is very narrow for a brush. I wish I had another container to pour it into.<br /><br />Since I like the makeup but not the container, then next time I might try [[ASIN:B002YGFA08 Physicians Formula Mineral Wear Loose Talc-Free Powder .49 oz (14 g)]] in Translucent Light, and hope that it's basically the same makeup. It's by the same company, has good reviews, and doesn't have this ridiculous through-the-brush application process.",2
3,"I'm not sure about this brush. It's not much but plastic bristles. My child however, complains less when I use it but still not justified with the price.",2
3,Nozzles don't fit great.  Kind of hard to snap on and off.  Water leaks from the fittings so you have to hold it over the sink the entire time you are using it.  Hoping that as it is used more it may work a little smoother.,2
3,"Bought this from wholefoods and It is really greasy, does not dry quickly, stains things and burns like hell. However, I do have sensitive skin, I am very deficient and I used liberally. I recommend applying 30min before you shower and forewarning, it also burns at first when you rinse it off xD. So at this point your probably asking yourself...why would I want to submit myself to such torture? Firstly, well its a good product if you have trouble absorbing nutrients or have digestive issues as taking it internally is likely to result in an imbalance between calcium and magnesium since ratio has to be perfect for benefits and if you take too much internally you also get the laxative effect. You can still get laxative effective if you are ALSO taking it orally. Trans-dermally will only absorb as much as the body needs. 2ndly nearly all the oil/gel product reviews report the same burning stinging, intensity varies on individual and possibly how deficient you are. (don't use on areas that are already irritated) Lastly it did seem to give a strange numbing sensation after it full dried and absorbed on my arms on my test run, along with more energy and instant relief to muscle knots.",2
3,"Been using disposable razors for the last 15 years. 20 years before that I was using Remington electric foil shavers.<br /><br /> I have a sensitive beard,  and I couldn't shave everyday with  the disposable razors.  So, I decided to try this Norelco rotary (PT730).  Gave it a thorough college try, and it was great to be able to shave every day again, but I started to realize that the Norelco was not shaving as close as blades.<br /><br />Seemed to recall the foil shavers doing better, so I found this Remington MSC-140:  [[ASIN:B0009OAFVG B0009OAFVG]]  Very inexpensive and shaves much closer.  I only wish it was rechargeable instead of using AA batteries.  Removing and recharging NiMH AAs, every few days or every week is somewhat of a hassle.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I missed my Amazon return deadline by one day.  Norelco has a 45-day, money-back guarantee trial period, but it seems like a hassle to jump through all of their hoops.<br /><br />At any rate, this rotary is quieter than the foil razors.",2
3,"Need to wear the glove every time using this.<br />A little bit hard to control,<br />it is difficult to keep the hair around the wand and don't know which direction should start.",2
3.0,"Decent cleansing conditioner.  Smells more chemical than rosy to me, and I still like Herbal Essences Naked a lot better.",2
3,"When I sampled this scent I was attracted to the smokey wood tones, and it has been a nice addition to my collection.  I've never gone for the all-too-common citrus scents, and I was glad to find this alternative.  But after wearing it a few times my verdict is that the smokey/black pepper aroma is just a little too dominant and could have been softened a bit, maybe with a trace of jasmine or even light sandalwood.  The pepper overtone reminds me a lot of Dolce & Gabanna's Pour Homme.  Tommy Bahama might have come close to being one of my favorites, but while I like the masculine tone I feel little too much like I've just walked out of a barbeque place if I apply more than a trace, hence the three stars. But because I enjoy having a variety of masculine scents to choose from, I am glad to have this around even though it is not at the top of my list alongside favorites like the discontinued Abercrombie & Fitch Woods (for casual wear) or Roger & Gallet's L'Homme (for dress up).  (I found that softening the Tommy Bahama with a trace of Woods yields an almost ideal fragrance for me.)",2
3,Gone thru 3 pair.  They do well at first.  Blades wear out fast and start to cut you.  Not durable. First 2 broke.  Third started to cut my head after about 30 uses.  To keep head shaved you use these 2-3 times per week.  Rep blades are 25 bucks.  Going with Andis or Oster this time.  It's possible 000000 blade is just too close for my shape of head.  Gonna stick with 000 trimmers for awhile.,2
3.0,"I used these to apply setting powder to my face after I put on my foundation. I just dab it on, all over my face, I don't wipe or smear it on. But even with dabbing, I found that a lot of my makeup came off onto the powder puffs. I guess this may not necessarily be the puffs' fault... but I ended up going back to using a brush to apply my powder. I guess I'm just not a puffs girl. I also didn't like how these didn't have a little strap or handle on the back. It was kinda weird holding it by the edge. Also, I tried washing one...it didn't work too well. The softness went away and I couldn't use it again.",2
3,"The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because of &#34;misleading&#34; advertising. They're trying to show themselves as an &#34;organic&#34;/&#34;natural&#34; compound by listing only the inactive ingredients.<br />The active ingredients are Zinc Oxide (14.5 %), Titanium Dioxide (2.0 %). So bad on that!<br /><br />It's exactly the same ingredients as man other cheaper sunscreens, like Coppertone Baby (NICE AND EASY - this part is important, the regular baby one has carcinogenic ingredients).<br /><br />Basically after spending a week looking through ingredients and doing research I've found there is VERY LITTLE difference between different brands, it's ALL about the ingredients and brand go OUT of their way to CONFUSE people. E.g. Coppertone water babies is carcinogenic, where as coppertone babies nice and easy is EXACTLY the same active ingredients as this one.<br /><br />So just look at this website http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/report/the-trouble-with-sunscreen-chemicals/<br />It' lists out ALL the safe and carcinogenic ingredients in sunscreens. The just go and check the ingredients on the bottle at your local store or online. Look at the active ingredients and as long as they are maked safe by EWG go and buy it. Don't waste money these fancy brands. There is no added value.<br />I paid less than seven bucks for this and now I see within a week they're charging almost 10. You can buy coppertone babies nice and easy (don't forget the nice and easy part) for half the price.",2
3,was a good purchase.,2
3,One bottle arrived broken. Maybe that's why you get three?<br /><br />Others work fine.,2
3,"I used this after coloring my hard a deep red/brown. I liked the color, but wanted to go back to my original. I used this in hopes of removing the dye. It did, but left my hair brassy and unnatural looking. As the label warns, your resulting color is whatever is left of your original color after the dye strips it. My hair was slightly damaged after using it, but should be alright after a bit of deep conditioning. The semi-permanent dye I purchased to color my hair with after using this product stuck as well as Color Oops said it would, and the color is definitely darker than the box. Overall, it did it's job but I am knocking one star off for the TERRIBLE sewage-like smell that it gives off and leaves both in your hair and in the space in which you used it, and I am knocking off another because they claim to bring you back to your \\""natural\\"" color, but only mention INSIDE the box that you may never get your natural color back as the dye used may have ruined it. It's a bit misleading.",2
3,works well,2
3,Did not realize it was only battery operated.  Would have preferred that it was rechargeable. It is very powerful though and easy to fill.,2
3,"Lightweight and seems to be safe for color-treated hair, as claimed, but this seems more like a styling gel rather than a leave-in conditioner. Leaves my hair curly, as it should be, but seems to dry it out more than anything else.",2
3,"the rollers are not large enough for my long hair. it makes it difficult to curl it all. outside of that, the product is okay.",2
3,"After reading previous reviews, I doubted this product would work well. But, for the price, I thought I would take a chance. First, all the complaints about setting it up are misplaced. I had no problem at all. If you are able to read the instructions, and us a bit of common sense, installing the shaving cream/gel cans is very easy. The lather warms up to a nice temperature. I have been using it now for about a month and look forward to my daily shave.  Great product. Thank goodness for Amazon, I couldn't find this at any of our local stores. And the price was great.<br /><br />I am downgrading my initial review one star. About 6 months into use, black specks started to appear in the shave cream after heating the unit up. Several times I have disassembled the unit and gave it a thorough cleaning. Each time after about 3 to 5 uses the speck start to reappear. Have some hesitation using it anymore.",2
3,It keeps my skin around eyes smooth but not for lifting. I like it drys fast before putting make-up on.<br />I may not buy it next time for a lifting product.,2
3,Great idea but it shaves my husband's face to close.  Think about it. If you run the razor down the skin once you are actually shaving it 4 times each time.  This in time would irritate the skin.  Need a great shave cream to keep the skin smooth during the shave.,2
3,Doesn't cut as well as the original that came with the razor.  Maybe it needs a break-in period and will do better as time goes on.  Adequate for the reasonable price.,2
3,"Works well for arm pits and upper arm, horrible for legs and arms. Haven't used on bikini area.",2
3,I usually buy Anastasia eyebrow gel but it is just so dang expensive. So I was looking for a cheaper version. This seems to work ok. I have noticed sometimes I apply it more than once a day. So I guess it is not sticking as much.,2
3,"It smells good in the bottle, but on my skin smells HORRIBLE lol I really don't know how that happened, since I have never had a perfume smell like that on my skin. Majority of the time, perfumes smell good on my skin, but this did NOT agree with my body chemistry lol So sad too because the scent of this is a mature vanilla. A little sophisticated and going out type of spray. Weird. Hmm. Probably going to try the real one on the bath and body works website or in store, to see if I have better luck with it, since I KNOW it will be new, vs this for who knows how long was just sitting around or diluted etc., Js.",2
3,I have used this product for over a year and when I ordered this I thought I would get the same product.  When I received this product it had a funky smell and a funny texture.,2
3,"They don't make dry shampoo like they used to. Nothing special, but not horrible. Like most of the other stuff out there. The only really good stuff is made by Toni and Guy, but it's super expensive.",2
3,I'm still using the brow accelerator every night and I think it has made them a tad bit fuller. I'm not really sure though. I feel like I need to use it for a longer period of time before I see more obvious results. Worth a try.,2
3,"Feel great, but need sharpening already.",2
3,"I've been using this soap now for a couple weeks.  It does not dry out my skin, and it does smell really nice, though the smell isn't quite as strong as some reviewers led me to believe.  I was looking for a really powerful fragrance of rose or lavender and I would say it has a medium level of fragrance.  I've used Young Living soaps in the past and I think the fragrance they impart is nicer, though some types of their soaps are a little too heavy on certain essential oils and over time it can make my skin sensitive.  The Doux bar does seem like it's going to last at least another few weeks.  I'm guestimating, but I'm thinking it will last around 2 months.  Not bad for a bar of soap.  I use it with a poof and it gets nice and sudsy and it's very pleasant and easy to soap up your whole body and build yourself into a fragrant suds monster before rinsing yourself back to being merely human.  I am always looking for a soap that won't necessitate putting on moisturizers.  Alas, this is not it.  I still have to moisturize, but it definitely does not dry like commercial soaps and I would likely buy it again.",2
3,"I liked this product, but even with glitter primer it fell all over the place",2
3.0,"Bought this product hoping for good coverage for my kids and myself.  It works as a block for a little bit.  If you plan on using it around water or for long bouts of time in the sun, I wouldn't trust it.  I still got sunburned with it on.  The only time it worked on my kids is when they were playing indoor/outdoor, which means they probably would have been just as well off without the sunscreen.",2
3.0,Arrived much sooner than expected.  Female partner uses this on her sore back and it works well for pain relief and general relaxation.,2

It's still a good price for a nice frame, it would work perfect for a beginner but would't hold up for a quality tattoo.",2
3,"Unfortunately, after a couple of months of using this product, I didn't see much improvement in preventing calluses.  It does have a slight &#34;sour&#34; smell, but it's not too bad. The cream is rich but not too greasy.  I just wished it worked better on preventing the built up of calluses.",2
3,"I was expecting a metallic finish or look, this mask did not have that., (I was disappointed). other than that the quality was good for the price,.  I ordered several mask to have a few 2 chose from.

3,"Not a bad product..not great either. all the colors (at least on me), seem to be the same, and the color doesn't last all that long. Yes, they are moist, and yes, they all are pink. I have found that putting a white lipstick type concealer under the product, seems to help with the lasting effects. You can use this trick for any lipstick. By varying the amount of white you use, you will also effect the finished color. If you really want a lasting color--this is not the product.",2
3,"Good, but not great. Too expensive.",2
3,Smaller container than a shoe polish tin! It says your getting 2ozs(over looked that when ordered) but then you hold the can up to a can of Polish (1 1/8 oz) let's say this the rocket tin will fit inside the Polish tin with ease. Smells ok I guess. Does it work:/ for the price sorry new American company na! Not worth it. It is very greasy but being a man I'm not sure if it supposed to be like that. I find myself putting it on at night for a hour then wiping it off before I walk on my floors. Same price less of a greased pig feel and like a 5 or 6 oz tin. Then it would be Worth it,2
3,"You can see details, but it's a real strain on the eyes to see them because you have to shape your cornea in special shapes to adapt to the mirror's. It's useful and I'll use it because I'm too cheap to get another product (expected lifetime usage is 10 hours)",2
3,"I wore solar and gel nails for a long time and am trying to get my nails healthy again. When I saw this file, I wanted to try it because splitting, peeling and cracking are a problem for me. I find the file uncomfortable to hold and difficult to use. Sometimes I just give up and go back to my old file. However, I am going to persist and if I find I can give a better rating, I will come back and do so.<br /><br />One positive is that is easier to use at the side of the nails, and perhaps that is what I will use the glass file for.<br /><br />Recently I did the research I should have before the purchase. What I found is that the reason the glass file is supposed to be better is because it has a higher grit level and you can get the same thing with a regular file that has a higher grit level.

I follow the directions about holding it for 10 seconds and moving it out a little and doing it again.  It only offers the slightest curl, really it's barely noticeable.  I have no idea why it's gotten rave reviews from some people.  I hoped it would be worth the money, but it isn't.",2
3,"I have very fair skin with cool undertones (light pink), and this kit didn't work for me.  The makeup itself is great, but since I didn't keep half of the products, it wasn't a cost-efficient purchase for me. <br /> <br />Foundation - The \\""fairly light\\"" and \\""light\\"" foundations in this kit were both too dark and too warm (yellow/orange undertones) for me, but I love the way the foundation wears.  It is super-lightweight, very natural-looking and feeling, easy to blend, and easy to control how much coverage I want.  I gave them to my sister and friend, who love them, and I bought [[ASIN:B00021DVCQ Bare Escentuals i.d. bareMinerals SPF 15 Foundation]] in \\""fair,\\"" which is light enough for my skin.  I wish it was a slightly cooler tone, but it is close enough.  I love the spf 15 (For better, waterproof sun-protection I love [[ASIN:B000Q9EK38 Colorescience Sunforgettable SPF 30 (0.23 oz)]] in \\""All Clear\\""). <br /> <br />Mineral Veil - I love this powder because it isn't colored.  I mix it with my other powders to lighten them.  Like the foundation, it is super-lightweight and natural-looking and feeling.  If it had spf, I would use it as foundation and use the foundation as concealer. <br /> <br />Warmth All-over Face Color - The powder is great, but this color absolutely did not work for me; it was way too dark and looked brownish-orange on my skin, but it looks great on the friend I gave it to.  I later purchased [[ASIN:B00021DV4O Bare Escentuals i.d. bareMinerals All-Over Face Color]] in \\""Glee,\\"" which I use more as a blush than an all-over face color.  (I've always been hesitant to use blushes because I am naturally pink and don't want to be over-pink, but \\""Glee\\"" looks very natural on me.)  I also use it as lip-color under a layer of gloss. <br /> <br />Skin Rev-er Upper - I wouldn't have purchased this alone, so I'm glad it came in the kit because I love it.  It is cool, light, refreshing, feels great, and smooths the skin prior to makeup application. <br /> <br />Flawless Application Brush - Wonderfully soft brush that I use for foundation, blush, and mineral veil. <br /> <br />Full-Coverage Kabuki Brush - I gave it to my sister (along with one of the foundations that didn't work); it seemed like a great little brush. <br /> <br />Maximum-Coverage Concealer Brush - This is a great little brush for applying a second layer of foundation to help cover dark under-eye color and other trouble spots. <br /> <br />DVD - I finally watched this a year or more after my purchase when I was sick and felt like lying on the sofa and doing nothing.  I didn't learn anything new, but it might be great if you've never worn makeup before. <br /> <br />This would be a great starter kit for someone whose skin isn't super-fair and has neutral to warm skintones.

Order came in the mail quick thanks to amazon prime 2day shipping.<br /><br />In the past, the soap worked wonders on skin tone when I was in middle school.  Then, as I was a darker caramel shade and after about a years worth of usage, my skin tone lightened up to the same color of my palms, which is a light olive.<br /><br />Another thing I remember about this soap is the odd numbing/tingling sensation I used to get when I lathered up with the soap. This batch doesn't seem to do that and am wondering if it contains less of the same whitening properties as it says it does.<br /><br />None the less, hopefully this soap does help to even out my skin tone on my back/tummy from a bad allergic rash I got a year ago. I've been using the soap for every shower since late October 2012 and so far I haven't noticed any change in color yet. I've finally used up one bar out of eight.  I just opened up a new box to begin using today (late February 2013).<br /><br />As for side effects, my skin is already quite dry and I've made it a habit to lather on tons of lotion anyway to combat this. So I haven't really noticed the extra drying effect it may have from what others have mentioned.<br /><br />Feels clean and refreshing after a wash.  I recommend really lathering up the feet and armpits with this soap to get all the grime and dead skin cells off for a squeaky clean feeling.<br /><br />I will probably update this review again in another 3-6 months to verify it is working.

I was going to use it on my hair-dog, but if I don't like it, then I can't do that to his sensitive skin.  I'm sure it will be fine for some, especially at this price, which is a steal.",2
3,"It serves the purpose, but a bit bulky.  Must use double sided tape or it will move around.",2
3,"I used this product for 10 days (packets, not jar) and saw little difference.  Wasn't using it to clear up acne as some reviewers, so I can't speak to that, but was just eager for something to brighten and renew my middle-40s skin.  It's easy to apply and feels nicely astringent, so it seems like it SHOULD be doing something.  But at the end of 10 days I honestly don't see any major difference in age or sun spots, pore size, wrinkles or anything else.  Right after you use it, your skins looks brighter and taught, but that's true of almost any product, including basic moisturizer.  So, can't say I'd recommend, though to be fair, maybe its helping something under the surface, or long term, that isn't apparent day to day.",2
3,"I am disappointed. The price was wonderful. The item took 4 days longer than expected. The product was delivered in a plastic container as shown, however half of it was cracked and shards of sharp plastic is embedded in the shea butter. I used it for body butter and it mixed well with coconut oil and almond oil. The product itself is good quality but the packaging really disappointed me.",2
3,I was a little bummed that there were two or three of the same color and they didn't all have the same amount in them. Other than that it was good.,2
3,Slow delivery. Product works ok.  May be used. Not sure.  Ive had better.,2
3,"Bristles are stiff and don't hold soap that well, though they do a pretty good job trapping body hair,",2
3,"I've uploaded a photo to show my pre-lightened hair color vs. the test strips at 1 hour and 1.5 hours. The product smells very strong. Use in a highly ventilated location. If you have long hair you will need 2 bottles. It mixes very easily and the powder does not get in the air if you're careful.<br /><br />The creme is very thick and stays put. You'll definitely need a helper to get the back and the roots since it doesn't shift much at all once it's on your hair. There's no more burning sensation than I get with any other permanent color.<br /><br />The test strips came out very shiny and smooth (but not mushy at all). I pulled the hairs and there's slightly less elasticity than my normal hair but it's still very healthy and *so* shiny! I started with dyed, very very dark brown hair (nearly black) and had pink highlight on top of that. Ive never bleached my hair before. I find the red-orange color to be quite beautiful in sunlight! It reminds me of a nice, natural red hair color.",2
3,"I have had Norelco shavers for over 40 years and have never had a problem. Shaving with this one is just like the others, it does a great job. The only problem I have with this is cleaning it. Once the screens come out I have a very hard time putting them back in. Yesterday it took me about 5 minutes to get them in correctly.",2
3,ok,2
3,"Good product,but no instructions or recipt and no suggestive sales.You could make more money that way.",2
3,"Why do these product always have to be designed with such strong scents?!  Although it works fine on my long straight hair (leaving it glossy and still touchable) I could not handle leaving it in.  I had to take another shower later in the day after using this for the first time in order to remove the scent.  Since one’s hair is close to one’s nose, the smell persists.<br /><br />You can get by with using a lot less than the recommended walnut size.  If you have to use that much at a time it will get very pricey quickly.",2
3.0,I decided to try this lip balm based on reviews. Paying more than 30 USD for a lip balm is not something I would do on a regular basis but seeing the reviews made me give it a try. So far the results are like for any other lip balm so I doubt I will reorder.,2
3.0,Ok,2
3,"The quality was good and my wife was happy, however she did state that if she were to wear these again, she would ave to buy another pack simply because it does not seem to be enough. She did like the product and was happy, and looked absolutely beautiful with them during our wedding!",2
3,I gave the product a 3 because even for sensitive skin it is still rough..It does a great job exfoliating but you really have to be extra gentle and even then it still feels you are not being gentle enough..,2
3,I like to buy this product with the little thing to chanche just in case I need it. Really great,2
3,"It doesn't keep hair smoother or shinier any more than a regular curling iron.  It heats up quickly. My hair doesn't glide through very well, and often gets caught in the iron.",2
3,"I have heard so many people say great things about this mascara so I was expecting great things out of this product. So when I found this trial size version at a decent price I decided to try it that way if I did like it I would go on to invest in the full size. However, it just didn't amaze me. I mean it's not the worst mascara ever but to me not the greatest either. I'm not sure if maybe I didn't get a bad one and so I didn't get to experience the best formula of this product, but whatever I received was just ok for me. I used it a few times then moved on to a different mascara. Hopefully it will work out better for some than it did for me.",2
3,They seem to be old. They easily shreds.,2

3,"It's a toothbrush!  Although I tried selecting my Power Ball numbers with the handle of this toothbrush, it has yet to select the numbers that will win the PowerBall jackpot - therefore I'm downgrading it from a 5 to a 3.",2
3,It's really greasy and does not like to absorb very quickly.  Bought this because my Dermatologist thought it would help my dermatitis.,2
3,"Performance is acceptable for regular conditioing when I don't have something for deeper strengthening and moisturizing. However,  I am more impressed with the conditioner than the accompanying shampoo.",2
3,Probably a good product but too greasy for my oily skin.,2
3,The quality of the cream feels consistent. The content amount and packaging is deceptive. I ordered this again because the amount and quality justified the cost. It is disappointing that deception was considered necessary. A false bottom in the box and the jar stops tis from being a 5. Disappointed.,2
3,"I bought the unscented paraffin, and it is effective and soothing when melted in a paraffin bath.  However, I found these blocks very hard to break up so that they would melt more easily. The paraffin beads that came with my unit break apart and melt much more easily. The shipping charges for six one-pound blocks was somewhat high.  I am going to try to find the unscented paraffin beads at a local beauty supply in order to avoid the high shipping charges.",2
3.0,smells ok,2
3,"At first I was in agreement with the other people who left reviews, in fact I came on here to get some tips on application because it wasn't working for me either. Then I wet the hair first. Ta da!!! It works! My daughter has brown hair and we just did the pink. I did a 1 inch section and then let it dry for for about 10 minutes and then used a wide tooth comb to kind of de-tangle it. It worked! Good Luck! The directions definitely SUCK!",2
3,"The color requires a lot of coats to look good, but the polish lasts a long time.",2
3,"I really wish I could give this an enthusiastic review, because that would mean that it actually worked for me. I have terrible facial acne and have tried absolutely everything under the sun to treat it for the past six years (Proactiv, Acne Free, other salicylic or benzoyl peroxide producs, Retin-A, antibiotics, taking Zinc tablets, drinking apple cider vinegar, applying tea tree oil, sulfur masks, homemade honey and lemon juice masks)...everything works at first, but soon becomes ineffective.    I figured that since everything I've tried is pretty much equally ineffective, I'd just stick to a natural routine. So now my routine is the following: morning: Dudu-osun soap to wash the face, mask of raw or clover honey and fresh lemon juice for 30 minutes, tea tree oil. Night: Dudu-osun, tea tree oil, and sulphur clay mask before bed. Anyone else's skin would be glowing!! Mine is still totally broken out.    But the soap smells nice and lathers well, considering it's natural and has no sulfates. The soap has not made my skin worse, from what I can tell. It just won't cure my acne or lighten my acne scars, which is what other reviewers rave about. Maybe those reviews are fake?    Anyway, three stars for a nice natural soap...no miracles here, though.",2
3,"This product might be good, but for others, not for me. It irritates my skin and I am not very convinced of its effectiveness. I haven't used it for a long time, only a couple times, for the reasons mentioned before. I am disappointed of this product.",2
3,"I used this product and while it works fantastic, my body does not like baking soda...at all :(<br /><br />2 months after stopping use I still have a red patch under my arm and my armpits are slightly discolored.  There is no burning sensation anymore but it's not fully healed.  While using the product it still smelled fresh or completely odorless after 24 hours so it really does work but if you're sensitive to baking soda then I advise you to stay away.<br /><br />I've since switched to their &#34;happy pits&#34; product - http://goo.gl/Myo5mX - and it works pretty good but only for about 8-10 hours on average and can be hard to apply in cold weather.",2
3.0,The colors shown in picture are not really the color of the actual polish.  The polish doesn't stay on as long as other gels.  But still a good deal for the price which averaged to about 3.00 per bottle.  Also the bottle's are all black with no spot that shows the color of the polish.  As gels have to be cured under an LED light to dry you would have to paint a bit of the color on your polish bottle and put the bottle under the LED light to dry.,2
3,I was expecting a neutral color but I received a bottle of what I would describe as yellow nail polish.  It might be just what someone else is looking for.,2
3,"I bought this concealer hoping it would reduce the darkness and puffiness under my eyes. I think there is a subtle difference as far as the puffiness is concerned, but the dark circles needs a lot more than a few dots to blend. I would recommend it cause Olay is a good brand.",2

3,I am a young girl with natural hair i added this brush to the cart to go with the new blow dryer i was getting and while it worked it was pretty okay... not much to expect from a brush however within 2 weeks of having it it broke in half. I just think it's poorly designed and maybe should use something stronger to hold it together.,2
3,"I got these as a free sample in an ULTA purchase I made. Each swipe is individually packaged which is not very eco-friendly, but very convenient for travel!<br /><br />For reviewing purposes, when I do my nails, I use an OPI Base Coat, two coats of a colored OPI Polish and an OPI Top Coat. Each wipe is able to do a full ten fingernails, but it does take some effort. I think traditional nail polish mover is 1/10th the time. The difference? This doesn't smell like you're losing brain cells; in fact, its lavender scented. Also, its not as hard on my nails and it does not dry them out.<br /><br />I am not completely sold, however. I don't use nail polish remover very often, about once a month. Because of that, I think it is still worth it money-wise (cause this is expensive compared to normal nail polish remover).",2
3,"nice for trimming hair from ears and nose, Not much use for facial hair.  Much better price than on TV ad.",2
3,Stain comes out of the holder which makes using it rather difficult. It pulls out when pulling the cap off. Nice color though.,2
3,"Disappointing.  Doesn't seem to really make any difference in the appearance or feel of the skin.  Haven't been using it for a long time, maybe three weeks, but some creams make an immediate difference and these drops do not have that effect. Don't waste your money is my early gut feeling.<br />Giving it three stars since I have not been using it a long time.",2
3,This trimmer does an ok job with nose hairs. Price was good and battery life is ok. Just wish it was a little more precise!,2

3,I like the scent although initially the scent was off. My complaint: bad longevity and projection. But very mood lifting grape fruit scent.,2
3,Lots of hair only issue is it eventually loses its curl and gets tangled but otherwise it's decent,2
3,"I brought this from my local beauty supply store back in Jan. so I've had it three months. It was $35 at the store so it was cheaper than on Amazon.  I use this every other week (I'm trying to cut back on my heat use so that's why every other). I use it for 30 minutes when I deep condition my hair for moisture and 1 1/2 for a protein. Then I rinse the conditioner out, use a leave-in, a foaming mouse and wrap it. Once it's wrapped, I go back under the dryer for 1 1/2 - 2 hours. Yes, that's a long time under the dryer so here's what I have noticed. (I have ear length, permed African-American hair.)  Pros: -It gets very hot, very quick! Within the first 30 minutes, the crown of my hair is dry. -It helps the oils and conditioners I use coat and condition my hair. And that helps reduce breakage. -The heat helps my hair to lay down. Before when I wrapped my hair, I would find areas of my hair sticking up randomly throughout the day. This dryer lays my hair down and it stays like that for a week or so. -I get salon quality hair in the comfort of my home. Sometimes I cannot afford to or have the time to go to the salon so this dryer does the trick.  Cons: -You know how I said the dryer gets very hot, very quick? Well, it's only in the middle of your head! The back and sides of my hair are still wet longer so I find myself rotating my body and hair towards the hotter parts of the dryer. -It is extremely loud, like really, really loud. I cannot hear my television even when the sound is turned all the way up. -The dryer has collapsed in my face. -Where it rest on the base is not strong enough. I often tilt or angle the dryer in order to stop it from falling over.  I would buy a dryer again, just not this particular one. I love the results of using heat to deep condition my hair. The loud noise and the dryer falling on me is downer.",2

Maybe it's the hot climate or my watery eyes, but just thought I'd post.<br /><br />I do like it, but will probably experiment with a different product next time.",2
3,"I bought one for me and one for my mom for her birthday. She opens it, takes the plastic off& 2 of the brushes came off of the handles. Later mine did the same. Positive side, soft, the bristles don't come out easily like others and the case is very convenient.",2
3,"This product was good, it didn't streak and provided an instant color. It doesn't last very long and you have to reapply almost everyday but for the price it's a good value",2
3,"Nice consistency but haven't seen a difference in dark circles or lines. The pump container is not the best delivery device, it allows too much product to be wasted. Although the product is acceptable for softening eye area and the gel is my preferred eye product, beware, the seller, Eve Hansen Beauty, will bombard you with emails about rating them and their product. For this reason I will NOT purchase this again. Three stars - I like the product even though I haven't seen a difference in dark circles but I detest all the pushy emails.",2
3,"I purchase this for one use only: to shave my private parts. That's its intended use.<br />I keep myself shaved there, so the hair length wasn't a problem. The unit is easy to manipulate and quiet, but it doesn't have much power. I guess not much is need if your hair is already short. This works in tandem with the companion product which shaves hair to about a quarter of an inch. I haven't tried that, but it's the way they are marketed.<br />I previously used a regular blade razor, but couldn't get into all the crevices and occasionally made a small nick and bled a little.<br />That won't happen with this, but I recently switched to using a 3-head electric for my face, and one day just plunged ahead and used it on my privates. It worked well, again, since my hair was already short there. The 3 heads rolled and pivoted over all the crevices and it actually worked better than the Cleancut, so I now use that and this has become extraneous. I did have to use some caution with my regular electric, especially in ensuring the hair is short. I once used it on my underarms when the hair was over half an inch long and it did cause some razor burns. The Cleancut, though, won't even work if the hair is too long, so the danger is reduced, but so is the convenience.<br />I tried the powder method and then I tried a pre-electric, alcohol-based product. I didn't like the powder, but the pre-electric is fine if you don't have any irritation there, maybe a slight burning sensation at first, but lasting only a few seconds.",2

3,"I ordered this product on August 23, 2013. It was shipped on August 24 (1 day after), yet the tracking did not show up until August 28th (5 days after) in China. On September 4th (12 days after ordering), I received the package (MO, USA).<br /><br />I opened the bubble envelope to find that the lint wipes had been placed in a plastic package. There were 4 stacks of lint wipes. I counted the first stack. There were 70 wipes. I thought, \\""Maybe the missing 30 wipes are in a separate stack.\\"" I counted the second stack. 70 wipes. I counted the third stack. 70 wipes. I counted the fourth stack. You guessed it-- 70 wipes. The seller cheated me out of 120 wipes!! If one stack had contained 95 wipes and another had 105 wipes, etc., I would have just attributed the miscount to human error. But when each stack has exactly 70 wipes? That's fishy.<br /><br />I would NOT recommend this seller or this product. They're dishonest, and I have already contacted them regarding this issue by filing a claim through Amazon. I will update this review when or if they resolve this issue.<br /><br />Update: I received a message from Etopsell the same day I sent in the claim. It read, \\""Dear friend, Thank you for you contacting us, sorry to make you met the situation, as the item was supplied by the supplier, we will resend you the miss one? Please be patient to wait for it. Nice day.\\"" I will update this review again if I receive the missing lint wipes.<br /><br />Update 9/9/13: I sent them an email yesterday because I still hadn't heard from them about a tracking number for the replacement. I let them know that I'd be filing an Amazon A-Z Guarantee claim if I didn't receive the tracking number within a few days. It had already been five days since they said they would send me a replacement, and when I had ordered this item originally, they had sent out the item the next day and given me a tracking number promptly. Therefore, I felt like they either forgot to notify me that they had sent it, orthey deliberately waited to see if I would forget about this dispute. Either way, they emailed me back the same day to give me the new tracking number. I will keep this post updated with any progress.<br /><br />Update 9/18/13: I received the shipment that they sent me (through China Post and USPS, not DHL, FedEx, or UPS). I counted how many lint wipes they had sent to replace the missing 120, and within the two stacks I received, one had 73 wipes, and the other had 72. So they gave me 25 extra wipes. I am not sure if it's because they wanted to give me extra for the trouble or if they just wanted to get this issue resolved and threw two stacks into a bag. Either way, I'm content that I received what I paid for, even if it took WAY too long. I feel like the seller should have just sent me another 400 wipes as a way of customer service, but I understand that the seller would be going above and beyond if he/she did that. I think that something I liked about this company is that they were pretty fast to respond most of the time. I don't know if that's because I threatened with the A-Z Claim though, which I really would have filed if they had not messaged me back.<br /><br />So, originally 1/5 stars, I'll up them to 3/5 stars. But buy at your own risk! Don't buy from them if you need your wipes right away. Just go to a Sally's Beauty Supply or Walmart to avoid the possibility of a headache.",2

3,"I like this face wash, it's the best one I have found. I am a guy, and have sensitive skin. I've never really been in to washing my face, but mainly because I have never found a decent wash that didn't dry out my skin ASAP. I go to the beauty isle at my local grocery store and am overwhelmed. So a couple years ago, I came on amazon to see if I could find a face wash that was recommended. And I found this one. It feels great, doesn't dry my skin out.<br /><br />Now - for the bad part. The lid on this container gets easily clogged up. It's very annoying. It's just your standard pop-up lid, but it gets jammed up with dried out face wash. It gets to the point where you can't squeeze any out. If you try to squeeze too hard, it \\""pops\\"" the dried up seal and a bunch comes out. I usually end up unscrewing the lid and trying to get some out that way.<br /><br />Wish this company would fix the lid - would be a 5 star product!",2
3,"I have the model QC 5330, which according to the support person at Philips is almost identical to this cutter. I owned it for about two years before it broke.<br />PROS:<br />Much easier to use than my Wahl hair cutter. This is cordless, which is a big step forward, plus this is much lighter and more maneuverable.<br />Easy to change the length for your hair. It just takes a slight turn. No need to search for the right length adjuster (like I had to do with my Wahl).<br /><br />CONS:<br />Not very durable. The first one I bought from Amazon did not work when it arrived. Philips was fabulous and replaced it immediately. Great customer service at that time.<br />Not very durable! Yes, that needs to be said twice. After using it about 20 times the (cheap!) plastic blade guide broke. It broke while I was gently using it on my head. I'm not some teenager and was not abusing it. When I called Philips/Norelco to see about buying a replacement they said that the (cheap!) plastic attachment would cost $19. The new hair cutter is selling for almost that price on Amazon! Come on Philips. You know this is a problem, but rather than selling the replacement at a reasonable price ($10 or so) you decide to sell it for almost the same price as a new hair cutter? Very disappointing!<br /><br />The bottom line is that this hair cutter is a great idea. I LOVE the way it works. But I am not happy with its durability. My Wahl has been working for years and year and I have never had a problem with it. So now I am not sure what to do.",2

3,"The beard trimmer side (bottom of the device as pictured) is excellent and works very well. 5 stars. The shaver head is a single head shaver with &#34;edging&#34; trimmers on both sides. The trimmers are handy but buyer beware: the shaver is about as rough a shave as you can imagine. It is harsh on your face and would not likely satisfy you for a daily shave. Two stars for the shaver side. The battery lasts forever it seems, and the device is easy to clean. The charging stand is aesthetically pleasing on the counter top which is kind of a nice unexpected bonus. Overall: I had hoped for a shaver that did it all in one gadget. Due to the rough shave of a single cutter head, this one isn't it. That said, the beard trimmer does such a nice job it's worth ignoring the top side of the shaver if that's all you're after!",2

I enjoyed the creamy, thick texture of the conditioner, a little of this goes a long way.

3,"I have applied many times. Up to now, this product does not work on me. I'll keep trying until I finish this jar,  may be I'll find the right amount  in the future.",2
3,"I was not sure what to rate this? Does it work? Yes it does BUT... you have to keep going over and over clockwise/counter till it does the job. The more you rub over and over the more irritated your skin gets. It did not make my upper lip red but I would wonder how good it is for your skin  and how much damage you are doing to it by using this. When I look in the mirror the skin seems fine but it is irritated and does burn when I put lotion or even aloe vera gel. The strips are like very mild sandpaper. The instructions tell you not to go out into the sun for 24 hours after or to use any toner for a day afterwards as well. I did not put toner but Anything I put did burn. Also, I did not purchase this from amazon and my box looked different ( same product though).  ***Update*** I originally posted this a little over a year ago and everything I said still stands BUT...I WILL NOT USE THIS PRODUCT ANY LONGER because it caused a patch of skin above my lip to turn dark. When I realized it had done this I quit using the buffer but so far the skin is still dark which is worse than before because it makes it look as if you have dark hair above your lip even though there is none. I hope this is not permanent. :(",2
3,It works great if you use it over another polish. It doesn't crackle if you use it by it's self.  I liked they way it looked.,2
3,It's ok I can't figure it out if it's helping are not will buy it again and see if there is finally is a difference,2
3.0,"This wig is really nice, it arrived within a week and looks great on my I received a lot of compliments",2
3,"I orignally ordered the replacement heads, and found out that was just blades, so I had to order this to get my razor working agian.",2
3,"I have been hooked on Sonicare for over 10 years. I wouldn't brush with anything else. It has improved the health and appearance of my teeth and gums immensely. Not one cavity in over a decade! I would (and do) recommend it often and give Sonicare as gifts.  This is my 3rd or 4th model. I like that it's lighter and smaller and easier to clean.  The one problem I have with this unit is the postioning of the speed settings button. I find myself too often inadvertently changing it with my thumb while brushing, forcing me to turn the brush off and look at the settings button to return it to the desired setting.",2
3,"Arrived very late, but true to listing.",2
3,"I was hesitant to buy these brushes after reading tons of reviews but I caved and figured I would give them a try. The brushes are moderately dense and have a soft texture, but I feel they do not transfer my powders well. When it comes to blending liquids and creams, they work great.<br />I will continue to use these brushes until I find a new set more suitable to my needs.",2
3,"When this was in the store, I gave it a try, figuring I would like it because it has vanilla, which I love. However, all of the forms of it smelled like sunblock to me. Not what I was hoping for at all!",2
3.0,what you'd expect.,2
3,"For years I have used Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash for dry mouth recommended by my dentist.But recently, I decided I wanted to buy something that would really whiten my teeth so I ordered this toothpaste. It worked ok for a few days and then I started getting sore gums, sore tongue and canker sores on my gums and under my tongue and even at the back of my throat. I looked at the ingredients,which I should have before I even bought it, and it lists \\""sodium lauryl sulfate\\"". I quickly ordered my biotene and biotene mouthwash from Amazon and discarded this toothpaste.I have been washing my mouth out with salt water and using a small tube of biotene I luckily had left. I wish the major brands would stop using this additive. I now have to heal all the sores in my mouth. I rated this toothpaste a 3 because how difficult would it be to leave out this ingredient? There are thousands of complaints about this ingredient and still toothpaste makers include it in their product just to make their product foam more.",2
3,"Have been using the product for nearly 4 months now.  I am between norwood 2 and 3 stage and have hair like matthew mccounaghey in his ghost of girlfriends past movie. My main concern was my receding hairline and  my hair is thinning in the middle areas and the back (although very mild and not easily noticeable).  My receiding hairline is claarly noticeable.      Loved it in the beginning as it slowed down my hairloss and not as much as hair was falling into my hands in the shower or elsewhere.      After around 2 and a half months my scalp began feeling terribly itchy.  Sent Dave an email he reccomended a normal hairloss shampoo like Pantene.  I didn't want to stop using the product because I felt that it had reduced the amoutn of hairs I was losing.     Nearly 4 months now and inspite of the reduction in hairloss, my hair does look thinner especially on the hairline and in the crown aswell.   The frontal right area of my head has gone extremely thin and i do freak out when i look in the mirror.   IT could very well be that my hairs going through the shedding stage in the cycle at the moment and that coudl be the reason why it looks and feels so much thinner.   Still have another 2 months of supply left.     Am willing to give this product atleast 12 months.  In 12 months I should expect to be better of then I was when I started it.  If not then it definitely hasnt worked      Will post anohter update in October.",2
3,"I began considering age spot removal when sun spots (kinder phrase than \\""age spots\\"") were growing more visible on my upper cheeks as I enter my early 40's.  A little research and shopping time on Amazon, I chose Murad.  I started a twice-daily routine of Noxema and Murad.  After months, I was in the middle of my second bottle before noticing results.  They are slow but the spots have certainly faded.    Soon after acquiring my third bottle from Amazon, I ran across a Shiseido cream.  Though more expensive, results are seen in a couple weeks.  I still use Murad for spot areas on my skin, though Shiseido has won me over.    In summary, Murad's effectiveness depends on individual skin type.  I can say it did work on me, though much slower that I had anticipated or hoped.  I can say I've never experienced irritation of any sort.",2
3,"In my tablet, it looks like little bit bright black - Deep charcoal.<br />But It is kind of wine. I don't like red-wine-vamp thing.<br />And China Glaze nail brush is so narrow. Also I don't like narrow thing.<br />I'm very disappointed",2
3,"I thought that this product would make my hair really soft, but after the first, then second, then third time I used it, it didn't really make a significant difference in the texture of my hair. It's not something I'm recommending, because for the price, I expected better.<br /><br />I have straight black hair, slightly damaged (slightly coarse, some split-ends), mid-length, and despite the fact that my hair is not so damaged it didn't do much to enhance the shine or texture of it.<br /><br />One pro is that it smells good, but the smell does come off a bit strong, which might bother some people, but I like it.",2
3,"i am using Sonicare for several years. It seems to be a decline in quality. The toothbrush head is wearing out in less than a month. Although, supposedly, it should last and be changed once in 3 months. Like I did before with my other Sonicare toothbrush. Disappointed, but already have it.",2
3.0,"I have only been using this for about a month now.  Seems just fine for shampoo but I have yet to notice any difference in terms of hair loss or volume.  I'm assuming as with most products like this, you won't see results over night.",2
3,"I like the Light, however, their directions are ridiculous.  Nothing explaining how to or to put the bulbs in.  Nothing about how to remove the bottom for cleaning.  They need to re-vamp the directions entirely.",2
3,"For the price it is a very good buy. It would be a good gift for a young girl, probably between the ages of 8 and 12.",2
3,"Everyone loves this, I don't.  It doesn't cover the imperfections (like veins) on my lids like other primers do.  It doesn't make the color more vibrant and it doesn't last longer than it does with any other primer, even the really cheap ones that come in the eyeshadow trio",2
3.0,Rather flimsy in design but they stay in place well.,2
3.0,Makes my hair too heavy,2
3,"I have long since loved using Crest products, and this mouth wash did not disappoint. I like how the taste is not overly strong and it still leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean afterwards! I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.",2
3,"This item is no longer available in stores, so I was happy to find it here. Yet, it's just another hairspray - nothing too special.",2
3,I was really skeptical to try this. All of the needles look pretty scary. I have been using this for about a week and haven't seen any results yet. It is well made though. I will continue to use this in hopes that I see good results. I gave 3 stars just because I haven't seen results. The roller is good quality.,2
3,"The wig is much darker than pictured and came seemingly stuffed into the smallest bag I have seen a wig delivered in. This packaging promoted tangling, but once removed, the wig was manageable. The cap of the wig is unlike any other I have seen. It has much more material than all of my other wigs which would be a read flag for a wig of a lighter color. Overall, this isn't a bad wig, but the color really changes depending on the lighting of a room due to the blue that it is, so beware if you need a perfect color match.",2
3.0,I'm not sure if this unit was defective but the heating elements touched at the tip of the unit but closer to the base there was a gap. This gap allowed here to slip through without getting properly heated. I felt over time the gap lessened as the plastic handles began to slightly bend. When this unit did grab the hair it heated the hair well. The heating element also heated up very quickly. I don't feel I could give this product a proper review because I don't believe we're getting it to work properly.,2
3,"It's a good scrubby loofa thing once it gets sudsy, but it takes longer to suds up a bar of soap than I would like. If it got sudsy more quickly, I'd give it a higher rating.<br /><br />I'll probably buy the product again.",2
3,"I bought this because my nail polish always seems to chip and peel right away. This top-coat does a great job of making the polish super shiny which I like, but the polish still chops after just a day of wear so I don't feel like this improved endurance of the polish at all.",2
3,"Smells great, non greasy, but what's with the container?  I can hardly get the hand cream to come out of the hard plastic tube.",2
3,these razors leave cuts when you shave && the moisture starts peeling off after the first use i really don't like these razors.,2
3,"I purchased this curling iron because it has a brush. Although it works well, every time I use it I drop it! This is because the handle is so smooth, it slips. It has no grooves in it like the Conair models have. Be careful and hold tight!",2
3,"advertised as no Oder, NOT.  OK smell for fake tan",2
3,"I received one of these razors for review from Gillette. My first impression when opening the packaging was that it was easy to open, much easier than one of those plastic clamshells. However, half of the container is cardstock and the other half is plastic. I was confused if I was supposed to be able to recycle each of these separately. The second reaction that I had was that I was disappointed there was only one cartridge included. If I had purchased this myself, I would be upset to have to buy refills right away.<br /><br />I have used Gillette razors for many years. As with my previous experiences, the first use of a new razor is fantastic. It takes 1 swipe to do what I had been doing with 5 swipes with an old, dull razor. Unfortunately, After a week with the razor, I can tell that the performance is declining as was the case with my previous Gillette experiences.<br /><br />My chief complaint about this razor is that the shaved hair gets clogged between the blades and is hard to rinse out. I have previously had the same experience with Fusion Proglide razors without the Flexball handles. Unfortunately, this one is no different. This is the main reason why I switched back to the Mach 3 razor and have stuck with that for many years. The blades are just easier to rinse, since they are spread out more. It may be my imagination, but I think I get a longer life from the Mach 3 than from the Fusion blades, probably because I can keep them cleaner, causing less oxidation on the blades.<br /><br />I do like the extra blade on the back side of the razor. That is something you don't get with the Mach 3. It is handy for trimming sideburns, underneath the nose and the corners of the mouth.<br /><br />It is also nice that the cartridges are interchangeable with other Fusion handles. This could be handy if you are traveling or don't want to use the Flexball feature for some reason.<br /><br />That brings me to the Flexball feature itself. For all that it is promoted to be and the great marketing that Gillette has done, I'm not all that impressed with Flexball. It's ok, but I just don't notice that it does anything special for me that simply angling my wrist slightly wouldn't do. Sorry, I'm not in love with this razor. It's just ok. Make a Flexball that is compatible with Mach 3 cartridges and I might be a customer.the great marketing that Gillette has done, I'm not all that impressed with Flexball.

3,Haven't noticed a difference. I have already finished one bottle. I am going to try a different brand.  A natural. One from a vitamin store.,2
3,this did not do what it is supposed to do.,2
3.0,Okay.  Not a fan of the scent.  I like the small size though.  Easy to travel with.,2
3,Not rechargeable.,2
3,So the pros:<br />It seems like the product does work.  After only a few days I started to see a change around my eyes.<br /><br />The cons:<br />It suggests that you put it on at night and in the morning.  It leaves thick film on your face.  I tried putting it on thinner and thinner but it always felt like I had a gel mask on.  I gave up putting it on in the morning.  It was too annoying.  I eventually gave up putting it on at night too.  The feel of it was too gross for me.<br /><br />Also it did make me break out some.  I was kinda surprised because I almost never do.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Because I am a guy maybe I am not use to having stuff on my face all the time.  I really couldn't stand to do it anymore.  But if you are willing to put up with it I think it would work for you.  I instead started washing my face twice a day with cerave and have gotten some good results with it.,2
3,its okay.  took a month longer than estimated to get here.  but other than that it is true to the picture.,2
3,No problem with item,2
3,"I wound up giving this to someone else who likes a creamy moisturizer. I did not like the thick creamy consistency and it clogged my pores. If you like this sort of cream you might like it, I prefer a lighter more transparent moisturizer or a serum.",2
3,Not exactly what I expected but ok I guess. I have to take a bit longer to obtain the type shave desired.,2
3,The Clinical Peel and Resurfacer is the best product of the group. Other products are not special at this point.,2
3,It definitely covers up blemishes and freckles  but it's really really thick . I don't really wear foundation or face makeup just eyeliner and mascara and some shadow.  I work at 5am every morning so yeah I need an under eye concealer by the time 10am rolls around (my lunch break) it starts kinda looking Crusty and starts to settle in the fine lines under my eyes. I'm 32 and look pretty young for my age and never worried about wrinkles until I started using this and it started settling in my very fine wrinkles. I'm trying different ways of applying this hoping I'm just doing something wrong. I  dab it on and blend it with my ring finger. Maybe I'm supposed to cake alot of foundation on top of it??,2
3,"The high points of this kit are the only things that matter.   Machines-get them check by a professional.  Power supply-as long as you dont run it too high you shouldnt have a problem.  This & That-plenty of caps, grommets, rubber bands and other things.    Too many magnums, not too many people use them. i tossed mine when i opened my box of needles.  too many useless tips and such. disposable tubes should have grips.     other than that its a good buy at a good price. eventually these machines will be in a box forever as i move up the skill ladder but, as a beginner, i was told they are good to go for a while. just get them checked out.",2
3,Works well but there is no good way to clean the tank.,2
3,This is just fine. It is basically gold glitter in gel. I was looking for something more like a fine liquid gold. It stays on very well.,2
3,I liked it but it was not the one that I had purchased before.,2
3,GOt these for a trip at the suggestion of an article and they work as expected but leave an bad tasting film on your skin and will burn your eyes.  Do not recommend.  I have 2 of them left if anyone wants them!,2
3,The product advertised on TV covers better and also has a dispenser on the spray nozzle which allows spraying it on a small area.  I will not buy this again.,2
3,"I usually mix this butter w my favorite lotion because I don't like the Shea butter natural smell. Other brands dissolve pretty easy, this one leaves some sandy texture when mixed and my skin does not get well mosturized as when used other brand. I don'n think I'll order again",2
3,"This looks beautiful if applied correctly. However, it looks cakey after a few hours and I have sensitive skin...in a matter of weeks...my face was irritated. I just went back to tinted moisturizer.",2
3,"I am not sure if the cream is old or if that is the way it suppose to smell, expected a more fruity fragrance. Maybe I would have to buy it from the Body shop store to confirm the fragrance but for now I would pass on this body butter.",2
3,good stuff,2
3,This is a very handy mirror. We use it and have it hanging in our bathroom but unfourtanely this mirror does indeed fog up so I have to constanly wipe it down. this is ok with me but it doesnt quite do as the description described. :(,2
3,I love the variety of colors but the pigmentation and color pay off is somewhat lacking. I think I was expecting too much. :/ kind of disappointed.,2
3,"Don't really understand the hype, and the recommended color was waaaaay too light. I do enjoy the texture, but a wider color range would benefit this company greatly.",2
3,"First of all, let me start off by saying that I really wanted to like this sunscreen. I am extremely careful about my daily sun exposure, and was hoping that this would be the solution to my search for the perfect daily sunscreen. Due to the fact that I apply my SPF pretty liberally on a daily basis, I feel that it's a good idea to use a product that uses natural ingredients since your skin can absorb whatever you put on it into your blood stream. My skin tends to be normal-to-dry, so I thought this emollient sunscreen would be just right.<br /><br />So anyway, I was hoping that I would like this sunscreen for daily use. Unfortunately, I found that it made me too greasy and gave me that 'claustrophobic' sunscreen feeling when I started to sweat, which feels terrible. I gave it 3 stars because it might be okay for application on arms and legs or for a day at the beach, but it felt way too heavy on my face, neck, and d&eacute;colletage.<br /><br />I think the best option is to make your own natural face cream using [[ASIN:B0046HAIUK Do It Gorgeously: How to Make Less Toxic, Less Expensive, and More Beautiful Products]]and add [[ASIN:B003IGOL8U Zinc Oxide Powder - 1 lb. in Quality Heat Sealed Resealable Zip Lock Pouch]] to make your own natural sunscreen. That way you know exactly what is going into your skincare, and there is no worry about scary chemicals that you can't pronounce.",2
3,I don't think it really did much for my hair. Not that impressed with it.,2
3,Works ok but if I order any more I like the kind with the sunscreen in it.,2
3,"Great delivery, takes up to 4 months to work if it is going to. I am in my second month, nothing yet. Leaves roots a bit oily, but if it actually works, I can live with that.",2
3,Way too expensive for shampoo that does the same basic job as other products at a much lower price point.,2
3,"I started using WEN in January and decided I loved it.  I needed to re-order, and was not looking forward to the cost.  Based on another reviewer's response, I tried the Sally Beauty Supply version of this cleansing conditioner.  I love it!  It's much less expensive and I do think I like it better than WEN.",2
3,I don't find these so great. I think they could be cheaper for what you pay for them. That's all.,2
3,"I really want to like this product but it just isn't exactly what I was hoping for.  For one thing, it is a powder that you mix yourself.  I am sure it probably said that in the product description, but I missed it.  I am ok with that though.  My complaint is that no matter how much I mix, no matter what combination of powder, water and vinegar I use, I cannot get it to a smooth consistency.  It is more like cottage cheese.  It doesn't go on easily, it doesn't feel good and I am not sure that it is making my skin look any better.  It is just ok.",2
3,"I use it on my daughter, it's a tiny bottle for BIG PRICE. I don't think I will buy more since it didn't make any diffrence in her hair.",2
3,Large bar for the money and I am not one who know a lot about soap.,2
3,I received this razor through a program from Gillette.  I shaved everyday in the shower with this razor and the first 4 shaves were great.  After the first 4 I could tell the blades were getting a bit dull and had to re-shave the same areas 3 or 4 times to remove the hair that used to be removed in one pass. I would continue to use this razor if the blades would last a whole week.,2
3,I like it! However it doesn't stay baby pink for long and becomes a natural stain for my lips,2
3,Very watery.  I would have liked it to be thicker.,2
3,I thought it would be a little more moisturizing.  I have very curly hair and somewhat dry so a little disappointed.  I don't think I would order again.  Better conditioners on market for moisturizing and preserving hair color and cheaper.,2
3,Used to love this perfume. Either my tastes have changed or the formula has changed,2
3,It is ok.,2
3.0,"I freaking LOVED this stuff, but it broke me out :(  Probably the silicones.  If you don't have such sensitivities, I HIGHLY recommend for it's beautiful long lasting finish.",2
3.0,It did nothing for my hair.,2
3,this machine is awesome<br /> and works amazing however I noticed the new modelwas valued at the same price. the machine itself is amazing however the needle give adjuster loosens easy. other than the shifty pricing even the older version seems to work amazingly well,2
3,"FAIR, AT BEST.  WAS DISAPPOINTED IN PRODUCT.  DOESN&#34;T APPEAR TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO REALLY REPLACE REGULAR FLOSSING WHICH IS A BOOR.",2
3,"It has a pleasant scent, like peaches, a little fruity.  Its a very light feeling spray and I applied it liberally into my hair and worked it through with my fingers.  It does make my long and a bit coarse (like horse hair) dark hair feel lighter and gives a refreshing feeling.  I'd put it the equivalent of a body spray only just for hair.  It does NOT take the place of an actual wash.  It just freshens up your hair and makes it smell nice.  I've read in other reviews about clogging.  I have not yet experienced that but if the user is paying for their product that huge detractor.  But based strictly on my on use I give it a middling rating.  Again not a replacement for a real hair wash, but it is a pleasant refreshing experience if you have to just go a little longer than usual before washes.  Added Note: Yes, after a couple uses my bottle clogged up as well.",2
3.0,"It is working ever so slowly but is working ! Once you get past the look of it,  it is okay.",2
3,I am trying many cleansers for my adult acne. It's working fine but after this bottle is done I will go back to the mud wash.,2
3,"I should have read the other reviews more closely regarding the smell.  It definitely has a cooking oil smell to it and the barest hint of coconut.  I'm African American with coily, curly hair.  I like how it moisturizes, so a couple times a week I put it on my hair at night with a shower cap (to preserve my pillowcases) and use another hair lotion come morning to cover the cooking oil smell.  My hair stylist also suggested I rinse out the coconut oil the morning after I use it to help with the smell.  Supposedly since it's a rinse and not a wash, the oils will be retained.  I haven't tried that since I tend to switch up products, but plan to see how that works.",2
3,"The fabric is super soft, which is nice, but the band is really too tight for comfort.  Because it is so tight, it slips back too far on my head if I try to put it behind my ears. So I have to use it covering my ears, which is not optimal. Otherwise, it will gradually slip over my entire head.<br /><br />I had a regular terry band, which I used for a few years - it was not super-soft fabric, but it got the job done, until it stretched out too much.  Of course, it only cost half of what this product costs. Maybe this band will loosen up in time. But because of the band's tightness and the price, I would not purchase this again.",2
3.0,"I've heard great raves about the Holika Holika brand so I decided to choose this product because it claimed to have sebum control and would help clear my skin. I have mild acne so I went in with not much expectation, but hoping it would at least help to make my skin less oily throughout the day. However, the foundation layers on with a slick shiny texture (probably from the sunscreen) and didn't last very long throughout the day. Rather than make my skin less oily, I would say it made it more, with a sweaty look. Still, it was nice that the product came VERY QUICKLY and also with a FREE SAMPLE of Misha BB cream which I tried and found to be very effective, not oiling up so easily and giving me a brighter white look. If I was to purchase from this seller again, I definitely would, but this time for the Misha BB cream.",2
3,"I just received my \\""Instant Smile\\"" teeth today.  I've never ordered anything like this before.  First of all, I want to refer to a previous review about the ridge on the back of the teeth.  It does make your teeth look too long and you can see your real gums when you smile.  SO, I decided to do something about it.  I tried clipping away the ridge with wire cutters and I broke the \\""Instant Smile\\"" plate into 3 pieces.  SO, I glued the pieces back together successfully (including one of my fingers) with superglue.  It worked (except for the fact that the superglue took a layer of skin off my finger).  They look brand new again. The biggest thing for me was getting the teeth to fit the way I wanted them with the beed mixture.  I finally did it and for the low price of this item I'm pleased with the product.  Even though I had to go through quite a lot to get to the end result.  But, that was my own fault.  I knew there was a ridge on the back of the teeth when I bought them.",2
3,"The stencils are stiff and difficult to use, but if you have patience, the eyebrows look good",2
3,I have very coarse hair and this comb didn't get hot enough for me. It's nice but just not for me.,2
3,"Unless the container is full,MIT will not pump fluid up to the dispenser.  It takes about 20-30 pumps to get fluid to the top.  No functional at all. I would not recommend it.",2
3,It doesnt do anything different than other products you can buy at any other drug store cheaper. It is just a serum like any other.,2
3,"I was attracted by the shape of the bottle thinking that it would make lipgloss application a little more fun and possibly easier (because normal dipping with a wand is so taxing).  As far as looks go, the bottle is sleek, but if you squeeze too hard too much comes out.  The lid has popped off while being jostled in my makeup bag, and if the squeezy bottle gets tapped the wrong way, the gloss squirts around in the cap, leaving the nozzle gloopy upon opening. As for the product, the sheen is faint, the consistency is average, and the formula is not very moisturizing.  It's fine for plain old lipgloss, but that's a lot to pay for funky packaging.",2
3,"I do love the colors, but the eyeliner colors do not stay on at all. If I put it under my eyes the color is gone in one hour. They go on nicely.",2
3,They are pretty smaller than what appears on the pics.,2
3,"I bought this thinking it would be great for my super oily skin. Wrong!<br /><br />Pros:<br />- 330 toffee matched my NC40 skin tone perfectly!<br />- Looked nice immediately after I applied it<br /><br />Cons<br />- Not matte at all! It's not as dewy as regular foundations but it's not matte at all. Not even semi-matte.<br />- Made my face look like one big oil slick after 30 minutes. I tried a finishing powder to no avail.<br />- Transfers very easily<br />- Catches on to uneven patches of skin. If your skin is baby smooth, expect this to highlight that fact<br />- Claims to minimize pores. Wrong again! I have fairly large pools but this pooled in them and made them look like CRATERS!<br /><br />I had high hopes for this but if you don't like their previous Fit Me foundations then you probably won't like this one either. Such a shame since it looks perfect for about a hour... However, this may work from some skin types.",2
3.0,"The curling wands are great, the straightener totally the opposite.",2
3,"While this product does freshen your breath & get the overall gunk off, I have to say that unless you rinse your mouth out well beforehand you'll have gunk left in your teeth.<br /><br />I tried these over a 2 month period (I bought quite a few of them on sale) & I was underwhelmed. The first go-round I found little bits of gunk stuck in my teeth, which made me have to rinse my teeth out liberally afterwards & floss. After I rinsed my teeth out well beforehand, I had better results.<br /><br />I'd recommend these for when you want to get a bit of a fresher breath during work but haven't had a meal or anything. If you've drank some coffee & want to avoid the coffee stench afterwards, this is the thing for you. Otherwise you'd be better off just brushing & flossing as normal.",2
3,"My nails get thinned out with all the gel UV manicures. And since I like the Seche brand for its quick dry, I wanted to try this out.",2
3,"This was purchased for my guy 9 months ago for Christmas 12'. It lasted fairly well, with regular use till recently the brush handle came apart, but can be repaired/ glued easily. The heavyweight plastic it's made of is fairly sturdy but nothing close to metal. For 25$ it has done the Job well as an \\""on the counter set\\""",2
3,I bought this brush to replace the awesome one from Mary Kay that I had. MK stopped selling theirs so I was looking for a comparable product. This was not it! Gave it 3 stars since it does still do the job. I use it for loose powder application every morning. Its small and putting the cap over the bristles is not easy. Quality is under par for me. I will have to replace a lot sooner than the MK brush.,2
3,"I like the color of this. I wish it had an SPF in it. And I also wish it wasn't so tacky. I  have to to put a clear chap stick over to of it otherwise my lips actually stick together...great product, just needs a few tweeks.",2
3,The shipment and delivery were really fast. Great quality. I'll have enough of this product for months at the best price!,2
3,I like it but mine came broken with 2 cracks :( Packaged poorly,2
3,They are what they are and they do what they do. Nothing special here is a good everyday product that does what it says it will do.,2
3,"If you are a shy type of guy who doesn't want to be noticed, than this is the perfect cologne for you.  It stays close to the skin and smells respectable yet ordinary.  You will fit in no matter what the surrounding with this juice.  Subtle is the one word I would use to describe this fragrance. This is an average cologne for someone looking to fit in like camo.",2
3,"The motor on this thing is really loud. The pulsing thing is a bit weird, but I guess it's there for a reason. I kind of wish there was an option to have the water come out in a normal flow instead of the pulsing action.<br /><br />Other than that, it works fine as a water flosser. The pressure is a little weak (I'm not sure why anyone would use a setting lower than 8, and 10 doesn't seem like overkill), but the higher settings work fine.",2
3.0,Apparently I'm allergic to Badger hair.  Had to send it back.  It may be fine for someone without allergies though.,2
3,"I have a smaller head for a woman, and the narrow size fit me perfectly without slipping.  The nosepiece is stationary and cannot be adjusted, but fits well on the nose bridge for my size, and they are lightweight.  They have a rectangular eye shape, and if worn a little low on the bridge of the nose, you can read, yet look over the top of the frame for a larger view of the surroundings.  The plastic lenses give a clear, non-distorted view, so they are good for reading.  The ear pieces are wide, as shown in the photo.  In my personal opinion, it's obvious that they are not expensive readers.  The finish appears a bit cheap looking to me and I threw away the cheap case.  I feel they are overpriced.  I may order from this company again, but I will not purchase these &#34;designer look&#34; readers again.",2
3,"I had very high expectations for this polish, but i was let down.  I really would've liked this polish more if it was more opaque.  I was planning on using this color for manicures or designs, but that's hard to do because you need to use multiple coats for it show up. If you just wanted a white polish, then it isn't that bad, i just wish it was more opaque.",2
3.0,"Good brush, applied well, no smearing or clumping but was not thick enough for me - will try a thicker version by the same vendor next time",2
3,"I tried the set several times, in several different ways, using different sizes of the rollers.  The set started out way too curly with all sizes. Within several hours, my hair was limp.  I have thick hair and this just didn't do it for me.  I'm not too impressed with the return process either. I had to wait for my return to be authorized, then had to go to the post office to pay for the return shipping.  I guess I'm more accustomed to easy returns from other companies that let me print a prepaid shipping label and set it on my front porch for the mailperson to pick up.",2
3,Falls apart,2
3,"Definitely doesn't last 2 weeks. I've seen great reviews on YouTube, so I was very excited to get this home to try. Application is very easy but for best results I recommend using your own angled eyeliner brush to apply the dye with. My eyebrows are very sparse so most of the dye stuck to my skin (which I liked) but it didn't last long like I was promised. Maybe if you have more hair it will stick to the skin better. I didn't try the wax strips because I'm too skeptical of premade wax strips.",2
3,"The lipstick itself feels somewhat sticky and dry, since I can't find this color in the drugstore anymore it is probably discontinued and what I purchased may be old, but since I did't pay very much it's o.k.",2
3,"Product does add some amazing shine, but it also leaves my hair kind of greasy especially at the roots. I end up covering the top of my head with a towel and spraying around it. This would be perfect for the beach when hair is a little dry from sun/sea. If you have thin hair be careful with this product.",2
3,very nice packaging but that's about it. it's overpriced for the sizes save your money buy a cheaper better quality item(s),2
3.0,"The color is a lot darker than expected. The smell is wonderful,, but the product leaves my lips feeling greasy",2
3.0,Very very small. See tiny bic lighter comparison.,2
3.0,The soap did work as well as I hoped. Better off with shaving cream.,2
3,"This seems like a watered down version of the Jhirmack in the silver bottles for gray hair, that I really love.",2
3,ok,2
3,Did not have the same wonderful smell as the lotion.,2
3,I thought it was bigger.. But I still like it,2
3,This has a lovely lather acompanied with lemon Overtones. There is a bit of a squeak to my skin after rinsing. A drawback to usage: lasts a month,2
3,"So far I have tried this product with only one razor blade, and number of shaves are no where near what it promises. Not sure if it is due to the brand of blade (not Gillet) I used. I still need to try on a Gillet blade which seems to have gotten more shaves for more people per their reviews.",2
3,"I've been using the product for a few weeks now and I really do see a difference in my skin, especially this time of year (winter/fall) when it tends to be really dry.  I really like the cream, it's not too thick, or greasy, it's very light and silky when you apply it and I really think it does work.  My only issue is that the fragrance of the cream is a little strong for me, it's a bit too perfume-y, other than that--great product.",2
3,The cream seemed to dry out the toenails and then they would break off. This product might work for some but doesn't do much for me.,2
3,"Most tubes of toothpaste are over 6oz, so these almost look like travel tubes.  Good toothpaste, but I've never seen tubes this size in a store.",2
3,"Was a nice gift for my boyfriend. The product is definitely sleek and attractive. He said it worked well for the first few months. Every now and then, he's complain of skin getting caught in the wrong place.",2
3,"Pretty good shaver for the $$. You have to run it MANY times over your face to get a reasonable shave and it is not a terribly \\""close\\"" shave but it is good for a quick shave when there is not much time. When a really close shave is needed, probably best to go with a blade...",2
3,Haven't used it more than 4 times....no miracles yet!,2
3.0,"Way too perfumy smelling.  Works great, but the scent is overpowering.",2
3,Didn't smell as good as last bottle I purchased.,2
3,"I like this moisturizer because it is reasonably priced, it comes with a good quantity per bottle, and is usually moisturizes with one application (except on those really dry days in the winter). My only complaint is that it is supposed to be for sensitive skin but it stings my eyelids and the skin around my eyes, which is the most sensitive skin of all. I have had this problem with their sensitive skin face wipes too so there must be something I can tolerate in the formula. This moisturizer also takes a little longer to absorb than others, sometimes I will have white streaks on my face for 2 minutes - just like with sunscreen. The absorption time is a non issue since it is a night cream and there is no waiting to put makeup on. Besides the stinging around my eyes this is a good product.",2
3,"Not terrible, but not the scent I found in Athens. Will keep searching.",2
3,I bought this thinking i was getting 2- 4.5 oz containers but it was 2.25 oz I will learn i read and still can't  see anything,2
3,"I like the products, but the shampoo texture I was not to happy with.  It seems to work well, I don't need to blow dry to make it straight which is a plus.  I gave it 3 stars because the scent could be better, I would like to have the scent last on my hair longer as well.",2
3,"I like very much, but the say waterproof it's not just if you put hand on you can take off easy",2
3,It's ok if this is the type of nail dryer you are looking for. I bought it without looking it over. It is battery powered and does not come with any. I haven't used it yet but I did try it out it seemed like it would be slow to dry your nails.,2
3,This works well.  A little awkward to hold and use but otherwise good product.,2
3,I did get it promptly but I have to say that the head itself isn't great. The hair is pretty skimpy and by the time I straighten out the bottom it will definitely not be 24 inches.,2
3,"I honestly don't get the hype about Aveda Products.  This product wasn't awful in the sense that it didn't do any kind of damage to my hair, but it wasn't all that fantastic either in the sense that I didn't notice any noticeable difference in my hair texture.  I bought it because my hair was a little dried out from all the straightening and it may have helped a little in that arena, but what I ultimately think I am looking for is a leave in moisturizing treatment for my flyaways problem.  I was disappointed to learn that Aveda doesn't have such a product.",2
3,ALL OK,2
3,"I am a bit disappointed because the attachment that allows it to move up and down 4 inches does not stay where I tighten it. It seems to slip down to the bottom constantly. I am wondering if perhaps a part was missing from the package so for that reason I am only rating this as a 3 star. However, the mirror itself and the workmanship are sturdy enough everywhere else. In order not to be frustrated with this I am going to have to figure out how to fix this problem. I am hoping I can. By the way, this product is made in China and distributed through a Canadian company called Danielle LTD, which is a subsidiary of a Canadian soap company. Just FYI, buyer beware about all of this. If I had read any reviews about the height adjustment not working properly I never would have purchased this. Not sure if this is just a damaged/incomplete product or if this is the case with all of them. Just think everyone should know about this before purchasing. This is new review as of September 22nd, 2013. I received this item about 3 days ago and installed it two days ago.",2
3,To dark of a orange. Not was i was looking for but came fast.,2
3,"I guess this is okay for people who like self tanners, I thought this was a regular tinted lotion (the shimmer kind) but it's not.",2
3.0,Its okay.,2
3,"This one is Not as effective as Cerave moisturizing cream, I highly recommend Cerave for Eczema treatment.  The cetaphil makes my daughter's skin smoother but not really has the same effect of keeping her skin moisturized.",2
3,"well, i like it okay but the lid wasn't fitting properly as the cylinder was too small- in order to fit the lid on i had to stretch the cylinder and it has cracked. it functions okay but now has an ugly crack down the side.",2
3,It didn't really thicken my hair.  It made my hair stiff and hard to handle.  I just didn't help me at all.,2
3,"I used to wear this in middle school and high school. After the store I used to buy it at closed, i couldn't find it in town anywhere. I have tried to find it for a long time, so when I saw it on her I was excited. But.... It smells differently than it used to. Not a huge difference, but it was my favorite perfume so it is a little disappointing. You do get a large bottle though, so that is a good thing. I just wished it smelt the same.",2
3,"Its good, a bit of a problem where the button placement is located. As I am pressing my hair, it sometimes turn off which is annoying, but none the less it does a good job.",2
3,"Didn't realize I was receiving a tester. When I ordered, the description said new. When it was shipped, it was shipped as a tester. can't really complain for the price, but it seems like a rip off to ship tester products. Also, NO CAP was included. Lame.",2
3,Not what I expected.  Would not recommend.,2
3,"I spent quite a while researching combined firming and tanning products.  This product got a high rating from other reviewers, however, I have not seen the &#34;firming&#34; work at all and after using the product for 4 weeks, the tanning is &#34;ok&#34;.  It was also noted the scent was great.  This, too, is an exaggeration.",2
3,"The unit works well.  Difficult to keep toothpaste and salave from running down your chin.  If I had it to do over, I would have bought a cheaper version Sonicare unit.  The price is not justified.",2
3,Just Didn't like that nail polish doesn't come with the colors on each bottle,2
3.0,Kinda good. Well liked at first. Trashedbem after a wile. Air bubbles... What else to say. Seller never did respond.,2
3.0,"I used this product once. It smells great and exfoliates great. However, my skin was extremely dry after using the product. So that is a no in my book! I don't want a product that is going to make my skin dryer; That is the last thing I need.",2
3,"I read all the hype and decided to go for the \\""best\\"" electric out there. I have an average beard and get a quick and excellent shave with this razor, but not $200 better than the Norelco I was using. My criticism is that Braun has added lots of lights, \\""bells and whistles\\"" to the razor, and especially to the included cleaning console, which jazz up the items and the price but which are functionally insignificant or unnecessary. I can't believe that the average guy, in a hurry to get off to the job, is going to pay any attention to things like status LEDs that give information that no one needs.  And who wants to spend $10 a month for $1 worth of cleaning alcohol and the hassle of recharging the console when hot tap water cleans effectively?    Braun should offer what is a fine razor for half the price and without the cleaning and charging console, or ridiculously overdone packaging,  for the man who values true function and doesn't need or want the fanciful trappings. Then I would recommend it to you or my friends. For now, your money is better spent elsewhere.",2
3,"I have a top of line Brum shaver, getting this one just for back up and the travel shaver.  <br />I tried it in shower, not quite a clean shave, and you still need to look in the mirror to not miss any thing. Slight after shave burns. <br />As a dry shaver it is not nearly as good as my other ones. But does an OK job for traveling. Not that small either. It is about the half of the weight, so I was going to take it to Mt. Everst just for the weight (not ideal, but lighter than my full size one), but I left it at home by mistake anyway. <br />The only good things are you can wash it in water, and takes regular batteries.",2
3,not worth $20,2
3,"As described, shipped promptly, packed well, lowest price I could find on the Internet plus had the Amazon guarantee. My hair is normal. This conditioned seems to work too well on taming my hair. When I use it, my hair seems to loose it's shine and requires I wash it more frequently. I have this same problem with other conditioners, and hoped that by buying a higher rated conditioner that my situation would improve...it did not. therefore, I am looking for a replacement conditioner.",2
3,"it doesn't fit on to my normal conair dryer that well but it stays. once you start using it, it'll get super hot and eventually mold on to it anyways. i'm a little scared it might be a fire hazard, i can start to smell something sort of burning after a couple of minutes. it's convienant that the bottom comes off since i have hair that's mid-back length. it doesn't curl like the infomercial of the &#34;hair curler&#34; but it gives me very subtle soft beach waves which i'm still ok with.",2
3,"I had high hopes for this body butter because of the rave reviews it got on Amazon. I should have known better than to stray from Body Shop products but a few reviewers on Amazon said it was \\""just as good\\"" and less money so I took the bait. What can I say? I got burned. The thing I love about Body Shop products (as opposed to ones like this or like Bath & Body Works products) is that Body Shop products smell like the scents they're supposed to -- and nothing else. Whereas cheaper butters like this one have that cheap perfume-y undertone in the scent that ends up being the dominant smell; I HATE THAT!! So five minutes after applying the cheap butter you don't smell so much like coconut as you do like cheap perfume with just a hint of fake coconut smell. If you're a big fan of Bath and Body Works products then you will probably like this stuff and find it's a great deal. However, if you are more of a purist when it comes to scent and truly want to smell like coconut -- and only coconut -- when you apply a coconut body butter, then I suggest you look elsewhere or stick with body shop products because this stuff smells cheap. I guess you get what you pay for.",2
3.0,Not sure I see/feel much of a difference with this product.  It's a bit pricey so perhaps I'm expecting a lot of frizz control.,2
3,"I'm not sure how much this is helping me. I use the cellulite massager brush mitt to rub it in most of the time. I have noticed a slight change after about three weeks of using in the firmness of my skin. Granted, I also work out five days a week. I had issues with birth control that caused me to have weird-looking cellulite on the fronts of my legs. I also have the standard cellulite on the backs (top) of my legs. I was hoping this would get rid of it, especially on the front, because my legs are pretty muscular and not fatty. Unfortunately, the cellulite is still there.<br />Also, this product goes QUICK and does not last long at all. I'm almost out already, and I've used probably every other day for three weeks.<br />It also sometimes leaves a weird residue that makes it look like my legs are peeling. I probably won't be reordering.",2
3,I didn't notice a difference but I love instanatural products,2
3,"The original listing that I bought from confused me somewhat and whereas I thought I was getting 3 bottles, I got only one.  I contacted the seller, Forefront Nutra, and they cleared up the confusion and offered me a full refund, including shipping, or the opportunity to buy another bottle and get one free.  After a month of taking the product, I could not see any change in the roots of my hair.  I am not convinced this means anything as I recently heard on TV how hair goes through growing cycles and sleeping cycles, so it may be that one needs to take this long enough to get into the changing hair cycles.  So, I am giving it a 3-stars in that while it didn't make any difference in a month's time, with longer use, it might do something.",2
3,"This wig looks amazing at first, but gets frizzy very quickly, and is slightly disappointing.",2
3.0,"Not to be a five star bubble burster, but it costs $11, there's a reason for that.  It is inexpensive, a good thing, but I've had nowhere near the results of other lower mid level brushes ($35 and below).  During the breakin, I thought I was brushing with the butt end of my dog, hairs everywhere.  That subsided a bit, but in side by sides with my other brush, very different.  Still learning here, but brushes do make a difference, and you don't have to spend a fortune to find one.  Just didn't quite see this as the $11 treasure that some others have.",2
3,"I was hoping for an effective antiperspirant and/or deodorant, but alas this is not that product.  It feels like it controls perspiration, but it seems to fall short on the deodorant side.<br />I will keep on hunting for the perfect product.",2
3,It worked well for a few months. I´ve tried to used last week and it was heavy and I have to throw it away.<br /><br />It was only half bottle used,2
3.0,These were cute nails but the 4 shown are the only ones in the package with the gems. The rest have a silver stripe there. Still cute but for me the gems were only on the first finger.,2
3,"The product was good, it works, i would recommend this........but the only problem that I have, one of the brushes were broken. The company have told me that they would send another brush to me. So I'm still waiting for the company to send me a replacement brush. I'm not pleased and waiting for my brush!",2
3.0,I really didn't read the reviews….I can't deal with it being a plug-in item. I wouldn't have purchased it had I known. It's a fabulous product otherwise but such a pain to not be cordless/chargeable.,2
3,This is a good thick lotion. The only problem for me is that is highly scented and is more likely to be used by women than men.,2
3,This soap has a fragrance that is very nice but I found that it  is not thick enough for the soap pump.,2
3,"I started trying this product to reverse the signs of aging and I was told to do that in your early 20's. I'm 22 with multiple skin problems. When I started using this product, I did start to see results within a week. My pores had gotten noticeable smaller and my skin felt more moisturized and seemed to be glowing, even without makeup. After 2 weeks, however, I noticed I started to break out even more so. I had quit using my usual acne wash system to use this product. I figured it might be ok because the cream cleanser had salicylic acid which usually works for me, in regards to acne. But, even with the salicyclic acid, and continued use of this product, Ive noticed my face breaking out even more. I think for me, because I tend to break out easily with certain products, I will start integrating both this and my acne wash system to completely satisfy my needs. :)",2
3,"Nice formulation, It has a minty tingle and stays on well, but this is nothing like any of the swatches for the color &#34;romantic&#34; that I've seen online- this is a cherry tootsie pop, 14 year old girl dressed like a hooker red. I have pale skin with a golden undertone and red hair, and it looks clownish on me- the swatches and such suggested that the color would have an orange or burgundy brown look to it, it doesn't. It will probably look fine layered with another color, but it doesn't end my eternal search for the perfect lip stain.",2
3,"I didn't care for this moisturizer that much, works ok, but the smell was a little off for me and I didn't see the miraculous results the ad proclaimed.  I didn't notice much difference in my wrinkles eaither, but then, it will take more than a miracle to overcome the ravages of aging!! Can't blame the product for that. Its an ok moisturizer.",2
3.0,"I have combination skin and so I thought this moisturizer would do the trick: absorbing excess oil where it needs to and moisturize the places that are too dry. I've been using this for about 2 weeks now.<br />I felt my oil on my face being completely absorbed by this but not long afterwards (maybe a few hours) my face would get oily again.. So, I thought, &#34;Well, if this really absorbs the oil, I'll try re-applying it to see if my oil which is already on my face will get absorbed&#34; and voila, it was so drying and oil-absorbing that it made my face oil-free again. Ultimately, I have mixed feelings about this. It absorbs the oil well, while you still have oil on your face, but the fact that I would have to RE-APPLY this moisturizer for my face to be less oily seems somewhat redundant.<br />This is an oil-absorber rather than a moisturizer...",2
3,Good purchase.,2
3,"I LOVE this fragrance, but it vanishes almost instantly. I think the hand lotion fragrance lasts longer than the eau de toilette.",2
3,"This hair lasted for a while but then it began to shed like crazy! it never really matted up or nothing but when I had to comb out a kink in it, more and more strands would fall out!! Lol but the hair was still soft I guess. he shedding was just unbearable!!",2
3,"Okay - I did a double take at the label (designer) when I first spotted this cologne... I am sure there are others...<br /><br />To quote one of my golfing buddies on a trip in years past, \\""Harry, your coffee ain't bad - but, it is not that good either...\\""  When trying Friction, that was my first thought.  This same guy is also noted for saying, \\""golf is just something you do while drinking beer..\\"" Not sure I have tried a cologne that will fit that quote - but you never know..!!<br /><br />Friction is not a bad fragrance - it starts out with citrus and musk notes that finishes into a decent spicy fragrance.  It is generic and is a \\""copy cat\\"" to many fragrances out there.  The longevity, projection, and sillage are below average - lasting only a couple of hours close to the skin.  The fragrance does offer flexibility or versatility as it can be worn to any event at any time of the year - just take the bottle with you to reapply (frequently) as needed.  No compliments on this one thus far and it may not be worn enough to provide any follow-up down the road.<br /><br />I do like the bottle and packaging - it gives the impression of an expensive and high-end fragrance.  Additionally, the price/value is above average.<br /><br />My tally for Friction is 3 stars out of 5 stars.  It has a \\""catchy\\"" name (designer), nice looking bottle, and comes at a bargain price.  Only if you are the avid collector would I recommend.  Always finish what you started - you will be amazed at what you can accomplish..",2
3,The handle on the brush is too big to hold easily and the button to make it spin is awkward to push and hold.,2
3,Bottled solutions are labeled!!,2
3,thin,2
3,"This is a fair cleanser, and needs to only be used once a day.  I have normal/oily skin and since it dried my skin; it made it oilier during the day.  I had to use a stronger moisturizer after using this to wash my skin at night.  It is not a stand-out cleanser and does not have any cooling effect as the name implies but is good enough to clear our minor blemishes and minor breakouts; major acne breakout will need a better cleanser.  Other topical acne medication and creams combined with the use of ice cleanser definitely caused itchy skin for me so if you have severe or major acne this is not a cleanser you can use.",2
3,As expected.,2
3,"I have been using L'oreal's Men's Expert anti pale cream, but because I could not find it for some reason, I bought this, which was highly recommended, but do not really like it. It is too orange for my skin. Maybe it will work for some other type of skin, but I am not very happy with it. I much rather use Men's Expert, which also has a sun block, that Anthony's doesn't have. This also works and smells exactly like a much cheaper Australian Gold self tanner I once had.",2
3.0,Good price but lather is too &#34;soft&#34; it foams and breaks down once on face compared to higher priced soaps.,2
3,"It is what was expected, I've used it before.",2
3,"It's ok, you have to do a lot of coats to get it to look good",2
3,It's not quite as good as I expected. One nozzle doesnt work very well. It is very convenient though.,2
3,"Unfortunately even waiting the 15 minutes after application and reapplying every hour, sunburn is still an issue.",2
3,The product description did not include the number of disposal bags included.  My mistake as the number of bags provided was considerably fewer than expected for the cost.,2
3,"Large gift set a lot of different options, good price aroma is tolerable, manly , not as long lasting as others.",2
3,"Is a good product but will not buy it anymore: it is regular hand soap with water, so for the same price I just buy soap and add the water.",2
3,"Yikes, I can't believe these cost this much! First off, I got a free Simple Skincare pack to test from BzzAgent.com, so I had no idea how much these costed til now. Knowing how much they cost, I probably wouldn't buy them if I saw them at the store unless they were cheaper. They did their job, they weren't harsh on my skin, they didn't have any overpowering scents and they weren't oily. However, some of the moisture got in my eye and boy did it sting for at least five minutes. I much prefer the [[ASIN:B00AO4EMKQ Simple Radiance Wipes, 25 Count]] wipes, but these weren't TERRIBLE. The packaging sealed nicely though!",2
3.0,Bought this in July 2012 - stopped working inexplicably October 2014.  Just refuses to turn on. Loved it but obviously not so much anymore.,2
3,I bought three different hair products to help style hair in to rolls or buns and this was the best. My hair is almost to my waist which made the other productsnot really work to good. But the hot Bunz and the way it's made worked just great...,2
3,couldn't tell any difference,2
3.0,"The color is like pink, so different from the picture",2
3,Not as soft as I was hoping for with this wrap. It will fall off if you don't wrap it well enough but so does any silk/satin scarf. I just think the stitch pattern makes it a bit too rough to use on my hair. I found another scarf on Amazon that was better for a couple dollars more.,2
3,I noticed no difference in my pores when using this product.,2
3,"It's ok. Heats up quickly barrel size is just right. Only negative, does not glide through hair while loosely clamped when styling.",2
3,No carrying pouch was provided with the product. I bought a similar Remington shaver before and it had a pouch and a brush to clean the shaver.,2
3,It was ok,2

If you don't mind the ingredients its an ok product and was actually gentle on my hair.",2
3,"I thought I was going to love the concave styling on this brush.  In reality, I am not so sure.  Perhaps it's because the bristles are much tighter than on the round brush it was to replace, maybe just my hair, but it does not seem to want to hold onto the section I am working like I am used to.  The end result is my hair looks far less styled & more like I let it air dry.  This means it looks somewhat frizzy rather than sleek with a gentle curl at the bottom.  I have ordered another brush more like the one I am accustomed to, but will keep using this one for the time being in the hope that I can improve my results with more practice.  It is a lovely brush and appears to be well made.<br /><br />UPDATE 12AUG2015:  I found another concave brush, also from Spornette, that works better on my hair.  [[ASIN:B002LYTT7S Spornette Pronto Concave Brush, 2.5-Inch Diameter]]",2
3,Arrived early than expected. Great colors & good quality. Small flat case & easy to store. Worth $10 not $20.,2
3,I don't care too much for this blush most of the color don't show up. I am a caramel color as I have a tan and only blush that is even worth me using is the one in the top far right corner.,2
3,Purchased for the misses.  She likes it so I do as well.,2
3,"Just bought some of this stuff at Wholefoods.  It was reasonably priced ($8) and contained sufficient amounts of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide.  I believe they just started making this formula without the Oxybenzone.  So it now has a rating of 2 on EWG site.  An important plus for me, because I tend to use sunscreens daily, is that it easily blends in clear.  Though I have not put it to the test on a beach day, I'm sure some of the solid zinc formulas do a better job at protection (like Badger?).",2
3,Why did this come opened no seal it could be anything in the bottle???,2
3,Meh. It's ok. Not as strong as I expected.,2
3,"I applied these to my nails rather easily and they look beautiful. I didn't have any problems with bubbling and I'm sure I can get 2 manicures from a pack. I just put them on so I'm not sure how long they will last, hopefully at least a week. By the way, don't apply a clear coat over the top, it will damage them.",2
3,The water container leads,2
3,"Came quick, but the bottle had been opened and re-packaged. It leaked a little before getting to me. I guess it doesn't say its scented I just assumed. But I got it for the glitter and for the price you can't complain",2
3,"I didn't see a difference. It made my hands feel drier directly after use,",2
3,"it's fine for curling irons and flat iron, metal construction is nice and durable, however it is too small for any blow dryer I have seen",2
3,Flexball definitely seems like a gimmick. Noticed no difference to non-flexball ones.,2
3,"I would like to point out that these are perfumed. So when it's on your face, you will be smelling perfume. I hate perfume, so I will not be ordering these again.",2
3,"I had this product for about six months.  When I first used it, I was expecting it to be like a gel of some sort.  Kind of like Kinky Curly Curling Custard (KCCC).  It did not work like it at all.  For starters, it is much more oily and a bit looser than KCCC.  It is hard to explain but I had KCCC and while it was slimy, it didn't leave oil trails.  With this product, it was harder to gather in your hands and much more slippery.  I applied it on damp and dry hair.  It didn't define curls as I hoped so I put it away in my closet, planning to give it away to a cousin of mine.<br /><br />While doing a yearly closet purge, I forgotten that I had this in my possession.  I decided to use it again.  After I did a conditioner washed, I applied a fairly generous amount combed my hair back into a ponytail and tied a scarf around my hair.  My hair was defined but frizzy at the same time.  So what I did was use some Eco Styler gel (that I am trying to use up) and applied it over my hair and tied my scarf around. It worked for me that way. My hair wasn't left hard and I didn't form any flakes when I did it this method. I was elated to find a use for it because I hate wasting product.  I will use it up but I will doubt I will purchase again.  There are too many products out there for me to try.  I feel that this might work for someone with a looser and less porous hair than mine.  I hope this helps someone.  And please remember that your mileage may vary with any hair product.",2
3,I didn't see that much difference the first two weeks that I've use it.  Maybe in a month I will see some improvements.,2
3.0,I use these for blending eyebrow pencil. The sponge tops come off easily. I fixed this by using Elmer's glue. Now they work.,2
3,"This polish goes on really well and has lots of micro glitter specks, but it's REALLY hard to get the bigger glitter pieces on your nail - I got maybe one on each nail the first try and had to manipulate the larger pieces on my nail manually - this has potential - but definitely needs MORE large pieces of glitter in it.",2
3,"I received a free sample of this toothpaste through Smiley360. I saw it mentioned sensitivity on the package and was glad to try it because I have very sensitive teeth and gums. The toothpaste DID burn my mouth similar to most other regular toothpastes. I use other sensitive toothpaste and it is much milder than normal, this toothpaste did not QUITE fit that bill. So this is not the best way to go if you're like me, but if you don't need sensitive toothpaste, then I'm sure this is fine.",2
3,First tube opened seemed a little on the watery side,2
3,Just okay...,2
3,It's really not worth the upgrade. You just pay an extra $100 for a glass and a different way to charge your brush. I don't feel any difference between this diamond clean and my previous model. Regret the purchase!,2
3.0,"I received a free sick of the secret outlast completely clean gel deodorant as part of a promotion from the brand. I hadn't realized I had used before.  I have a complex where I always think I smell,  so the idea of a 48 hour deodorant is ideal.  On days where the temperature is moderate and I don't do too much this works like a dream.  However,  it definitely doesn't last 48 hours,  and On hotter days and days I'm running around a lot I think it could do a better job.",2
3,"First off this item seems great, but while using it the first time I couldn't help being a little fearful that the water would somehow shoot up and burn my face/eyes.  Then I just read a review saying it did just that to someone and conair did nothing to recall the item, help pay hospital bills and treatment, which I hate to hear.  Anyway, if you're willing to risk it I'd say this seems to be an affective device.  It clears out my pores and seems to them look smaller as well as some acne cyst I have due to a medical condition I have.  I also pat the sweat off then add a facial mask to my opened pores. It seems to leave my skin super super soft and glowy.  Like many others have said the cone is a bit too small for your full face, but putting a towl over your head to conceal the steam does help that alittle.  The brush it comes with works great too and really cleans out my pores.  One other thing is even with eye cream on it really really dries out my eye (and causes redness to where it looks like I'm on drugs)to the point where they feel like they're burning and it makes me wonder if it could be causing damage to them.  Now after reading that awful review and having the burning feeling of my eyes (btw they were closed the whole time and my face wasn't directly fully inside the cone) I'm not so sure I'll be using this anymore.  I mean is it really worth damaging me eye sight? or getting my face burned? I may go back to boiling water in a pot it's seems safer and more controlled. DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE I CAN BUY REPLACEMENT HEADS LIKE THE BRUSH FOR THE FACIAL TOOL IT COMES WITH??",2
3,"I have been on a glitter nail kick as of late.  I ordered Rose of Light (also by OPI) and loved it so much that I went ahead and ordered Chasing Rainbows.  All the reviews swear that this glitter is amazing and can be worn alone or matched with any color.  It may have been the base color I chose.  There are these really pretty magenta glitter pieces so I decided to apply Miami Beet (2 coats) and this glitter on top.  So glad I started with my toes.  First, this glitter is pretty but the pieces are much larger than what I was accustomed to in Rose of Light.  And since I couldn't control the glitter distribution very well it made my toes just look messy.  Maybe I should try wearing this alone.  But the rainbow colors made me feel like I was 12 and I am definitely far from 12.  If I try again I shall update.",2
3,"Got a great deal on this lotion, but didn't see a whole lot of color....and was a little thin. Would be great for a beginner.",2
3,This product had many great reviews....but for me it made my skin burn seems to be a little harsh but the eye cream I enjoy and the face wash smells so good.,2
3,"Purchased this item based on other reviews, however the straightener made my hair feel very dry. Additionally it is much heavier and thicker than other brands out there.",2
3,"This stuff works slightly, you really have to put a lot in to get a result.  You can use it in other polishes as well.",2
3,"I bought this product due to its review and it was number 3 on the most effective product to clear blemishes. Apparently, it doesn't work for everybody. Did'nt work for me, obviously. I tried it for several weeks and the results was not great at all. I still have the blemishes I was trying to get rid off. It would have been nice if it at least lessened it. But, NO....it didn't work at all for me. I have oily skin and a few pimple scars from when I was pregnant with my 2nd child. It is better to use a scar remover. Now, those product works. It helped deminished some of the pimple scars I have. Might not work for everybody, too. But it certainly worked for me.",2
3,"I recieved these as a free sample from Sephora. The instructions are easy to follow, you rub your arm with the Tattoo Application pad, then carefully lay the temp tattoo onto the skin, then saturate it again with the application 2 to 3 times. You can lift the tattoo and check to see if you need to apply it again. Mine worked beautifully, didnt smudge at all, and It came out very realistic and vibrant.<br /><br />Edit: These only lasted maybe 1 1/2 days, they start to fade very very quickly. and dont even thinking about wearing clothes that might rub up against them.",2
3,Here is my take on the Ped Egg.  The first one I bought was pretty effective and would slough off a lot of dry calloused skin pretty quick.  Then follow up with a quick swipe of the emery pad and you were good to go!  About a year later I bought I new Ped Egg and I instantly noticed  a huge difference in the scraper blade!  It was more dull and it didn't do nearly as effective a job!  I think the company probably got too many complaints that people had rubbed down too deep and caused themselves to bleed.  I don't know how anyone could do that unless they weren't paying attention; but I think the result was that the company started making the blades more dull so they wouldn't incur the same damage.  So now all I use is the emery pads.  I don't even bother with the blade attachment at all.  It's a lot of work with hardly any results.,2
3,"L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect BB Cream does a very fine job of moisturizing my skin.  It is easy to use, requires very little product to get results, but remained \\""sticky\\"" feeling throughout the day.  Personally, I would use this more as a night moisturizer and use something different for daytime.",2
3,So i received my package today but there was no organ oil with the flat iron. I was a bit disappointed and felt lied too. The box said it's included but there was nothing there. Not very pleased.,2
3,I don't feel it helps be get as dark a tan as my other bronzers. But the price was good so I'll use it until it's gone.,2
3,"I have no problem with the product itself. However, I believe the photos shown for the Chestnut and the Espresso colors are reversed. I ordered the Chestnut but it's much lighter color than the photo of the pencil shown.",2
3,"Yes, as most of the other reviewers have stated the mouthwash isn't the most pleasant tasting.<br /><br />However, I have been using it for awhile and I can see the whitening effects. I do think that the mouthwash is odd, possibly even unique in it's flavoring. I believe this comes from the peroxide. However, it's not terrible. And, weighing it's pros and cons, I think I'd continue to use it. I think the taste of this honestly isn't as bad as the burn of Listerine. I do like that I can see the fizzing of the mouthwash between my teeth cleaning away bacteria.<br /><br />Overall, this one is a personal call. I don't think that the taste is enough to kill the use of the product, as I can see the positive results in both whitening and cleaning.",2
3,"I have heard great reviews about this product, but hasnt worked as good as I would h ave liked it to yet.. I still need to use it again to be sure!",2
3,"I'm not anheagy sweater so I thought this product would be good to try since it is healthier for your body, but doesn't prevent sweat. I'm not sure the purpose of it though because after a few weeks my armpits have never stunk so bad. I started using my husband's deodorant halfway through the day just to make the smell go away, which makes my deodorant pointless.",2
3,"too dark for me, otherwise ok",2
3,I like this item but I don't use it as much as I thought I would. It arrived in perfect condition and it arrived quickly. But not as useful as I expected.,2
3,Was not impressed the no aroma is not actually truthful as it does have a smell which I don't care for but in a pinch I will use it.,2
3,"Found this cologne perfect for an older man,  not suitable for a younger person. Smells ok but not a fragrance that would wow me.",2
3,"The title does say small in it, but these are really small.  I have thin hair so thought that I would be able to twist and clip up my hair.  They are just for a few pieces of hair.",2
3,"well, for what this cost, i really did expect more than what i got.......not the ammount, but the results.<br />i have used nearly the entire bottle, and really truly cannot see any difference in the texture of my skin.  I am not at all happy with the product",2
3,Does not work as well as it used too,2
3,"I received a generous sample of this sunscreen from my local med spa.  It goes on smoothly and adds just enough moisture to my dry skin to feel wonderful.  I am actually in love with it in terms of the way it feels when I put it on.  However, after doing research on sunscreens, I am unsure whether the level of protection is enough.  It has octinoxate and zinc oxide in it but both percentages are rather low.  According to what I have been reading on the Internet, the coverage is probably not enough if you want a great coverage level.  My Shiseido Sun Protection Lotion, which I love, but is not really a day cream and I need to use additional moisturizers with, contains 7.4% octinoxate and 16.3% zinc oxide while the IS Clinical product has 4.45% octinoxate and 2.94% zinc oxide.  From what I have been reading, the less than 3% zinc oxide is not really a desirable level if you want full UVA and UVB protection on your face every day.  Since I live in a sunny climate, that is what I want.  If anyone has any alternative information to show I am wrong, please let me know, because I do really like this sunscreen.  In the meantime, I will continue with my Shiseido sunscreen which I highly recommend.",2
3,Although the description says Titanium. I read every inch of the box and paperwork and nowhere did I see the word titanium.  It made me wonder whether or not I received the product as advertised.  I am very wary of Chinese made products as the quality is not always the best. On the bright side the dermaroller was sealed in plastic.,2
3.0,It's way over-priced because on top of the product I had to pay outlandish postage and got socked for import duties.  Not worth it!,2
3,"After using a whole bottle, I'm not sure this works.  I was working out, dieting, and exercising quite a bit while using this, and I did indeed lose weight and inches, but not sure I can attribute anything to this cream.  It may have had a placebo effect though :)",2
3,"it was beautiful hair at first, people were not lying about the smell of the hair either. Its just the hair starts to tangle period and to get it back to normal seems like you got to straighten it everyday, but if you just moisturize it every single day you will be ok",2
3,"GOT THIS FOR MY MOM, COLOR IS NOT AS DARK  AS IT SHOWS,",2
3,"These are basic, cheap-quality makeup pouches.  The smaller one is pretty much a standard size to fit in most purses, while the larger one is probably more useful for travel.<br /><br />Both have wipe-clean vinyl interiors, which is always a plus for makeup bags.  However, the material is very thin and flimsy.  The pattern on the smaller one (sailboats and ropes) leaves a lot to be desired.<br /><br />Overall, I'd give them an average rating.  I doubt anyone is going to open the box and think, \\""Wow!\\""<br /><br />If you're looking for a well-made (and funky) cosmetic case, I highly recommend the ones by Betsey Johnson. For example, this: [[ASIN:B00GYI8KFE Betsey Johnson Cosmetic Make Up Case Bag Skulls Mustache Fuchsia Multi]] I have two that I've used for years and the quality is great.",2
3,"I have used this product for years, and it always just eliminated my dandruff.  The last bottle I used does not seem to control my dandruff any longer.  I don't know if the product has changed or if I have become desensitized to the chemicals. I just know that I now have a dandruff problem.<br /><br />Dewey Reinhard",2
3,I love the color but it is like the liner it self is just a stick with wood loosely around it. That makes it very difficult to use.,2
3,"Very much liked them! The package arrived much earlier than expected which was a nice surprise! The bangs are incredibly soft and in my opinion don't look fake when worn. They are also very full bangs! I have thick hair so they don't look weird on me. I am yet to wear them out but will sooner or later I will. I definitely will buy another set just because I want to see how dark \\""jet black\\"" will be. Can't wait til I get the other set :D<br /><br />Update:Oh bundle monster what have you done! My first order of these bangs were fantastic and best of all they looked full! Now that I got my second set I am not happy! One of the bangs looks like part of an extension. It doesn't have hair covering the edges like the other ones do. And it was made differently from the first set that I received. Another one of the bangs is missing a little chunk of hair on the corner which I dislike! The other bangs are fine and the bow too. But I was really looking forward to this set and you've managed to not make me happy with it. I will not return them because I waited so long to get the black ones and don't want to wait any more. I will try to fix the messed up bangs and I hope that they do get fixed. Ugh I thought I was getting a great set. Be warned you, can either get a great set or an imperfect set. Will not be buying another set! :'(",2
3,"they dont look as natural as i'd like but i do the best that i can with them, i wouldnt order them again",2
3,"This system combines a manual razor and battery-operated trimmer/edger.      What's in the box:  1 battery-operated (1 AA battery) edger, 3 plastic trimming attachments, 1 Gillette Fusion proglide razor attachment (plastic) which attaches to the edger, 1 small tube of proglide shaving gel, and some coupons.   All the pieces attach and detach from the edger pretty easily.  The edger itself is small, not bulky, and seems to perform its intended task well, better than the edger on the electric shaver that I have been using for several years.  The razor provides a nice, close shave, but I don't know if I like it enough to give up my electric shaver.  I will continue to use the edger and trimming attachments.",2
3,"The peel off didn't come off smoothly and what was left required me to roughly rub a wet facial towel on my face. I love the clay masks the best and I think after this, I'll stick to those. I ended up giving the tube to a friend because I was so unimpressed.",2
3,"I've bought this serum after reading the glowing reviews from a lot of people.  I used it religiously for a month and nothing happened to my skin. Either my skin is totally unique and different from other people's, or a lot of those fawning reviews are too generous and lenient about the benefits of this serum.",2
3,something my mom wants,2
3,I'm not sure if the shampoo froze during delivery but it has turned into a clumpy gel.  It really dries out my hair.  The conditioner is okay but nothing great.  I love the Argan oil Serum and would definitely purchase it again but not the shampoo and conditioner.,2
3,"My wife loves the scent. Me? not as much. It's floral and baby powder, sweet and cloying. It would make a better winter scent. The good news is that it doesn't last long, about an hour, tops. It's heavy in alcohol content and light in glycerin so it actually does a good job as a bracing, stinging aftershave, which I like.<br />I use it on weekends when my wife is home with me. My wife gives it a 5 star, me a one star, which averages out to a 3 star review.",2
3,"Over the years I've tried a number of whitening products, some that work, but many, many more that don't. My teeth didn't need whitening, so I was a little hesitant to try this product, but I didn't really have anything to lose. I received it for free from BzzAgent.<br /><br />I was a bit surprised at the look and feel of the packaging when it arrived (it felt a little cheap), but it's not about the packaging - it's about the product! This came just before I went away on vacation and because I hate carrying one - no less two - tubes of toothpaste when flying (not to mention that I didn't know how my teeth would react to it), this stayed at home.<br /><br />I started using this product just about two weeks ago. The first step looks and goes on like a super-thick regular toothpaste. The product tastes like it should, but feels a little odd in the mouth - kinda gritty and thick. It took a while to get used to not completely getting the product out of my mouth, but once I got used to it it was no big deal. I got total dejavu when using the second step, but I can't for the life of me figure out why. It's a clear gel that you put on top of the residual first step to polish and whiten. But be warned - when they say use for 1 minute, do not go over that 1 minute! The whitening/polishing gel is potent and can irritate your gums and (temporarily) turn them white if left on for too long!<br /><br />Like I said, my teeth didn't need a whole lot of whitening to begin with, but I have noticed that they look a bit brighter since starting this regimen. The minty-ness always leaves my mouth feeling great afterwards, too, which is really what I'm looking for out of any toothpaste. My teeth and gums tend to be particularly sensitive to whitening products, so I probably won't use it again for at least another 6-12 months to keep sensitivity at bay, but I have been quite pleased with it so far. I am about half way through my sample and would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a whitening toothpaste that actually works.ing for a whitening toothpaste that actually works.",2
3,I purchased this in the beginning of this month. I think it is a little overpriced for the quality. The massager cannot fit in with the travel bag that comes with it. I tried it a couple times I think it works but I would go for something else cheaper.,2
3.0,After 3 months my lotion turned dark green and stained my skin a green garbage color. I don't know what the shelf life is of this product and therefore I'm giving the company the benefit of the doubt and gave 3 stars. I would never buy again knowing I couldn't use in the winter and save to use again in the summer. Waste of my money.,2
3,"This product is decent. It works like most others. I don't think it does that well at controlling frizz, but definitely does do an okay job. I do think it has a bit more greasy feel to it than when you use mousse for example. I guess that tends to make your hair a bit more crunchy. This is softer, but definitely has a bit of grease to it. The product was fine, but nothing super impressive.",2
3,I suffer from a very extreme case of eczema on my hands and I decided to try this 'fragrance free' lotion. It has a very unpleasant smell to it. It kind of smells like play dough. It also leaves a slick greasy residue after about 30 minutes of application. I have since switched to the Aveeno - Stress Relief Moisturizing Lotion with Lavender and Chamomile (purple label). It is lightly frangranced and is a much better product in my opinion.,2
3,amazon listed this as the replacement pack for the shaver I bought (Braun 3Series 340S-4 Wet & Dry Shaver) but when I got the replacement blades etc it was not the right one as listed for my shaver. The amazon listing for the braun shaver should be the one that actually fits that certain shaver...so I had to return it and pay for the shipping to return it. Thus..could not really rate this item since it is the wrong one.,2
3,"Ok, it's a Dior Mascara. Only for being part of Dior family should allowed it to the perfect. But this is not what happens.  It doesn't work properly,it gets too much product on the comb, what will make you clean the eyes area after using it.  It's more like a cool toy because it rotates by itself but you won't miss it for not buying it.  I must confess that I will use the product with a regular comb.",2
3,"The rose scent here is pure and very old-fashioned, so I think it works better as a layering scent. I would also recommend getting a smaller cheaper bottle. I accidentally bought the 4oz and now have enough for the rest of my life.",2
3,"News flash guys: Women HATE back hair; shave it off!   I got this a month ago- It's a great idea that I'm surprised no one financed a long time ago! Unfortunately it's made super cheap for a forty dollar item; it's lightweight and feels just plain cheap! I don't like the way the hinge feels sloppy... but, my unit works fine and cuts good- actually too good.. it cut me up good! Once you learn how to angle it just so- and take your time w/ 50 mirrors around you- you'll do fine. I am glad to have the product on the market- I just hope they make it better.",2

3,"Oui is my all time favorite fragrance and I was so disappointed when Lancome stopped selling it. So naturally I was really excited to receive a bottle as a gift from my children this past Mothers Day. I have worn it a few times and I can't quite place it but there is something off about the smell, it just doesn't smell the way I remember it and the bottle is very different than pictured, it used to be an oblong, frosty, textured glass bottle as pictured but the one I received is just clear glass rectangular bottle. To boot I seem to get a dull headache every time I wear it (BTW- this is the link my children used to order it) I will wear it every now and again since it was a thoughtful gift from my kids and the smell is not terrible BUT it's def not my favorite perfume that I would want to wear every day, the original Oui fragrance would have been preferable.",2
3,"Sturdy, sharp, clips nails. Win.",2
3,I like the length and color but did not realize there is a permanent part in the middle that makes it hard to change the look. Also the part is supposed to look like scalp but is white and doesnt match my skin tone.,2
3,"Good Rinse...doesn't contain a bunch of unnecessary, potentially harmful ingredients, which really draws me to it.<br /><br />However, the directions are rather strange. It asks you to keep the mouthwash in your mouth the entire time while brushing, which proves to be very difficult and rather messy. especially since I use a Sonicare Diamond Clean toothbrush, which is extremely powerful.. It also seems to dissolve my toothpaste, which sounds strange, I know, but for some reason my toothpaste is gone immediately when I follow the suggested directions.<br /><br />I've tried to contact the company to ask about this (via their provided email address) and they never respond. I question if it's time to look elsewhere, but the ingredient profile is just so great and other natural mouthwashes I've tried have been so-so, so I may just continue to work with it for a while.",2
3,I've used just regular store bought tanning lotions and I feel like it works about the same. I do love that it comes with the mitt to rub it in so you don't have to get it on your hands. I enjoy using it for a little extra color.,2
3,The clip itself is of poor quality. It's sharp for a hair clip. But I bought it to use as decoration so that's ok. It came in an envelop so it was a bit squished.,2
3,I chose this product because I need to use gluten-free hair and body care products due to a gluten intolerance.  I also have an issue with strong fragrances whether it is from a chemical or natural scent. I was glad to be able to find this in the smaller sample size  bottles of this travel kit so I could try some of the gluten- free products without having to purchase full size bottles especially for something I have never used before.  I have only used the shampoo and conditioner so far and found them to be really moisturizing which is good for dry hair or during the colder months of the year. It would also be  great to re- moisturize the hair for those who color thier hair regularly.  During summer I only need to use about every other week. These products make it easy to get the comb through without much effort.  The only thing I did not like it that the scent was stronger than I usually like in a shampoo and conditioner and so I only use it periodically and not everyday. Thick and curly hair would love this product but fine hair may not need to use it everyday.,2
3,"For the most part, I'm loyal to Neutrogena skin care products.

And I usually use Neutrogrena moisturizer as well, though I use this one: [[ASIN:B000052YOX Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, Sensitive Skin, 4 Ounce]]. The Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion is similar to the moisturizer in that it's light, and it doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy after you apply it. It also holds in plenty of moisture, which I'm experienced with since I constantly have to re-apply weaker moisturizers in these bitter Chicago winters. It gets the job done. The only thing that keeps me from giving this product a higher rating is that it has a barely noticeable perfume-y scent that I don't really like. I don't like my face to be scented, and especially not my face lotion, since I have sensitive skin. If it were scent-less (and there's no mention of scent on the packaging, but trust me, it's there), I'd give it a 4. All in all, it'll get the job done, but if you don't like scented facial lotions, this one isn't for you.",2
3,"I got this in today and the four holes (none in the center) are very small, so if you use a product like Morning Star (as I do) then your incense won't fit in the holes. Also, it's slightly shabby looking, but overall it's not too bad for the price. It's a good weight.",2
3,Doesn't stay on as long as competing products.,2
3.0,I was trying to keep a shirt I like from falling and exposing my bra straps.  It's not the easiest tool to use.  I tried various ways to get it in the correct position.  Finally I got my husband to help me since he could see it better.  Not something I'd want to use everyday.,2
3,I received a Fusion Proglide from Gillette and I have found it a bit underwhelming.  I have traditionally use a Gillette Mach 3 for my shaving needs and love it.  The Proglide was a lot bigger and heavier.  The flex ball didn't seem to add anything to the shave.  It would actually hold more water in it and drip water when going from the sink to face.  I shave my head as well and this unit would clog so quickly that shaving was very tedious.  The blades are simply to close together for head shaving.  I was happy with the closeness of the shave.  If I had to shave everyday and only did my face I think I would have liked it a little more.  I will continue to use it on my face but I will stick with my trusty Mach 3 for my head.,2
3,impressed me. No erox aroma effect. Bottle is hard to hold and spray...however it looks modern and atractive on a table.,2
3,"This is not as great as I was hoping. My face feels like there is a film on it after I use it. Can't seem to get it mixed smoothly. For the price though, I can't really complain.",2
3,"long lasting, sweet, feminine fragrance",2
3,It works ok. Its a little rough on the skin and the plastic thing broke really fast. But other then that it works alright.,2
3,"I tried this moisturizer for a few weeks.  However, the product caused my sensitive skin to react, and I was forced to stop using the product and return it.<br /><br />As an alternative for those with sensitive skin, I would recommend Art of Shaving Eye Gel, which I have used for some time with no adverse reaction.<br /><br />This product moisturized well, but irritated sensitive skin.",2
3,I found it just average.  I can take it or leave it.  It is not one of my favorites.<br />Clarence,2
3,"I have used this gel pad on four 15 hour drives in a Lexus CT200H Hybrid(horrible factory seating),about 120 hours on my desk chair and I just love what this pad does for my back, legs and tailbone. I've had tailbone issues my whole life and 15 hour drives would usually result in a infection.<br />I'm giving it only 3 stars because of the price and the lack of a cover. I'd imagine this cost about a dollar twenty five to make and the lack of cover results in crumps, sand, anything and everything collecting inside. You cannot clean it. I am going to try and have someone custom make a cover for it. I recommend it to anyone sitting or taking long drives. FYI the gel pad also fit perfectly in my Honda Civic and Honda Element.",2
3,"Product works ok. Not the best detangling conditioner ever, but it gets the job done. I was not a fan of the fragrance. Overall, nothing &#34;wrong&#34; with the product but I won't choose it again.",2
3.0,"Its not my favorite moisturizer. I feel like it feels almost greasy, but I like the fact that it has SPF.",2
3,It just weighs down my bang and did not make it look any more flattering than it was originally. I barely use them now,2
3,"It was my first try , i was expecting  it would appear to be at least as great as Guess for Men but i was wrong, its ok though but cant come even close to Guess for Men, its my number one cologne",2
3,"Well I got my wig for a Megurine Luka Cosplay and it is NOT this bubble gum pink color, however I decided not to return it because the song I'm cosplaying (senbonzakura) she has a bit of a darker color.<br />This wig is almost fushia or perhaps even a light cranberry color. It is a high quality wig, however, and it is heat resistant. A few days after I got it I cut the bangs and straightened it and there was no burn smell or charred bits. However, I was a bit startled when I first opened the package. The wig looks blood red in the dark.",2
3,"Don't get me wrong I really like this product, however, it arrived and the light did not work.  I ordered it through gohastings.  It arrived very timely and they were willing to give me a refund if I wanted to ship it back.  I really did not want to wait for another one,  approx. 6-8 weeks, so I asked if they could send me one and I would return the one that I have in the envelope that they provide to me.  They were not willing to take a chance over an $8.99 product.  It seems that when I ordered it that I put my faith in them that they would deliver so I think that they should have put their faith in me that I would send the defective one back when the new one arrived.",2
3,Not quite up to my expectations and the TV ad for this product.  The fact that it was so inexpensive keeps it from being a total disappointment.,2
3,I was disappointed in these razors I thought they would be nicer because they are Gillette but they rust very fast. Literally one time use.,2
3,"The Panstik use to be larger and CHEAPER.  It is really too small for that much money. But, the service and the time period from Amazon was excellent. Thank you",2

3,"I've been using this toothpaste for over a year, as it was recommended by my dentist after a bout of gingivitis.<br />My boyfriend and I both switched at the same time, and the first night he was wondering what the long stringy white junk he was pulling out of his mouth was.<br />I don't have this peeling all of the time, but every couple of days, it happens, where you have to pull it out of your mouth.  It's quite disgusting.<br />I decided to look this up on the internet today and the first thing I seen when I typed in \\""Crest Pro Heath Gum Protection\\"" was \\""Side effects\\""... which I found odd.<br />Sure enough, there are hundreds of other people having the same things happen.<br />To those who are all upset because they think us who are \\""complaining\\"" are just \\""competitors\\"" well, we are not, we are simply expressing an issue that's occurring.<br />I like this toothpaste, as it's ridden my gingivitis, but I do get gum peeling which flat out sucks.<br />Lately I've started brushing twice a day and am noticing my mouth feels burnt and raw.  Last night I decided to skip my before bed brush because my mouth is feeling this way, and I said that I needed a break.  Thinking about this further, it's quite ridiculous to think you need a break from brushing your teeth.  This should not be happening.<br />I will likely keep using this toothpaste, until it possibly becomes painful, but I will be discussing this with my dentist and seeing what they have to say.",2
3,"I like this brush and it is the right size for drying and curling my hair.  It fits just right in my hand.  My only complaint is that it does not last long enough.  I have not had one of these last longer than 6 months.  Each one of these has broken off at the handle within six months of use.  I don't know if constant use with hot air with the hair drying or hitting the floor once in a while that causes the fracture.  The original one I had of these lasted forever, but the ones they are making now just don't last.  I still are my favorite brush to use and I buy several to have a spare when they break, but I would think that they shouldn't break this often.",2
3,Smile like sucks,2
3,The shears worked well the first couple of uses but dulled pretty quickly after that. I will spend more for a better pair next time.,2
3,I didn't realize when I bought it but this stuff is heavily scented with some synthetic fragrance.  I really wanted this to work but it makes me so nauseous to put on even the smallest amount. I definitely felt my skin tighten almost immediately after the first application but I dont think I'll be able to use this anymore.,2
3,Good.,2
3,Intense is an understatement.  I dyed my hair with this stuff and it was so black it looked fake.  I have a natural afro and this made it look like I had rubbed charcoal in my hair.  I didn't like it all!  Normally jet black looks really good on me.  This color did me no justice.  This is very extreme black.,2
3,"I bought this shampoo a few days ago and when i put it in my hair it felt like silk.  However, when I washed it out, all the shampoo washes down your back and it hurt my back with a cooling/burning feeling like the kind you get with frost-bite.  I don't know if my skin is sensitive or I'm allergic to a certain ingredient, because I'm not allergic to anything, really.  But, I gave this 3 stars because my hair was soft and healthy and it worked on my hair.  It has a great scent to it, also.",2
3,"Let me start by saying the seller was great and I received the toner with no problems.  The seller gets 5 stars.  As for the toner: I guess I'm asking too much of any anti-aging product.  I wanted some help for my melting face, but I may be beyond help.  My next option is to knot my scalp at the top back of my head.......",2
3.0,I've only used the product a couple times and I haven't seen much of a difference. Will update if anything changes!,2
3,great colors..they are just small..do not expect like a 6inch by 4 inch pallette its about 3 long and 2 wide max.<br /><br />if it wasnt so expensive it would be 5 stars,2
3,"I'd never tried Palmer's night cream, and was looking for something that was budget friendly.  I wish this had worked for me, as I love the soft scent and absorbent quality.  Unfortunately, my face broke out in a rash after I used it.  At first I thought it was a fluke, and stopped using it.  I tried several weeks later, and again broke into a rash after just  a few uses.  My skin usually isn't that sensitive.  I won't be buying again.",2
3,These decals are huge. I'm not a fan of the super long fake fingernails and that's what these are made for. I will have to cut them down to use them. I also ordered a different set (the white set) that was much more suitable for everyone's use. There are both larger and smaller stickers.,2
3,"Does work, but the rollers are quite hot so I leave them off the posts for a minute before putting them on my head.  It's okay, just not what I had expected.",2
3,Works fine for short term wear. I suck at putting lashes on so when I do get them on the glue works fine,2
3,"If you like the feeling of burning while tanning it works great. It gives a great color, but watch out when you get done tanning. It will burn for hours and itch a lot. It seems to give me a red color rather than a tan color. I tried it all over and it hurt so bad I said never again. I tried it again on my legs only since they are very hard to get any color. I burned and itched so bad it was hard to wait the 45 minutes to shower after. After the shower it still burns for a little while. I did give it 3 stars because if you like the burning and sizzling feeling while and after you tan it is great. But if you prefer to not feel like someone has poured hot grease on you after you tan then I wouldn't suggest using this product. I think the extreme itching was even worse than the burning. Put them together and it is torture.",2
3,"I ordered this with the assumption that it was vials, when I received it, to my surprise it was sachets. Although the products works well you are not getting what you paid for.",2
3,Like i said in the title it was ok the only complain i got it that it came without the cream cap.,2
3.0,I was not happy with the color and it doesn't stay on very long has to be reapplied way too often.,2
3,"I bought this mainly because I have an Xtava blow dryer which I really like.  I also liked that it was collapsible which makes it great for travel.  But after using it for a week I've concluded it will become my &#34;travel diffuser&#34; and not the one I use everyday.  It is not very sturdy and collapses easily when it's in use.  I prefer to get into my roots with it for extra lift but this closes right up once it hits my hair.  The main reason I give it 3 stars and not 5, it's difficult to put on the end of my Xtava blow dryer!  I have to use tweezers help it along.  The opening doesn't have much stretch so it's a bit of a project to get it in place.  I don't always diffuse my hair otherwise I'd just leave it on to avoid this.  So I will be purchasing an alternate diffuser for regular use and pack this away for trips.",2
3,"Not working so far after a few weeks.  My breakouts are worse.  I bought this for oily skin and my skin is worse than before.  Have to try something else. Sadly, this didn't work for me.  It kind of stinks too...something I would gladly put up with if it worked for me.",2
3,I choose this rating cause product its not really as described.  Color I picked was Medium brown and it looks like nlack color. Don't know if I will recommend.,2
3,"Yes, you do have to rub this in a little, but far less than applying traditional lotion and it it is absorbed quickly.  The quick absorption is probably because it isn't very moisturizing.  Pretty expensive considering the volume and moisturizing ability. I'd recommend you skip it and spend your money on something better.",2
3,I'm kind of disappointed in the price for a little bottle it could have been a little less in price but it's other than that it's okay.,2
3,"I have watched many reviews of this product on YouTube and everyone loves this red lipstick. The color is amazing and I believe any skin color can wear this red. It is a cool red and goes on very nicely, however, once it dries it really does stay on and won't come off, even when you want it to. It was really drying to my lips and I felt like I needed to keep licking them and applying the lip balm they provide you. At the end of the night it was so hard to get this stuff off and after rubbing my lips raw with soap and water and even some vasoline, I read on the label to use and oil based makeup remover. Well I didn't have that so it was a pain to get off. I gave it 3 stars due to it being really drying on the lips and very hard to take off at the end of the night. The color is really beautiful though.",2
3,"These is a set of 4 mini shimmer nail polishes. The polish was a little uneven on my nail and the brushes isn't that great. The white and dark pink only need one coat. I recommend a base coat and top coat. These aren't produced anymore though, so if you like them, you better stock up!",2
3,I like the amount and mixing condensity. The main concern I have is there was NO safety seal on this tube. I feel hesitant about using. It smells like seaweed but not sure why there would be no seal. Will need to contact customer service and hope for a replacement.,2
3,"This was exactly as expected, and garnered the reaction I had hoped to get when gifting it to a slutty friend.",2
3,"This left my hair a little too crunchy for my liking.<br />I received the Aussie Instant Freeze Hair Spray to test, but these are my opinions.",2
3,The feel pretty good. Realistic. Came quickly as well. Only thing is... There are air bubbles under the clear skin coating... Not sure why? I would probably rate them better if the bubbles weren't there.,2
3,"The color is pretty but its really thick. Not like the cheap watered down lip glosses. It does smell like clay though, but thats because Its all natural.  Lasts for about 1-2 hours, so youd have to keep reapplying.",2
3,"I had been using Style Edit when my beautician suggested this as a lower cost alternative.  It works as well as Style Edit, however, it does rub off on my pilllow cover.  This is not a big enough problem for me to stop using it, however.  I just use dark colored pillow covers.  It laundered out of the lighter pillow cover just fine.",2
3,The larger trimmer head works fine.  The unit has enough adjustments for length of hair.<br />Did not like the smaller trimmer blade.  It is nearly too small to really use for touchup and wants to get caught in my beard as I trim mustache with larger blade.,2
3.0,"I'v e heard many good things about this product.  It works ok for me but it DOES NOT have a pleasant smell.  I tend to lean to products that work and have a good smell.  If it had a better smell, I'm sure that it would be a staple for my hair.",2
3,I had an allergic reaction to it. But it was worth trying it out…… I got a full refund.,2
3,"Bought these for my wife as she wanted to try some to sleep on. They are comfortable but the packages we received (I bought this pack of 3) all stated they were white when in fact they were all pink. Certainly a very annoying difference since I would never have ordered them if I knew this. That being said, they are more comfortable than the cotton covers we used previously.",2
3,"I've mixed feelings about this product. For one thing, the powdery texture means spillage every time the brush is pulled out. This is an expensive product and I think it's shoddy work to not design it better. If it is a dry cluster of powder, why put it into a bottle with a narrow neck? Guaranteed to spill. On the other hand, once it is applied on my eyebrows, it stays until I take it off. I love that. So, hate the waste and clean up but love the color and staying power.",2
3,"its ok but if your looking to get dark use forever black it works so much better, year jwoww smell is great but it doesnt get you darker and i used the whole bottle and it didnt get me that much darker, with forever black i was darker in one session!!!!!!! i was so excited to try jwoww seeing as im a big fan of jersey shore but i was let down ;(",2
3,"This palette has a very good price.  You will think that this is a lip palette, isn't for me because is much more like gloss but the colors are intense.",2
3,These work as expected. :),2
3,"This is a berry fragrance with velvety floral undertones. It's pretty, but not super unique or long-lasting. The vial-shaped bottle is actually the best thing about it, but I wouldn't buy the perfume just for that reason.",2
3,"The lotion has a good smell. Make sure to wash your hands or you will get color in between fingers because this does have self tanner in it as well. I used it today in the salon and getting out of the bed, one of my legs were completely streaked sections missing color. You need to be real careful using this, I would rather buy a self tanner or use jergans natural glow due to that way color would be even. I rubbed in all the way and made sure and I forgot that this lotion streaks. Would try another brand next time. I bought this based on reviews and I have light skin but not again.",2

3,"I really wanted to love this stuff, but unfortunately it made me break out.  It's nice and lightweight, good pigment, works well for my under-eyes. Maybe it will work better for other skin types but for the acne-prone, I would not recommend.",2
3,I have used #53 Colgate Compact Head Soft Bristle that I bought at a Target store.  The toothbrushes I received were a slightly different shape and felt more like a medium bristle on my teeth.

3,"Well all the reviews I read about the instructions being impossible to understand were correct.They were comical. But I went on line and used the directions for the Derma Wand. I did not get any product to use with it, like some said they did but I just used my regular face lotion. I just got this today and used it twice. The wrinkles, or little bit of saggy skin I had on my chest, are gone. My skin is soft and smooth. I have jowls, baggy eyelid, and some lines around my mouth I am working on. I am thinking this is gonna work. I will write another review in a week or so. (day two) Having thought more about this, it's common knowledge that at my age 61, once skin is stretched it does not bounce back. Some of the ways to use this involve a lot of skin stretching, especially around the eye area. Now, it looks great at time of doing it, but next morning all wrinkles were back in eye area with it seems to a me a few more. Ok I only used it one day, but I have decided to just roll it all over my face even upper eye for a few weeks with NO stretching of the skin just to see what it does. I feel like once you start stretching the skin you will HAVE to use this forever. I also recommend being hydrated when using it as enough water fills in some of our fine lines and there won't be as much need for all the stretching. Any comments on this I would love to hear!( Going back to some facial exercises also)",2
3,"Kind of light but ifd you use it everyday it may do the trick for you as it does me. The Wahl groomer is much better but the you have to replace the heads too often. A better product may be coming soon, I hope.",2

It comes in a tin or metal type tube (to help preserve it, I guess) Even though I shake it up, the first thing that comes out of the tube each time is oil or water, some kind of liquid, almost likes its melted or separated? I'm not unhappy with the results, but it is incredibly oily, probably better for those with dry skin or usage in dry winter months.

3.0,"This is an okay product.  You really have to shake it really well in order to mix the ingredients.  The consistency is very different than other serums; it's much more fluid.  I gave it a three starts because it is all natural which is a great plus to me. I only use natural skin products, and this one has similar effects than other ones.  It is not bad, but not better than other products I use.",2
3,"I purchased this product based on reviews despite my initial reservation about the permanent applicator. I didn't like the fact that I couldn't remove it and wash it but it is supposed to have antimicrobial properties. Rubbing the foundation around on the face, despite a little or a lot, does not create a finished look. I always saw makeup line streaks which I felt compelled to get rid of with a hand-held spong applicator, so the process of applying with that little soft applicator didn't save any time or effort. The foundation, once applied, did not look any better or worse than other brands I've tried. I found the coverage to be fine/enough with repeated swipes.<br /><br />I do not wear foundation every day, and because after several months I was not able to remove the applicator to wash (I don't care about the antimicrobial properties, I am someone who wants to wash any bateria or debris off), I decided to try another product from a different line with which I am extremely happy.",2
3,This product was ok... It's not as rough as I had hoped... And if you get it wet it's EVEN WORSE... It just smoothes right out and doesnt remove any dead skin.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy it again unless there was NOTHING ELSE AVAILABLE... it's ok... not great... not bad either... Just OK.<br /><br />IT'S NOT what I was expecting.,2

3,"This product worked as intended, and lasted quite a while on my toenails. I would have given it 5 stars except that the color of one of the sheets (which were supposed to be a black and white design) was yellowed from some sort of exposure.  I could immediately tell with it still in the package that the white looked yellowed, but when I took both sheets of \\""polish\\"" out of the package and compared them<br />side by side you could really tell the top (exposed) sheet had some discoloration. Obviously I still used the product, but I feel like this issue was pretty noticeable and probably shouldn't have been sent to me in that condition to begin with.",2
3,I have only used it a few times but the comments of thick and stringy definitely make it almost impossible to pump it out. Not to fond of that,2
3.0,"Before purchasing Skin Whitening by Rozge, I did some research, but found minimal reviews on its effectiveness.  So I took a chance because the price was super reasonable and it had most of the ingredients that more expensive products contain.  I have been using the product, day and night, on all the dark spots on my face that I thought were formed from sun exposure. After washing my face, I spot treated the areas, then waited at least 5 minutes before applying facial lotion (SPF if it was the morning).  This gives the product time to absorb into the skin.  I also exfoliated my face every other day and applied a face mask (a pumpkin enzyme 10 minute mask) once a week.  At first, nothing was happening- but after speaking to a registered nurse, who works for a dermatologist, she said that it takes time and as long as it had Hydroquinone (2%, which is the max that is allowed that is without a prescription) then it should have some effect.  After a month (as the product indicates) I finally saw results! As with all products, results varies depending on how your skin reacts to the chemicals- some people don't have results while others do.  I am really pleased with the results of Rozge's product! I gave this product three stars because it didn't get rid of all the spots, but it did take away the clusters of darkened areas that were pretty noticable.<br />I hope this review was informative and helpful.  Good luck in your search  for a whitening product!",2
3,Rollers get too hot against my scalp. Not sure if it's because of inadequate barrel cover or what. Didn't like the large clips to hold rollers on. They left 'crimp' marks in my hair as they didn't hold tight enough to my scalp.,2
3,"I liked the idea, but it seemed dried out.",2
3,"The smell is great, it's not greasy. I don't know if I can say I love it for my hair, its not giving me the shine and feel I was looking for and it arrived in an opened / damaged box.",2
3,the smell is so over powering eve if you only use a couple of drops I haven't really noticed that it is actually helping my itchy scalp sooo I will do a updated review after a couple of more uses,2
3,"you can work with it, it looks good, but not very comfortable, it's not holding hair, not staying firm in one place ....",2
3,I may not have used it long enough and I may be a bit past the  age for this product to be effective but I shaved my head and embraced the baldness! LOL!,2
3,A bed side helper like this was the single most useful tool my brother Bill got for me after I caught a heavy duty stroke one year ago. I was visiting at Bill's house. I ordered this one for a senior lady here; fresh out of surgery with a laminectomy. I know it will help . I have not installed it yet so quality wise I can not yet say. Maybe later. So I unfairly gave it 3 stars...it may deserve more. And thanks I am 80% better from the stroke.,2
3,"I have thick hair and bought this hoping I could twist my hair up, but it doesn't hold it.  It's fine to use as a clip.",2
3.0,smelly but it dries the surface of the nail.,2
3.0,"I like this product, however, prior to the repackaging I didn't notice a &#34;greasy&#34; feel to my hair.  With this new line, I don't like how it makes my hair look like it needs to be washed again.  So, I don't use it as often.  I have fine hair, but a lot of it.  My hair and skin are naturally on the oily side, so I need a product that doesn't add to oils.  I would think about trying a different product than this in the future for a heat protectant for these reasons.",2
3,"JUST LIKE THE FOUNDATION I DONT REALLY LIKE THIS PRIMER .. IM PALE AND IT LEAVES MY FACE EVEN WHITER .. ITS KINDA THICK , BUT I GUESS ITS AN OKAY PRODUCT.. YOU CAN FIND BETTER",2
3,I'm allergic to something in this product.,2
3,Im not sure whether this product works or not. But the smallest one hurts me when i touch it on my face.,2
3,"I used this shampoo for my dark brown hair that I am letting go grey. It doesn't really do anything to my hair at this point, so I will save it until I get more grey hair.",2
3,"There has been a design/manufacturing change in the black plastic retainer that holds the flex screens. The head assembly will not stay in place when the shaver is running. It is fairly simple to remove the 3 individual screens from the old retainer and replace them with the screens from the new retainer, just be sure not to discard the old black plastic retainer.",2
3.0,"I have problems with mobility and found this difficult to hold on to and awkward to reach with.  I think that I did some more searching, a better product could be found.  The handle is slippery and angles, so it is hard to keep it from flipping over.",2
3,nice can work with it if i get the right lashes,2
3,I  realized it was wrong product for what i wanted to do. i wanted different type of facial clay. returned with full satisfaction,2
3,"There were 46, NOT 48 tubes in the container. Of the variety of flavors, 21 were cherry, 10 were regular, 6 were mint, 5 were bubblegum, and only 4 were vanilla. This is quite disappointing for us!  We expected an accurate count and we expected equal amounts of each flavor.",2
3,"A little small, good price compared to other brands. A little on the weak side for durability. Seems to be fraying a bit already and its been only 2 weeks. I keep it out of the shower when not in use, and only used by one person once a day.",2
3,"I love the water pik idea, but it is a bit loud. I definitly makes me &#34;floss&#34; more often than I normally do.",2
3,Sheds a little too much for me.,2
3.0,"So far I have noticed my skin looking more fresh, more vibrant.  I have combination skin so I was hesitant to use this, especially during the summer months.  I do feel like it somewhat melts off my face in the heat and humidity so I have been using it only at night.  I like the smell, it doesn't mess my skin up (it's sensitive).  My husband says my face feels incredibly soft. ETA:  I cannot use this in the summer..  It clogs my skin and causes massive breakouts.  I have tried using it only in areas where I am dry but when it's 110 degrees outside, that might be hard.",2
3,"This dusting powder wasn't everything I expected it to be. It smelled rather \\""grandmotherish\\"". But after using it a few times the scent is growing on me and I'm using it more. I'm actually starting to like it.<br /><br />Update:  I have been using this for a while now and I have had SUCH a change of heart!  I love this scent!  I just recently bought the All That Jasmine bath bomb which has the same Jasmine scent and it left my bathroom smelling delicious for days!  I had company visit me for a week and the wife kept asking me what in my bathroom smells so good.  She kept saying she could spend all of her time in there and wants her bathroom to smell like that.  It really does smell so good.<br /><br />The Silky Underwear after the All That Jasmine bath bomb will leave you smelling great for hours.  I only wish LUSH made a body cream or lotion in this scent.",2
3,I find that it did reduce the redness but did not heal my skin problem.  Must use daily to see reduced redness.,2
3,"everything  fine but razor does not shave the neck very close, Takes a while .over and over",2
3.0,"This product, as useful as it may seem, dries out my hair as much as the shampoo.  I've since turned to a different conditioner that makes my hair silky soft without being heavy.",2
3,The casing for the Apivita Lip Care products feels very cheap.  This is a nice enough lip balm but I did not find it moisturizing enough for my tastes and the color pay off was next to nothing.,2
3,Haven't noticed any visible change after using this product.  Was hoping for more of a visible change.  Moisturized well however.,2
3,they were larger than i thought,2
3,very good,2
3.0,Dont use as a belt it doesn't hold on but makes a great neclace,2
3,Came earlier than expected. Colors are beautiful..although a few of them were broken. :(,2
3.0,Not  strong enough I didn't feel the difference.,2
3,"This is a great product but my disappointments are:  Expensive compared to alternates, doesn't have a Patchouli scent after applied, requires mixing.  The last point is not a boig deal but new buyers should know.  I didn't want a strong smelling deodorant and this isn't.  It does seem to give lasting coverage and holds up to persperation.  Overall I do like product but cost is high when you include the mandatory $12 shipping which is very high based on size / weight of the product.  I'll see how long it lasts.",2
3,It smells good and does the work.,2
3,"When I first opened the lemon oil, the scent seemed quite strong. But after adding it to an unscented coconut carrier oil the lemon scent was hardly noticible. It disappeared almost immediately when I used the blend on my skin. I was hoping for a light citrus scent but got nothing even after adding a whole lot of additional lemon oil. As other customers have stated, the dropper that comes with it, tucked up inside the cap, doesn't fit the bottle. I had to order pipettes. Very disappointed.",2
3,"it didnt cover as much and wore off quick. get the corrector instead, it stays stronger. great for ballet classes though.",2
3,"I owned the previous iteration of this shaver system, I think it was the top of the line 360 Complete #8995, for about 10 years until the base station died and I decided to upgrade the full set, rather than just replacing the base station.<br /><br />This one does have some interesting new features including a more ergonomic grip, better battery charge and cleaning indicators, and a variable 3-speed design while maintaining compatibility with the same cleaning cartridges I already stocked.<br /><br />Unfortunately, however, this model seems to be very finnicky about being perfectly perpendicular to your face at all times, whereas the previous one was quite a bit more forgiving. This one, brand new with a pristine cutting foil, likes to grab and painfully tear at hairs near the edges of the foil in a way the previous model would never do. Very painfully, in fact. It's taking some getting used to. Other than that, it's a fine shaver.",2
3,These were my first experience with rollers so for 1 it took a few days to really learn how to use them but once you get the hang of it they're cool. The good thing is they're so soft it's for the most part really comfy to sleep in. The bad thing is they get caught in your hair a lot because of the snaps and sometimes it will pull throughout the night even if you try to fix it. They don't have much grip so if your hair is really soft or has layers they fall out sometimes. Also because its not a lot of grip it's hard to roll the crown of your head they don't stay up. But they're good for thicker longer hair. I like flexi Rods way better!,2
3,the last few cans i've bought dispense the gel like a foam.  it spits it out with a lot of air.  when i first used it years ago it came out as a blue gel...now it comes out as a very light blue foam.  i'm becoming less enthused about it every time i shave.,2
3,"Meh, this was just ok and the bottle could have lasted longer. Wasn't bad at all, I just expected a lot from the brand because they are awesome. The volumizing foam is wonderful for my curls, this cream is just so so. So give them both a try (at different times) and see which you like best:)",2
3.0,"The hairbrush delivered is completely different than pictured!  The body of the brush where the bristles are is flimsy in comparison to the brush pictured, and black instead of blue... there is a short section of gray, or silver color, plastic leading to a smooth black pointy handle, rather than a handle as pictured!<br />I have several Vidal Sassoon brushes identical to the brush pictured, but as they are fairly old and have become rather worn I had hoped to get a replacement to match the brushes I have!<br />Had the brush I ordered been as pictured, I undoubtably would have ordered additional brushes as I love this brush!<br />Would recommend correcting your picture to reflect the actual product furnished!<br />This is the first time I have been disappointed with an Amazon purchase!!  Sincerely,  Earl Steiding",2
3,"I like this better that the matte sumotec.  It is a little lighter and has some shine to it.  It smells pretty nice.  It still tends to weigh my hair down.  It also feels sort of sticky.  It is a very fine balance between too much and too little.  The jar will last forever.  My hair dresser loves this so maybe it is just me...  If it seems like it is drying out, zap it with your hair dryer,  it will loosen up!",2
3.0,It looks beautiful in day one. It will start to peel off the very next day...,2
3,"I give it three star because it's really being over priced, you can get a way better brush at this price. Yes, it's a nice sponge, it works like miracle, but it doesn't worth it. If you watch Youtube and do a little bit research on prive labeling you will know what I'm talking about.",2
3,I like the item it took like two weeks but it was worth it.,2
3,"Nice color but not very complementary to my skin tone, looks lighter in person.",2
3.0,Love Sebastian  products.  This smells awesome ... But the hold is not as strong  as I would  like.  It's  ok.,2
3,"I have pretty significant psoriasis. This product was thin and needed thick application to see little, if any result. Perhaps it would work best on only mild cases.",2
3,"Bathmats are nice... Curtain and liner ? Flimsy, paper thin... :(<br />I used mats anyways but had to buy another curtain.",2
3,"First of all it did not come with instructions. Trying to remove the appratus after the peircing was difficult and a bit painful. It was easier removing the second time because you now knew how to take it off. Second, it took at least two attempts before it pierced the ear all the way through. Third, I do not believe you can do it yourself. I had my adult niece do it for me because I knew she would not hesitate and give it all she had, and she had trouble.",2
3,The two blade razors made by Gillette gave a much more comfortable shave than this razor.,2
3,I love Estée Lauder and this color but I only gave this lipstick 3 stars because it did not hold the color to long I ran out of it faster then I do with any others.,2
3,"In general this product does work.  BUT potential skin rashes, bad smell, and taking longer to apply than just shaving.  I went back to shaving right away.  Tested an area on my arm for 3 weeks.  No noticable reduced hair regrowth.",2
3,"I ordered this because I needed some body wash, and this was such a great price. It works well and lathers up well, but the smell isn't really what I thought. I expected a floral, girly scent, but this almost has a masculine smell. My husband agrees. It's okay for the price",2
3.0,"Having read lots of good stuff about Rosehip oil I decided to give it a go within my beauty routine. I have a genrous ration of stretchmarks from having my babies, scars from surgery, and have less-than-happily welcomed wrinkles in the past couple of years. It sounded like I might have found a cure for that trio but I'll admit my experience didn't leave me wowed.<br /><br />Firstly, you've got to get used to the smell. I was horrified when I first received it, not having anticipated just how pungent and unpleasant it would be. But honestly, it only took about three uses to adjust and once you begin working it into your skin that initial fishy funk turns earthy and pleasant. I've actually grown fond of it. Unfortunately for me, I can't use it on my face. Just a couple of days and I had one of the worst breakouts I've had in years. Reading other reviews I'm wondering why I hit the pimple jackpot with it and may go ahead and suck it up to try it again on my face but yeesh it was bad.<br /><br />As a moisturizer I did like it a lot for the scars and my poor marked up belly but I noticed no reduction in either in the month I've used it. Now that my initial testing period for review is over I might swap to using it on my hands to keep them looking young because I did like it in general.<br /><br />Note: I received a complimentary product in exchange for an honest review.",2
3,"with it having so many needles so close together the needles dont want to poke into skin, It takes alot of pressure to work right then<br />Im sore. I will one that doesnt have the needles so close next time",2
3,"I thought smell will stay longer. I was expecting different smell. Could be one of your choice. Puppy react fine,",2
3,The smell of the cologne is very nice and the bottle come as picture except for the size... Its small,2
3,"weird smell, and the bottle is kinda flamboyant plus I haven't really found it too moisturizing or darkening. I know it's not a bronzer but it makes no difference if I tan with this stuff or anything else.",2
3,"I ordered the Hoola and Dallas from different sellers.. I am not sure which I recieved today.. I am too caught up in my disappointment with Benefit cosmetics, to charge so much for a small box with msybe 1/4 -1/3 of it only product. Shame on them. I put it down and didn't even try it, so I can't even say I like the product or not. I went anout enjoying my other products that came today. But I have nothing bad to say about the seller. They have done their job, and speedy delivery!!",2
3,it kinda look different than the picture and looks not very clean white but still cute though,2
3,They don't look like the picture. But aren't too bad looking on. They are very dramatic looking and don't plan on getting from the same brand. But service getting them was great and on time.,2
3,"Full disclaimer: I received a free product sample directly from Gillette to use and review.<br /><br />I gave this razor a shot, and while it does a good job of getting all the hairs, and its mobility around my face is one of the best I've experienced so far, it just isn't for me. It still makes a difficult transition for someone used to almost exclusively electric razors. I just don't like how these types of razors feel on my face as a whole, and I doubt I can ever get over that. While it isn't something i'd personally get again, I will say that for what it is, any fan of these razors would find it quite well. It gripped comfortably in my hand, the weight felt just right as I held it, and price wise, its pretty affordable.",2
3,"its Okay...i thought the perfume would have a more coconutty smell to it...thats what i was looking for..it wasnt bad, though. I dont regret buying it but may not buy it again",2
3,"This powder has shimmer in it which I was not looking for. I wanted a matte powder. Other than that, no issues with it at all.",2
3,"I, unfortunately,once again believed the pictures. I need to learn to read everything. In this case, it's my own fault, it says you'll get two kits with pink, red, blue, green, red and white. NOT what she picture shows. I'll probably give one of these away.",2
3,"Alot larger than I would have liked.  Otherwise, its very pretty.",2
3,"This product worked while I was using it, but 2 days later after finishing it I start again with that awful itching feeling. I'm not pretty convinced about the efficacy of this product. I have used it like 3 different times, and it's been the same. I have tried everything from creams to pills over the counter to prescribed creams, and some of them made my vaginal infection get worst. Right now, I'm taking Ultimate Flora Vaginal support plus I'm inserting one capsule of Femdophilus for 9 days. Let's see how this works.",2
3,"I bought this for the groomer and the groomer works great. The razor is nothing special, it feels nicer shaving against the grain but the overall shave is no better than my Schick Hydro. With the cost of a replacement shave head it's worth it to stick with your razor. There was a 5 dollar coupon that brought the price down to around 12 bucks. I'll pay that for a decent beard/mustache groomer anyway. I'll use the razor until it's dull and then forget about that part.",2
3,"I used Revitalash for six months.  It took awhile to notice a difference, but my lashes were definitely thicker and longer.  Then I developed a sensitivity to it.  My eyes swelled up, reddened and itched like crazy.  I discontinued the product for several weeks hoping it was something else that caused the problem.  But after one more application, there was no way I could continue using it.  Again, my eyes puffed up and itched.  My eyes are paramount, so I will not ever use it again.  Too bad for me!",2
3,These don't pull any hair out but I use them for applying my false lashes. I needed some tweezers just to hold the lashes when I put them on. Other than that....they don't close right so I won't be tweezing any eyebrows out with these. They weren't bought for tweezing anyway. For that I have to spend a lot more.,2
3,"i bought this for the novelty of it, i remember growing up seeing the last few of the burma shave signs along peoples farms, i think it was well after burma shave was gone. so i bought this just to see, honestly i like the set, but using shave soap just isnt for me, i like my gillette better",2
3,"I love Butterfly Flower, but this lotion is a little too glittery for me. There's tons of glitter in it. I expected it to be a little shimmery but I feel like the amount of glitter is just way too much, and I can't wear it normally because it just looks ridiculous and gets glitter on everything.  This could be my fault though, I ordered it online without ever actually seeing what \\""radiant silk lotion\\"" was in the actual store.",2
3,"I use to buy this brand and color from the local beauty supply store and many of the stores I would purchase it stop carrying it.  I liked the lipstick because it was long wearing and would stay on all day.  For reason, that is no longer the case.  I am not sure if the product changed or what.  I still like the color though.",2
3.0,They look cheap but they are working fine so far. They are too long to fit in most compacts.,2
3,"Yeah, this product is not what it is all worked up to be. Not really getting anywhere with this. I have been so much darker before with other tanning lotions. It leaves your hands orange and it is really hard to get off. What I would suggest doing is to going tanning every other day, use this stuff one day and the other day use a tanning accelerator. That is what helped me with this stuff to max out its potential.",2
3,"I have tried almost ever HEM brand incense and love them all, but this one is ranked way low on my list; albeit still good. The problem is that it is not patchouli but very piney with a hint of musk to it. Still nice especially for the price.",2
3,Will not shave close is used everyday. When used on beard the foil didn't last 2 weeks.Worked best for me if used every other day..,2
3,Its shampoo. It makes my hair shiny. Why am I even writing this? I did it to make the emails STOP.,2

3,"Product claims Avon &#34;Naturals&#34; on the bottle....it is so not natural, that I am struggling to figure out how they figured to post &#34;Natural&#34; on the product. Maybe they meant that the scent of vanilla was a &#34;natural&#34; scent? Anyways, the vanilla smells very nice, but there is nothing natural, at all, about this product. Screams false advertising to me.",2
3,"I really should know better. You never buy anything that claims it takes care of all your needs. I really was in the market for a new beard trimmer as my old Norelco had finally died.  I had also planned to buy on of the more expensive self-cleaning Braun's later on. But I saw this and thought I would kill two birds with one stone. No such luck, the shaver part works great and am very happy with it (but would have rather had the self-cleaning model) The beard trimmer part does not work that well. Took several passes to trim my beard evenly, and if your going for that stubble look it does not trim close enough. Even my 6-year-old Norelco took only one pass. I will use this as my primary razor for a few months till I can afford to buy the more expensive self-cleaning model. Then use this as my travel razor as it is one unit to pack instead of 2.  <br /> <br />Save the money and buy a sole beard trimmer and a sole shaver. You will be much happier and feel less taken by marketing.",2
3,I can't say i really see any difference in peoples aproach to me with this product. It does smell nice though.,2
3.0,"The first delivery had to be returned as the hand held device was defective; the on and off switch was not functional.  You could not move the button.  The machine was returned and the new one, although a bit better, still has a problem with the on and off button on the hand held device.  The button is rather stiff and not easy to move back and forth.  For something that has had such a high consumer rating, how is it that I've had this difficulty?  (Will use it for a while to see if the button travel improves.  If not, will return the Waterpik to Amazon)",2
3,"It works well, but I don't care for the aroma.",2
3,"I have shoulder length hair and I have difficulty getting this product to lather throughout my entire head - even though I try to focus on mainly the scalp area.  I also dislike the &#34;mud-like&#34; smell of this product.  After I wash, my hair feels like there's a film on it and my hair tangles significantly, I have to use conditioners to soften, de-tangle and prevent further tangling after washing and drying.",2
3,"Too small for adult size heads. Would fit a young child. Nice product, though.",2
3,Very cute and all but this works best for about at the longest a little over shoulder length. My hair goes to the middle of my torso and it only curled my upper layers which are shorter well. Otherwise I think it'd be best to get more than 6 also because even with slightly thin hair i ended up having to grab larger locks of hair together to prevent it from falling out but then it wouldn't curl as well. It's best to use them properly which you can look up online but basically you wrap your hair in the roller and then you have to twist the roller or else it'll just fall out.,2
3,"I'm a little capricious when it comes to makeup remover products.  I figure once I try enough of them, I'll settle on a trusted favorite.  It probably won't be these, though.<br /><br />At first, I wondered why the other reviewers were complaining about burning/stinging sensations in the eyes.  I used these to remove eyeshadow and waterproof mascara and they did a good job, even though I've had trouble removing this mascara with other products in the past.  (I did have to use one pad per eye.)<br /><br />So anyway, I took my eye makeup off and everything was good.  A minute or two later, though, my eyes started burning.  I have no idea what was going on with the delayed effect.  I did get in the shower right afterwards, so I was able to wash my face pretty thoroughly.  It actually wasn't the worst burning I've ever had from eye makeup remover, but it wasn't fun.  If you have sensitive eyes, you might want to skip these.<br /><br />These do have a lovely (cucumber) smell.  They're moist without being drippy-wet, so they'd probably work for travel (although the container is somewhat large).  If you don't have sensitive eyes, you might want to give these a try.",2

3,"Liked the feel, although my daughter/daughter in law did not...felt like &#34;jelly&#34; on their feet.  Big issue is if you walk around the house, they collect dirt of course.  They don't seem to come clean very well with hand washing...which is what you have to do.",2

3,"Don't trust the swatches in the store!!!! I wanted to switch to this brand from Clairol Soyplex 6AA.  The sales clerk/cosmatologist told me I couldn't expect 6A to be a universal hue, rather I had to find the swatch that matched Clairol's 6AA swatch.  Well, that was a 7 in this line.  I ended up going with the MG (master grey coverage) since that was one reason I was trying a different brand (Clairol seemed to &#34;wash off&#34; the grey strands pretty quickly).  Anyway, I shouldn't have listened as my hair is definitely a 7 (just like my daughters 7N Clairol) rather than being comparable to 6AA and this is before I have even washed it. for the first time.  Oh well, hopefully I can save someone else from making the same mistake.",2
3,"It has been the best non RX I've tried, however, the spot on the forehead is pretty big and still there.  I can't complain for the price.  It has worked fairly well so I would give it a try if the age spots are carmel colored.  Mine is a lot darker so need professional treatment of some kind.",2
3,Got this along with the shampoo and it seems like this is not needed.  It doesn't seem to do anything to help beyond simply using the shampoo.  Plus it also gets kind of foamy when you work it in after application and it leaves your hair a little greasy-looking.,2

3,I have used this product for about 2 years now and loved it.  Recently I bought a new bottle it had a different package but promised the same result.  It defiantly is has more smooth but now I look like a ghost.  I have this white film that doesn't rub off so well.  I am going to try the Blue Lizard.,2
3.0,"Very nice brush for dry hair, does terrible on wet hair. It does feel great for a touch up or end of day brush out. Feels great on scalp, I do love that part!",2
3,"I received this product along with the concealer, blush and corrector via [...].  I was so excited to get to try out the line and loved that it contained Olay. Loved even more that it was free to try!      Big disappointment.  The foundation is thick, cake-like and doesn't appear to have any additional benefits of any sort of moisturizer-like feature.  I can say that it covers well and I love the concealer!  Just don't care for the thick, heavy feel of it.  Mixed feelings since it DOES cover well, but admit that it's not too much more than that.  At this point, I'd say average.",2
3.0,"Didn't work for me. I'm 5'7 140 lbs, just have a bit of a baby belly. Was hoping for something that could help along with diet and exercise for the summer. Maybe my fat cells don't need detoxing???",2
3,"Looks lovely, easily applied, but it doesn't last for long.. I tried a black one and it looked good for no longer than 5 hours",2
3,will not know how well the product worked until I use it for a while longer. It seems to be effective so far.,2
3.0,It's a Very nice brush but doesn't work well with liquid foundation :( still on the search for a good one .,2
3.0,The nails are super cute but both things of nail glue were dried up.,2
3,Brushes shed a bit. Pretty much get what you pay for.,2
3,The trimmer works okay.  Price is right.  It doesn't burn through batteries.  I would probably buy a more expensive version next time.,2
3,personally not really excited with this razor. I have had cheaper razors that were actually better. Personally I would not buy this shaver again.,2
3,"I bought this recently while traveling after reading the reviews and thought that I'd give it a try. I actually bought the smaller tube and I'm glad I did. I was in the heavy winter cold when I used it and it did seem to help my skin a bit, but I was also using other products to help my skin battle the weather; so not sure this solely did the trick. It is a nice cream that spreads and absorbs very well, but the problem is that the smell is pretty strong. I put it on at night and literally had to go wipe it off my face so I could breathe. I stuck to using it only in the day and my face still smelled for a while after I put it on. Perhaps I have a sensitive nose but if you think that is a possibility for you, skip this one.",2
3,"I'm a real fan of the Olay Moisturinse In-Shower Body Lotion w/ shea butter, which is becoming really hard to find in stores. I ordered this to give it a shot, since it had mineral oil as an ingredient that the other lotion does not.<br /><br />Goes on great in the shower however it felt more sticky than smooth after getting out of the shower. Not in a really bad way, just different from the other product. I will probably stay with the shea butter version - when I can find it! Hopefully it will remain available on Amazon for awhile.",2
3,"I read a review when looking at this product from a woman who had the gastric bypass surgery (as did I). I don't want to sound indelicate, but people who are looking at this product all have the same problem, so I'm going to be blunt.  One of the side effects of gastric bypass surgery is a loose stool that has a strong odor. I am so self-conscious of this side effect, that I rarely allow myself to use a public restroom; but sometimes you just don't have a choice.  After seeing someone I know walk into the stall I had just vacated, and walk back out and enter another stall, I was so embarrassed that I was determined to find something to counteract the problem.  I found this product and decided to give it a try.  I got the 3-piece set (intending to use the small, travel atomizer for work). The small, travel atomizer I don't like at all.  It didn't spray properly and I ended up with the liquid all over my hand.  Also I had to use my thumb to make it spray at all.  It also isn't refillable, which I thought was stupid.  The product itself, however, works pretty well.  I have to use the maximum sprays (I said my bowel odor is strong), but it works well.  It leaves a nice citrusy scent.  I recommend this product for anyone with the embarrassing problem of strong bathroom odors. I only gave three stars because of my disappointment with the travel atomizer.  Otherwise, I'd give it 4 stars.",2
3,It doesn't smell entirely like the actual perfume.  Sometimes it smells just like it and then sometimes it smells like plain rubbing alcohol,2
3,It was okay just okay,2
3,WORKS ABOUT LIKE OTHERS FOR SALE.  HAVE YET TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WORKS AND THAT YOU CAN AFFORD SO WILL PROBABLY NOT REORDER,2
3,"I got this a year back...and its pretty handy till now...Be cautious it become super hot very soon & so hot it hurts your finger at times....My hair is not all so curly...its kinda wavy at the roots..and just rush through the straightener very fast...at times 2 or 3 stokes for a 1 bunch of hair...and go around like 8 - 10 bunches as whole for my hair. Its stylish...I carry it outdoors...after use it cools down pretty fast as well...say 5 mins...it doesn't make your hair so dry like some other straighteners, but still it leaves some dryness in hair.",2
3,"This goes on looking purple and is not flattering to my complexion.  Its winter though, so maybe with some color on my face, it'll look better",2
3,Great product but its a little too tan for me the description said translucent i hope it works in the winter when I'm not so tan,2
3,"Im still hopeful that it will do its job. not giving up just yet , it feels good smells good, but my problem is still there. only time will tell.",2
3.0,Not my favorite mascara,2
3,"Well i have fine brittle hair, and i bought this in the hopes of making my hair a little more thicker. the cream doesn't leave a sticky residue which is what i like, but the results were just \\""blah\\"". I loved the smell of the cream that was my favorite part. i used it for  whole month and it didn't do much for my hair, i do admit it gave me HUGE  volume, but its till made my hair, feel strange, not soft but kinda like frozen. maybe i had to much high expectations, on it, but if i order again it will because i will be using the cream as a voluminizer for my hair, not a thickner.<br /><br />i started taking biotin vitamins that is what is helping make my hair thicker :]<br /><br />most likely wont order this again, it is a little to pricey fro me...",2
3,I had to buy 2 sets on them .. because it wasnt enough so if your an A cup like me i would recommend you getting 2 sets,2
3,"This Primer is Claire and colorless. It goes on smoothly and yes it does give the skin of your face a very nice silky feel. As for keeping your face oil free with the make up , not entirely. But I find that I do shine a lot less so it is working to some extent.<br /><br />Update: This product made me break out so badly!! it took 2 weeks to clear-up once I stop using it!!",2
3,"Tool is does not seem to be properly aligned. When you close the nipper, the top tips touch, but there is still a space at the bottom. When used on fingers, this amounts to cuticle being cut on one end, and the other end simply being pulled or marked. lightweight and pretty design.",2
3,"The system works fine...the only problem I have with it is the brush. It has some (only a few) bristles that are not so soft...I intend to trim those back and see how it goes. The price is certainly good. I bought it because my trip was extended, and I had left my system at home (not a good way to save luggage weight!). Over all a good product.",2
3,"I have to say, I'm not terribly impressed with \\""That Gal\\"" as a brightener. As a primer, I guess it's OK, but I don't see that much difference between \\""with\\"" and \\""without.\\"" I got this product because of its supposed brightening effect. Again, I don't see much difference between the before and after. It's very pink coming out of the tube, but the color seems to disappear completely when I put it on my face. I used a gift card to buy this--I'm glad I didn't actually spend my own money on it, because I would have been REALLY disappointed. (For what it's worth, I've liked every other Benefit product I've tried.)",2
3,"This one works somehow, not perfectly. If the size is little bigger it will be better. Hopefully they can make the improvement.",2
3,The smell was not what I really expected. I was looking for a change  in perfumes and  I still prefer Lalique perfume,2
3,"This is a good small flat iron.  It heats up well and I was able to straighten my frizz well - however to make curls with it, it doesn't work as well.  Still good - just not excellent.  You get what you pay for!",2
3,"The pictures of this item do not do it justice. It is absolutely beautiful. My only issue with it is that it is already starting to lose its color on the tips of the hair stick, after only a few days of use.",2
3,"I really like the way my lashes look with this mascara.  The mascara separates and elongates.  However, the mascara does clump a bit.  You definitely need a brow brush to fix after application.  It seems to be better now that I have been using a few weeks - the clumping was really bad on the new wand.  Not sure I would buy again - the lashes look good, but I hate the extra time after applying as I am often in a rush.",2
3,I'm not crazy about this product as it makes you look kind of orange-better put on regular bronzer not worth the price,2
3,"It really isn't a scrub, it has very few scrubbing particles. It is really just an okay cleanser. If you want a scrub, try St. Ives Apricot scrub.",2
3,"i wanted an eyeliner that didn't smudge so i bought this.  well, maybe i expected too much.  It does a little better job than other eyeliners of staying put but it still does smudge...  also, this doesn't work on the waterline :/ and it isn't very smooth.    But it is pigmented, easy to apply, and as I said, it does stay longer than other eyeliners  and it doesn't smudge as much.  I heard that the liquid version of this has better staying power.  I might try that out :]",2
3,"These brushes feel great, but because they're smaller than I anticipated, I'm a little let down. With the tips of the brushes being about as big around as a quarter, they're too compact for me to actually get anything done with them. If you like smaller brushes, I bet you'll love these.",2
3,"It works okay but it is too watery for my liking.  The scent is very faint and if I use too much, it makes my hair oily.",2
3,I'm not sure my hair likes it...it made my hair feel frizzy. I'm not sure why but I'll try it again maybe it's something else.,2
3,"My wife watchers &#34;Bigfoot Hunters&#34; so I got her this as a gag gift. Not bad soap actually, but the scent is more manly.",2
3.0,"I'm sure this product works well, but I got so frustrated just trying to get the trays molded that I completely gave up! I spend 20 minutes dipping the trays in boiling water, pressing them against my teeth, etc. and they never changed. And they were so big they wouldn't even fit in the case. The gel may work well, but the trays were so poorly made it made me not want to try the rest. Really not trying to be negative, and it sounds like most people have a great experience, I'm just being honest.",2
3,They were a gift and he was happy.,2
3.0,"If you need a heavy conditioner, this isn't the one.  But for light conditoning it's great.",2
3,"I thought that I was getting the 8 ounce bottle but got the 5 ounce by mistake.  The quality of the product is really good.  BUT, the price is a bit steep.  Amazon has the best price on the 8 ounce.  Shop more and you'll find it.",2
3,"I've always used Dove soap bars, they have a beautiful look and ergonomic feel. My skin tends to dryness, so I steer clear of fragrance. I thought I'd try this sensitive skin formula in a liquid form. It's okay, I didn't notice anything remarkably different about my skin. The bottle is almost too large for a standard shower, and heavy, so when your hands are wet, be careful not to drop it which is easy to do given the smooth shape of the bottle, there's no way to grip it firmly. Most annoyingly, you can never get the last bit of soap out of this style bottle and wrestling the cap off is nearly impossible.",2
3,Very cute... my only problem was that i really thought it was gonna come with two bows..due to the picture ... 😢,2
3,"a little too glittery for my taste,I thought the colors were more matte.",2
3,The bow was beautiful but the net was smaller than expected.,2
3,"This stone was meant to replace my Dr. Scholl's brand pumice that I misplaced when i moved and it wasn't as tough.  i felt it could be less smooth to really do the job.  the shape was very easy to hold though.  It gets the job done, but i have had better.",2
3,"Not great, but good for the low price.<br />Probably wouldn't buy again, but I don't feel like I wasted my money",2
3,It's an ok fragrance.,2
3,"I expected a red-brown wig with loose curls at the bottom. I received a light brown to blonde wig with very tight curls throughout most of the wig. It still looks very cute on, but I would not have purchased if I had known what it would look like ahead of time.",2
3,Not the scent I was hoping for.,2
3,Fast seamless process. I used the One and Only once and was satisfied with the results.  I would recommend it to friends,2
3,"Avid Aveda user, looking to go a more natural route, but this does just an 'ok' job. Price was good, but result was not excellent.",2
3.0,Drying,2
3,"the product is...&#34;good&#34;<br />it's not as matte as I like, but it is matte.<br />it chips easily even with a good base and top coat.<br />very black, which i love.<br />black matte is very in right now too.",2
3,"i haven't use it ,just got it.<br />it not so big ,and i hope my skin like it .<br />but first of all,it smells good.",2
3.0,"Smells pretty much exactly like Terre D'Hermes, which is why I bought it.  The scent does not seem to last more than two hours, in my experience.<br />Although for this price, reapplying is not an unreasonable solution.",2
3,"This product is okay. If you take the time to slowly use this diffuser starting with wet hair, then the curls are definitely more lively but overall I don't know if it made enough of a difference for my hair, to make it worth the expense.",2
3,"Doesn't go on easily, doesn't feel or look natural, and it comes off so easily.",2
3,"I have used the product for the past two weeks consistently under my daily moisturizer and although I have seen some improvement in dark spots, I guess I expected more for the price.",2
3,👍🏼,2
3,My husband has been looking for a moustache wax he used decades ago but hadn't been able to find what he wanted and certainly not in any stores we shop in.  I found this wax and he said to give it a try.  It worked pretty good but I couldn't find this in anything but brown which is what his moustache used to be but is now silver.  So he gave it a try anyway.  It does keep the wild hairs in place but his silver is now a muddy looking color which is the down side.  He uses it sparingly and generally only when the hairs are extremely wild.  We will be looking for something closer to his color but he is fine with what we bought.  That is the main reason it didn't rate higher.  It does hold the wild hairs down with a stiff waxy feel but combed through it is more natural looking.  It arrived on time and in perfect condition.,2
3,Great for the price!,2
3,came on time. Is a good foundation.covers well stays on face about 6 hours then thins out and leaves face a little oily looking. I wouldnt recommand this to a friend.,2
3,Super Natural looks gorgeous: a shimmery peachy pink with almost a golden sheen to it! Perfect for spring! I love the color! Very unique. It dried super quick and is very opaque (even after only one coat).<br /><br />BUT: it chipped very fast after around 3 days. I usually do not have big problems with chipping of nail polish and was very surprised about this.,2
3,"I have used this mud masque for years and love the way it makes my skin feel and look. However, I have recently become a label reader of skin care and makeup products and was surprised to discover that this product contains parabens! It seems like such a natural product and I had no idea that purminerals would put parabens in their products! I no longer assume that when a product appears to be natural and safe that it is. I have become a more asture label reader! I will not be ordering it again.",2
3,"I actually like these as the straps are so thin, I don't notice them which is a problem with other sleep masks I've used.  The problem is that material is so s***ty it has repeatedly stained my fitted sheet.",2
3,"I had read that this was a great supplement for my body so I decided to give it a try, the the taste is a little different, but, ok, the way i view it is, if the benefit outweighs the difference in a palatable expierience, then I will go forward, and still try again, to see if this really does work.",2
3,I've been using it. I think it's doing good things for my skin. I don't really have problem skin so there wasn't anything to clear up. My skin gets dull so I was hoping this would help and it doesn't. Doesn't burn much at all. My face gets a little itchy. I don't leave it on for too long. I don't see any startling differences after I use it but that might just be my skin.,2
3,I have not opened this product as yet. I expect to begin using it in the next few weeks  It may take a bit longer to finish up My remaining hask.,2
3,"The soap was a good product. The smell is wonderful. You feel the tingle which lets you know it's working on the skin. it exfoliated my skin. however, it left certain parts if my face the same while exfoliating other parts of my face easily. I had to use cocoa butter to even it out. It's not really recognizable since I use the cocoa butter to even it out a little.",2
3.0,"Cool but the tassles on sides are useless, serve no purpose. But it is a cool bag for the price.",2
3,It's just a back scratcher. Nothing special. The head twists loosely as you try to use it on your back.,2
3,"After reading all the reviews for the mascara, I was expecting more.  The mascara does do some clumping at the sides of the eye.  Also, It does smudge every time I have worn it. My eyes tend to start watering after 3-4 hours.  I will not order this product again.",2
3,It is just ok. You need a lot to actually remove make up so it takes longer than my normal routine. I will not be purchasing it again.,2
3,"I like this shampoo & conditioner. Some dont like the smell, but i dont mind it. I find it relaxing. My hair did well with it the first two weeks, then it seemed to go back to its normal stringy, brittle type. This could also be my fault.. i wear my hair in a pony alot.. and brush it while wet :\ i'll work on changing those and seeing how this works. I probably also need a deep condition!! Next hair product i'll try is Hair One. I want something more organic and surprisingly Organix is not.",2
3,good smell,2
3,"Great product, however I now know I can buy hairspray for a lot cheaper & get the same effect from that",2
3.0,Razor good - just keep in mind before purchasing this razor that you need to sharpen it as it isn't sharp out of the box.,2
3,"These are very pretty but would be best for a person just beginning to wear lashes as they are quite thin but quite long from corner of eye to end so they need to be<br />trimmed before application.  Quality is good, however, just not thick as I wear.",2
3,"Basic dryer ,no expectations beyond the one you had previously",2
3,"I bought these rollers thinking that I could use them to give my long, thick hair body and curl without using damaging heat.<br />It comes with 9 very large rollers in a zipper bag. The curlers are like velcro on the outside, which is what qualifies them as \\""self holding.\\""<br />I put the rollers in with my hair mostly dry. They stayed on the top of my head pretty well, but the ones on the sides and back of my head didn't stay. I ended up using a small clip to hold them on and it worked ok. You can only use a small amount of hair before they are no longer self holding and the hair slips off the side of the roller, so I had to use a total of two packages on my head (I predicted that and bought two packages). Once my hair was in the rollers I felt like I couldn't move my head very much or they would fall out.<br />45 minutes later I took the rollers out and was left with full, shiny hair. It had lots of body and bounce. But no curl. Next time I will just use the rollers on the top layer of my hair. Overall, I'm happy with the rollers, even though the result wasn't what I was looking for. I just wish I would have bought one package instead of two.",2
3,"I'm used to using pomades and gels, so I thought I'd try this out to see how its different.  The bottle almost feels empty - this dust is really gravity defying... its a lot like a transparent powder.<br /><br />The idea is to give a dry messy look.  But I'm not sure I'm using the correct amount... it does sticky up the dryness of the hair, but maybe I'm using too much since it looks like I have dandruff.<br /><br />I'll keep experimenting with this product because its just so odd, but, for right now I stick to gels for my finish work.",2
3,"Decent hair cream. Not too heavy but strongly scented. Diminishes w time, but takes a while. Lightly smooths hair w out weighing it down",2
3,This brush was OK.  It is much thinner than I expected and did not have much firmness to it at all.  It is well made and the hairs DO NOT fall out but Im not sure what to do with it now since the reason why I bought it was to apply blushes.  Way to loose and thin for that!,2
3,"the pillow smells badly. but it is good for your neck. My husband used it and it makes his neck feels better. However, after using it, his neck also has a strong terrible smell. It's better to change the cover before you use it",2
3.0,"Used to be this was sold with the Headgear and tubing as a set. Now, everything is broken up into pieces and is priced at what it would have cost for the entire thing. I can't even find the entire assembly anymore. Progress?",2
3,"\\""Why is your beard so shiny?\\""<br /><br />Expect to hear that if you leave the house less than an hour after applying this product. It works well, making hair/beards easier to style as well as providing a definite softness. But the \\""healthy luster\\"" it imparts to your hair borders on \\""unnatural shininess\\"".<br /><br />The shine does go away after an hour or so, but if you're the type - like me - who showers, leaves the house, and gets breakfast and coffee on the way into work, you probably won't like budgeting the extra time into your routine. Even if it is probably better for you for a number of reasons.",2
3,"Its Shea Butter not much more to say about it. I did get my moneys worth. Melted it down and then mixed it with coco butter to use for my Psoriasis. Works ok but its Psoriasis so its really trial and error to find out what works best. It applies oily which wearing clothes it does get all over, but so does coco butter.",2
3,"I bought these for a girls summer camp.<br />The nail polish was sticky and rough long after it was dry.<br />It glowed in the dark and the girls had fun with it, but I would have liked it to dry smooth and not sticky.<br />A few bottles leaked around the lids during shipping.",2
3,I bought this product for an after tanning moisturizer. I'm not sure how well it performs because I could'nt get past the fragrance. The hard part about buying a product like this on line is you don't know how it smells but it's far to feminine for me so I gave it to my wife. I can't wait till she runs out of it. LOL,2
3,The fragrance doesn't last! I feel this is way too expensive for such disappointment. ($13.00)  I Have been using it on my sleeping pillows and it takes many sprays to even notice a fragrance. The fragrance is lovely and if I order it again it will be because I have used the whole bottle on pillow that finally has a hint of fragrance!!!!!!!,2
3,"There have been positive changes. My eyebrows are darker. The silverstreaks I had on them have disappeared. My hair has been salt and pepper for sometime. The salt was clearly overtaking the pepper. After working on my third bottle, the pepper is holding it's own against the salt. The hair on my temples has become darker. The grey on my left temple has stopped increasing and sections have gone darker. The most grey was on my right temple. It is still there, but there is darker hair now mixed in with the grey. I am going to keep using the product and will evaluate again later. I was skeptical but the changes to darker hair are noticeable. I have been thinking about using the catalase cream to see if that will give the darkening process a boost. If you go forward with using the product, give it time. As I wrote, I am on my third bottle.",2
3,"Based on the reviews, I was expecting this product to be excellent and to see a difference within a few weeks.  I am disappointed as I don't see a difference in my eyes at all.  I do agree that this is a rich forumula and a nice eye cream, but was a huge let down when it did no more than any other eye cream I've used.  I still like Bremann's products better as I see results when I use their eye cream products.",2
3,"I wanted to use this when I work 8 hour shifts and have to be moving around a lot. I noticed it melts a little bit easier, so unless stored in a climate controlled place it might be very gooey, or if you try to put it on you might have to blot with a paper towel afterwards. I noticed after a long shift I could smell my underarms, or after going to the gym. I'm a bit reluctant to go too hard on this product as it uses tea tree oil and lichen and doesn't have the same advantages one with lots of chemicals do. To be more specific the ingredients are (in order): propylene glycol, water, sodium stearate, stereth-100, lichen extract, fragrance, tea tree oil, triethanolamine, oleth-2, tetrasodium EDTA.<br /><br />It smells pretty good too. If you're just sitting down, I think it would meet your needs. But if you sweat a lot and don't want to be smelt at all, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.",2
3,"I love this scent and I get so many compliments when I wear it. However, neither the body mist nor the aerosol spray procure a lasting scent, although there's no alcohol smell, either. Maybe more benefit could be reaped from a trio with lotion, but with what I have to go on, I have to say that it's a low endurance fragrance.",2
3,"initially i really liked this air brush; it was my first air brush purchase.  i liked the brush that rotates to release my hair.  unfortunately the part that keeps it from rotating ended up stripping.  this happened rather quickly, within 6 months.  now it doesn't grip; i have to hold the brush portion to keep it from rotating.  it's too bad, because if that part hadn't stripped, i imagine it would last for quite some time.",2
3.0,I have my reservations about this product and if it really works at all. I think it just burns existing hair but really doesn't discourage hair growth. I feel I wasted money buying it in the first place and only replaced the thermicon tips in a last ditch effort to really see if I could make it work. Dumb me!,2
3,"This is a fairly light, not-too-greasy oil that's mildly moisturizing, but not that much more. It has a fairly pleasant, herbal scent, to my nose. And that's about all I can say. I don't believe for a minute that it can prevent or fade stretch marks (which are genetic, and which mostly fade on their own, anyway). I don't really have any scars, so I was unable to test that theory.<br /><br />I've also read on some sites that some people use this to treat acne. That seems extremely counterintuitive to me -- if you have oily, acne-prone skin, the LAST thing it seems you should do is put more oil on your face. This may help with very dry skin or with wrinkles, to an extent.",2
3,"The items arrived all right, but they had been thrown in a bag for shipping and the corners of the boxes were all bashed  in.<br /><br />Love the product thought, and the price was so good!",2
3,I like this brush but it is a bit stiff & can feel rough on delicate areas. But I will continue to use it until I find a softer one this size.,2
3,this shaver is just ok if you like the 5 o'clock look then this does a fine job with that but anything closer you should look elsewhere.,2
3,I haven't seen any improvement in my hair. If I use the No Poo cleanser by itself without the conditioner my hair is in better off.,2
3,"The product itself is good, it's on the smaller side. However, the package came with no instructions, nothing to tell the person what it was and what they needed to do to assemble it. It did come with two packages of green tea and brown rice which was very confusing.",2
3.0,a bit sticky....,2
3,Unfortunately I have a reaction to the product.  I used this product years ago and loved it.  For whatever reasons. I got a reaction after using the product.  Amazon was very good regarding the return and credit for this product.,2
3.0,I like it alot and fast delivery.,2
3,satisfied,2
3,"It is an ok choice - there isn't any burning with this product, but I would buy it again.  probably",2
3,Not a product to use for braiding hair.  Very thin hair and gets very tangly.  I see now why its supposed to be for cutting it!,2
3,"I received my Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall Technology, from Gillette. Before receiving this razor, I was using a ProGlide (minus the flexball) to shave my head. The three stars are for the FlexBall handle itself. The razor blade cartridge on it's own, would get a 5 star ratting. After trying the FlexBall Razor, I found that while the razor did an excellent job of cutting hair and leaving behind smooth skin, the FlexBall felt a little too loose when cutting long strokes along my scalp. It made it somewhat hard to cut straight lines and instead wobbled as I pulled each stroke across my head. Don't get me wrong, it did cut hair very well, and pulled through hair very well, but the FlexBall just felt weird and wobbly while shaving. One characteristic I like about ProGlide handles is, if you grab one with wet hands, the initially feel somewhat slippery. But, if you simply run it under water for just a second, (get it all the way wet) - it becomes VERY easy to hold on to and quite easy to grip.",2
3,The eye make-up is not as easy to apply as the face make-up. I had a tough time applying the eye liner powder with the brush and I have to go back and use my sisheido eye pencil. I already consider myself adept with applying makeup with brush but this product is not as easy to apply as it looks.  Alice,2
3.0,fast  shipment product is as described I personally dont like it as much but still great,2
3,"There used to be a lot of exfoliation beads in the product, but now there are so  much less and it effects the whole reason to use the product.",2
3,It's not made as well as I thought it would be.  Once it's full of product the weight makes the lid not line up for easy closure.,2
3,I always been told generic ones work the same brand ones.  Well I would definitely try a different one this one seems not to work pretty one,2
3,Not as comfortable as foam spacers. sticks to skin.,2
3,"The company really should have made this easier to get out of your hair. It's really really hard to get it out. You will always have some residue and you will just have to live with that, but it's probably the best wax I've ever used. Just make sure you consider that you will be shampooing and conditioning a lot to get it out.",2
3,"It's OK... but not great.  I have very hard water ( high in manganese) from a deep well.  It's not any better or worse than some cheaper<br />Conditioners.  Maybe it works for other types of hard water, but not so much for me.",2
3,It removes well but strong smell makes me cough. Not sure if I want to buy it again.,2
3,"Even with medium to light blonde hair, this barely worked. I was disappointed. Buy something else.",2
3,Too early to tell....,2
3,I love this. However I rate it low because personally it is far to potent in its fragrance. Smells like a Yankee doodle candle shop.,2
3,"These are the cheap dime store combs that I have not seen for many years.  The teeth are sharp and rough so be careful to start with.  I have only opened one so this one may be bad and the others OK.  If this happens I will let you know.  Now, for the price, a pretty good deal if you are not too critical.",2
3.0,"It makes my roots a tad bit less noticeable, but does not seem to adhere well to my hair and mostly falls to my scalp. I watched the video and have tried several times to replicate the results but no such luck.",2
3.0,i noticed a little bit of change in my skin complexion howevrer i would recommend vita clear by proactiv its nice,2
3,"I used this product once a week for 3 weeks in a row (or until product was finished) , didn't repurchase because I didn't see any difference in my hair. I gave it 3 stars because at least it didn't dry my hair out like some of those other deep conditioners. It just left it feeling the same. (I am a 4b natural.)",2
3,This wig is more straight then it is curly. It will do but now I have to still try and find one that is curly.,2
3,I received this in just a few days which is definitely a plus but was not at all like the picture.,2
3,It does not numb as well as it should...Sometimes I'm not sure if it numbs at all.,2
3,The lotion does gets you tan quickly just not on the legs or arms.  I tan about 4 days a week and seems as though the tan fades a bit after not going after 2 days.,2
3,Seems like a quality built product but disappointed in its performance.  Light seems to shine in your eyes. Mirror seemed smalled than I was expecting.,2
3,The frame is cheap plastic that is almost flimsy to the touch. The mirror part is nice. I think i might reframe it.,2
3,Product description states 800 mg. Actual product is 200 mg.<br /> I am disappointed about this fail advertisement. But I am hoping this product brings good result .,2
3,Was listed as face lotion. It's not. But it's still good lotion,2
3,"Goes on fantastically, but has too much of an orange tint!",2
3,"These are great refill blades.  The moisture edge helps prevent nicks and razor burn and eliminates the need for shaving cream.  Works great on legs and underarms.  Too large to effectively shave bikini area.  My disappointment with these has been the replacement time.  After 2-3 uses, the moisture edge is gone.  That puts the cost of replacement very high.",2
3,"The cord does not securely snap into the end of the razor for rechanging.  I leave the razon on it's side when recharging so that it does not fall out.  My Dad's face was a lot smoother when he used a razor & cream, than with this.",2

3.0,The image misleading shows three. One  could reasonably expect that for that kind of money you get multiple.,2
3,"i had use this product for 2 moths and i notice just a little bit result on my eyelashes but my eye brown got more darker.  i was happy but also dissapointed 2.And also i notice that it affect my vision, so i stop using this product.",2
3,Seems to pull a bit more due to speed of product - I have tried a few  this was to replace the one that took a walk..This will do for now...Still don't get why these seem to be a bit over priced... Just yet another thing women have to purchase to maintain. Hair&#34;-),2
3,"I was slightly disappointed that it was &#34;so&#34; shimmery, but good pigment.",2
3,The retractable cord rarely fully retracts and it doesn't seem to get as hot as other hair dryers I have had in the past,2
3,"I heard rave reviews about this product, but I was not impressed.  I think I will stick with Resurgance by Murad.",2
3,This hand held model works fine but the water tank is too small. You need to fill it at least twice.,2
3,"At first I was disgusted with this product. I used it everyday faithfully for two weeks and my legs still felt shaggy. Finally I had to shave with a razor. The next day and everyday since then I have used this shaver and it has been doing a pretty good job. The trick seems to be to start with your legs already free of any noticeable hair growth then use this product everyday to keep hair from becoming visible; your legs actually will feel smooth. I think Conair should say that in the instuctions and save people a lot of aggravation. <br /> <br />The advantages of this shaver are: <br />1. I can sit comfortably in a chair to shave instead of lying on my back in the tub with my leg in the air. <br />2. It's convenient. I don't have to get undressed and get wet. I can shave while the bath water is running so it saves time. <br />3. It's easy on my skin (though razor burn hasn't been a problem for me since I started making my own soap). <br /> <br />The disadvantages are: <br />1. Your have to keep it charged. I'm not sure I would bother to take it if I was traveling. <br />2. It does actually take longer than shaving with a razor, but I find it more pleasant to use so maybe I just do it longer. <br />3. It is useless against visible hair. <br /> <br />",2
3,"Hmmm, what can you say about \\""Age Repair Lotion\\""?  I mean it feels creamy & I'd love to think it's doing it's job, but don't you kinda have to question anything that takes natural wrinkles from aging outta your face?  Or for that matter should I really be critcal if I don't see results over night?  Sounds good on paper & all with the SPF 30 blended within, but... ?  Same goes with the \\""Wrinkle Smoothing Cream\\"".  This is supposed to over time smooth wrinkling (not completely take them away, just smooth them), but so far in my experiance it's just made my face oily.  Best outta the box is the \\""Eye Restoration Complex\\"".  If I were to purchase any of the products again singly it would be this one for sure.  The \\""ERC\\"" is supposed to take away puffiness & dark spots around the eye area (again, not completely), & I can definately see a differance since I 1st started using it.  A little side warning out there for everyone, this definately doesn't feel good when you get it in your eyes, so be careful of that.  In the end, would I buy the whole package again?  No, probably not, not because I hate it or anything, just don't know that I wanna invest in something without any immediate results.  I would however definately buy the eye cream again.  In closing I guess it's really about what you need & what you're after, one things for sure though, the eye stuff works.",2
3,I just started using this product so far I am having good results.  I just need more time to see a difference,2
3,It is an OK product.  Nothing wrong with it but not any better than a single color blusher.  I will probably buy another in the future unless I find something better.,2
3,"The soakers did not work as well as i would like, but I am not upset because I did not pay that much for them. In order for them to work, I had to add way too much nail polish remover. i feel that it is just easier to use a cotton square.",2
3,"they almost look like they are just squares, they look like studs but not pointy enough for me",2
3,"If you want to stretch it and scrub your back, buy \\""Earth Therapeutics Hydro Back Strap Massager\\"" instead - it's much stronger. Swissco falls apart from such abuse. Otherwise, it's nice and soft.",2
3,"I have been using Younique 3D fiber lashes, thought I'd see how these compare.  The gel has an odor, which I don't get with Younique.  My lashes seemed to clump more also",2
3,"I bought this stuff as a facial sunscreen, something I could use under my makeup every day. I did that for about two months before I couldn't take the greasy look anymore. My face was always greasy. My pores seemed to get bigger too and now they won't go down. It's a fine sunscreen but maybe only use it on days when you plan to be outdoors. I'll need to keep looking for a nongreasy sunscreen to wear daily.",2
3,"Works good, but the oil smells like sour manure.",2
3,"Third day using the Gillette Fusion Proglide- with Flexball Handle that I received from Gillette. I am still trying to get used to the large handle and I see no difference in the closeness of the shave from the other type of Gillette I normally use.  This shaves close, easy to use; just the handle is bulky.",2
3,"First of all I have to say that I have been a huge fan of the Dove soaps for many years and when this product came out, I was looking forward to using it.  As one who has a lot of thick hair, I regularly use a similar product before drying my hair and I have tried several different ones that on the market and have been satisifed with them. However, I was somewhat disappointed with this product.  I have tried it twice, and both times it did not leave my hair feeling silky. I even used a larger quantify the second time thinking that I perhaps didn't use enough the first time, but I basically had the same results.  So, in all honesty, I can't recommend this product.",2
3,"It is really loud, does not blow very hard. but it does gets really hot. So its ok for the money.",2
3,I have the oil and I love it mainly bc of the scent and the softness I am left with.  I recently ordered the curl intensifier and I am very disappointed in the scent. I got it  from an online beauty store and I almost feel as if I got tricked bc the product doesn't  smell anything like the oil.  I may try going to a salon and just smelling the product   to see if I have been dupped.  I will say the it hasn't tackled the frizz like other   products so I won't be buying this again unless I find out I was suckered into a fake  product.,2
3,Not the miracle blackhead extractor people promised it to be. It left my face feeling very soft but there are lots of projects that can do that.,2
3.0,Doesn't charge ..,2
3.0,"Aussie sprunch spray is ok for the cost, however it is not my favorite product. I have naturally wavy hair and am always seeking a product that can define my waves and keep them from being frizzy, without weighing them down and creating a greasy look. It's hard to find. I found the sprunch spray, when applied &#34;just right&#34; worked, but often left my hair looking greasy. Also, I found the bottle hard to use with one hand. The trigger got stuck and was difficult to push....maybe I'm just weak, but it was tough at times. I think for the cost, it's ok, but I would rather spend a little more and get a better product.",2
3,ok for the price,2
3,"I suffer from seriously dry skin during the winter, so I am always interested in anything that can help with that problem. The lotion in the SpaSensials smells & feels nice, but my main reaction was that I didn't find this product to be any more effective than my usual routine (rubbing lotion on my feet and then putting on a pair of ankle socks). I liked using the SpaSensials, but the end result doesn't justify the much higher cost of the product. Really, the only advantage is that you can moisturize your feet without getting messy foot cream all over your hands.",2
3,I've been using this product I'm not sure what it does. it doesn't take out tangles but I guess it's supposed to put vitamins into my hair. still trying it and hope to see results.,2
3,has a different scent I am not really liking but is an okay product. not worth the extra expense,2
3,"I have eczema and I've been suffering from it for years. Occasionally they will go away but during hot or cold weathers, or my allergies kick in and they tend to come out very bad. I eat healthy and exercise regularly. So it's not my diet or health it's something I'm born with and still have yet to find a cure. I heard about this product from a friend, she told me she purchases it at walmart and sometimes on amazon. She bought it for her son that is 8 years old with mild eczema. Do note not all walmarts have this, so I bought it online for $11. Packaging and shipping was good. In hopes I was looking for a moisturizer to aid maintains moisture to my dry cracked eczema skin. But my personal experience it did not work for me. And if I put too much my skin felt irritated and itchy. But I give it 3 stars because its a good moisturizer for parts if my skin that don't have eczema.  I will continue my search, but this might work for you if you don't have severe eczema. Hope this helps",2
3.0,"Small enough to fit into your makeup bag and carry everyday. Adds just enough color to where you need it. Handy but not great. I love all bareMineral products cause they are light and wearable daily but this is just okay. It has the brush which is a plus. For something small and compact, this is worth it.",2
3,Colors are pretty summer colors but are more matte than expected. As long as you use a top coat there isn't a problem but I was a little surprised when I first tried them.<br />They are all VERY neon.,2
3,"I bought this product to try out a hair shampoo. The scent was so strong that I did not even use it. It may be a great product, but my husband does not like the smell. I plan on sending it to my sister to see if she likes it.",2

3,"I did a lot of research before I purchased this product. I am not thrilled with it and will probably buy something to replace it eventually. I like the way it looks when I'm finished applying it, it's just so difficult to apply. I dot some underneath my eye and use a concealer brush to blend and cover. Its hard to blend and kinda thick. I feel like I have to tug on the delicate under eye skin in order to spread it. And that's after applying eye cream and the rest of my skincare products. I Will continue looking for my HG undereye concealer.",2
3,"I actually bought this because one of my friends wears it and I really like the way it smells so I got this, and it is exactly what I thought it would be, a little sample bottle.",2
3,"it was okay,  but when i was brushing it, the hair kept falling off, i guess, is not going to last",2
3,I was so excited to see my package came. I opened up the box and then when I seens white everywhere I knew one had to have been broken..MORE LIKE 5 were. I was so upset. Worst part I cant contact the seller. Only good part the colors I do have are very pretty.,2
3.0,"I recently ordered the Tweezerman Safety Slide Callus Shaver with Rasp and at first sight was reluctant to use it. The shaver is not bad at all, but the blade sure as hell is. I needed to peel off some dead skin, so I tried to lightly slide as directed on the instructions, and it would continually want to sink in deeper causing bleeding. The product works, but it hurts in the process.",2
3,Doesn't hurt anything but haven't seen any difference.,2
3,Leaves behind way too much white stuff to use anywhere but the beach - and even there you look pretty bad.,2
3,Not bad we definitely need a lip balm.,2
3,it stick really well but it dry gray for me and my eyeliner is really black but only in pic but for daily use is ok,2
3,"Its cute....I may keep it or give away as a gift, I thought it would like a little different then what it looks like.",2
3,"Item was just ok. I would have been much more please if I had recieved it in one piece. Yes 3,000 little rhinestones all falling out when I opened the package was needless to say not going to make me happy. The case they came in was made of cheap plastic with seperate compartments for all the differant colors. But now all i have is a crushed case with flimbsy flip tops and a nice mix of rhinestones. they are no longer seperated by color due to the case crushing. so I have yet to even use these due to the fact that it will take hours to seperate them.  The quality of the rhinestones themself are ok,, a little bigger then say one you would get at a nail salon.",2
3,I'm glad I purchased this brush to apply an acid peel however it doesn't spread the product that well but it will do for the price. I also had to file the edge it had a jagged corner near the bristles.,2
3,I love my extensions just wish there were more ir they were thicker... They are so thin at the ends of my hair!,2
3,This product was less expensive at Target.  The tool itself is great and easy to use.  My daughter was pleased with the gift.,2
3,"Good looking bottle, product smells nice and when you finally get a drop or two out its easy to apply.<br /><br />The bottle top has to be redesigned, its a nightmare trying to get the necessary amout out without flinging the stuff everywhere.",2
3,"While this lotion has the great scent of The One, it is the Golden Satin Body Lotion and it contains gold glitter that is visible on your skin after use. I also think the scent does not last very long. However, the price is much less than the retail price, so I still think it was a good deal.",2
3,Its way to smaller than I expected.  The whole thing is so delicate that you really cannot use it day in and day out.  I was not very happy with it.,2
3,"The mirror does it's job I just thought it'd be bigger. The luck sucks, I don't know why it's even there.",2
3,Not Very Bright...,2
3,It was okay.,2
3,"I used this color on my hair and didn't get too great of results.  What did dye pink faded pretty quick.  Unless you have freshly bleached hair that is stripped prior to application, you aren't going to get your hair the color on the box.",2
3,"The smell is almost overwhelmingly strong. It smells really good though. My baby's daycare teacher told me she likes it. It seems to make his rashes worse though, and its hard to get the smell out of the diapers when I wash them. Now I use it for my own skin or sometimes I spray it into the air in the bathroom if one of the kids stinks it up.",2
3,My hair got frizzy after using this product and I've had to use argan oil to keep it in place.  It's just ok.,2
3,"This was ok not something I will buy again, but I wash my hands a lot and take baths, so the polish didn't stay on very well.",2
3,"It looks pretty online but when I received the comb, it was just too much for me!  But I'm keeping it to give as a gift...just have to find the right person.",2
3,Used at night.. Do not like smell when going to sleep. It is bother me but on morning feel better on skin.,2
3,"This product looks nice but I couldn't use all the brushes.  The brushes had a very strong chemical scent.  I'm not usually sensitive to strong scents, but the chemical scent was too strong for me.  I was only able to use the eyebrow brushes.  The only reason I kept the product and didn't return it, was because I really liked the silver carrying case they came in.  The case works really well for travel and it looks nice.",2
3,I like how hot it gets but it leaks in my clients!,2
3,Purchased this hand cream due to the glowing reviews.<br />The reality is that it does an OK job at moisturizing my hands. I prefer Strivectin.,2
3.0,I have been taking it for a month and so far I haven't notice any earth shaking changes to my energy level. I have noticed a odor coming from my urine. I'll try a few more months and see what happens. Stay tuned.,2
3,"product. I heard such good things so when I saw a deal on Curl Mart-I jumped at the chance to try it. It wets the hair really well, but not much curl definition for me. I am still going to try some of their other products, hoping for better results",2

3,"product was not what I expected, pads get dried really quick, only last for a couple minutes, not so happy.",2
3,The moisturizer is OK but the top that attaches to a spring came off as soon as I go it.  Now when I travel it leaks everywhere.,2
3,"Clips in OK, and looks OK. Daughter needed this for a dance recital.",2
3,"My kids loved it. It smells great, i just wish they would make the conditioner seperate. My childs hair is a bit hard to comb through after using tbis shampoo.",2
3,"I'm not sure I like the scent itself, but it was good that I was able to order a sample size to try the perfume before actually buying a full-size bottle.  I wish all perfumes -- and perfume-selling websites -- would offer this option.  Thanks!",2
3,"I really like all Archipelago products,..and this item really  lasts long, I just picked a really bad fragrance, (Politano).  It smells like a mix of lemon, shoes, & some type of mens cologne.  Yuk.  It would be nice if there's some type of scent description on these.",2
3,"I have a sensitive scalp and most of the reviews I read leaned towards this product not burning as much as most others. It still burned...a lot! the timer was set to 12 minutes for total time including application and smoothing as per the instructions but had to rinse out at 7. The neutralizing conditioner really works and boy was I happy about that! After rinsing out the relaxer my hair did not feel good at all. I used the conditioner as directed and was not to pleased when I rinsed it out. Then I did the restructuring mask...AMAZING RESULTS! Over all my scalp is fine, looks healthy, no visible burns found or felt.",2
3,"poor quality, but doesn't look bad",2
3,"There was a strong (not necessarily bad) smell when I opened it. The case is pretty cute, and the brushes are very soft, but during washing them and just after 1 use it's shedding :(. I also WISH that it came with a foundation brush. I think the 3 most important brushes in this set are the blush brush, the powder brush and the fan brush. The only thing missing is a foundation brush and I'd be set. I tried to use the power brush for my foundation but it is wayyyy too flimsy for that.<br /><br />Overall, not that bad. Not that great either. 10/10 on presentation, 7/10 on product",2
3,"if you lost your stethoscope and can not afford a new good one, this is an acceptable stethoscope.

The price is cheap, however I do not recommend it for medical students who are going to start their clinic, you guys better to get a good one.",2
3,Love the idea and it worked for awhile.  The cord retractor started not working very well then quit altogether.  I bought as a travel piece since I travel with my job but if I can't retract the cord then it is just the same as the one I have at home...bulky.  Tried to take it apart to fix the retractor and well...that wasn't an easy task and I couldn't fix it.,2
3,"It's okay.Wish Remington would have a corded model at this price. If they did, I'd give this 5 stars.",2
3,"I have used many eye makeup removers on the market.  I was anticipating that this product, being \\""simple\\"" wouldn't actually cause burning in my eyes.  But, it does.  I have never experienced this with any other makeup remover before.<br /><br />It does an OK job removing eye shadow, but if you use liquid liner you will have to scrub at it a bit (gently of course, it is your eye you are washing).<br /><br />I won't be buying again,,,the eye burn just makes it difficult when you want to put your contacts in.",2
3,"Yes, I have noticed SOME change in the way my nastiness looks, however, it's not as drastic as others have mentioned in their reviews. I'm also dieting and exercising daily (hardcore like elliptical & stepper for 45 minutes not feeble 15 minute walks or anything) so I expected it to work better. Also, the bottles have so little product for the price. I'll use it until it's gone but I won't buy it again.",2

3,"I love Sweet Pea. As a teen, I just fell in love with it. I received a Sweet Pea gift set from my Hubby for Mother's Day. I was running low so decided to purchase a bottle on Amazon. Well, it got here, shipping was super fast! But when I sprayed a bit on... It had an extra scent that was a bit off. It smelled like alcohol and Idk what else. I just know that it didn't smell like what was purchased from Bath And Body Works. I gave it 3 stars because the smell is tolerable and it doesn't actually stink... But I'll just go to the actual store to purchase this scent.",2
3,it ok but not good as i though it wod be,2
3,"Paper thin, but I have them over a cushioned cover, so no complaints.  I did received them sooner than I had expected which did make me happy!",2
3,"The electric shaver seems to work fine.  However, it did have hairs stuck in it when we received it.  Could it be used or refurb.?  We will see how it works in the coming weeks",2
3,"I'm have mixed feelings about this stuff. I bought it hoping that it would help my dry, cracked winter hands but you can't really use this stuff has a hand cream - it's just way to greasy. After applying you can't touch anything or you will grease everything up. My solution has been to mix it with a non-greasy lotion and then to wear it to bed under cloth gloves. I think it has helped my chapped hands some and I definitely think it has helped soothe my eczema, so that's been nice, but the best thing about this product is the smell! If I end up getting another tin full it will be because I have to smell that smell -- it is the most wonderful, sweet, fresh coconut smell you can imagine. If you shut your eyes and take a whiff, it's not hard to imagine you're sitting on a beach in Hawaii, covered in Hawaiian Tropic suntan oil and drinking coconut milk from a straw! Aaahhhh--coconut  ; )",2
3,Great price! Although it does loose a lot of bristles I would recommend it to others if the price was an issues.,2
3,I purchased this item minimize a small scar on my face. The scar was fairly new (a month old.) I put on gel twice a day for a month and didn't notice any difference in color or size :(,2
3,"not a bad product, but wears off within 3-4 hours. also, quite different from most new colognes/smells, so I suggest trying it in a store first. Amazon does have a great price for it though!",2
3,"These colors are pretty. However, you might need to invest in a lip primer. These lipsticks tend to bleed and do not last long. After using these lipsticks with a primer, I enjoyed them even more. Worth the price, fun to play with.",2
3,"I use a lot of Venus products, and they typically work great & last longer than they are supposed to... but these don't seem to shave as well and I feel like they don't get quite close enough & have to shave more often. If this is for use at home, I would use a different Venus product (maybe the original refillable one). since these are disposable, this is probably better for travel.",2

3.0,"I feel bamboozled by Palmers. To start off, I have type 4, dense/fine/coily hair that is really soft and fluffy but it's highly prone to dryness if not taken care of properly. I've recently officially fell in love with their products: coconut protein pack, I love their conditioner, finally I love their deep conditioning pack. I wish Palmers would get on the Suave wave and make the big bottles, because I can't do anything with the tube. My mother keeps Palmers around so when I ran out of the fancy stuff, I used it to wonderful results. Palmers conditioner in the tube is excellent by itself and as a deep conditioning base if mixing in your own combo of oils/ingredients. Once again the size isn't enough for me. This palmers love affair has taken a few years to build being that I tend to overlook the store/cheap-ish/regular brand, common human nature. Nonetheless, Palmers has become my go to. So I'm in Walmart picking up a deep conditioning pack and I notice Palmers has new products. It's almost 2am, I've just gotten done from eating out so I'm in a great mood, this is a perfect time to try products. I know the edge control is on my list to try but I peeped the strong roots spray and the dry oil mist. Instantly I'm torn on which to choose but I found an in-store coupon so I decided to get both. My goal with the products is to have something handy to moisturize my hair quickly. I tend to have trouble keeping my hair moisturized in between DC's and washes. Also my scalp/roots tend to be forgotten amidst everything else. Also the oil blends were a check for me (Alma, Coconut, Vitamin e, and Argan oil, my hair loves those). This is where the love affair comes in, I trusted Palmers! I've used several of their products and never had issues with ingredients so I did not thoroughly read the ingredients list nor did I do a smell check. *I also take responsibility that it was 2am and I was full/had a drink or two on me.* I get home and immediately use the products two things stuck out but it was so early to catch it. 1) I caught the scent of alcohol, but the roots spray feels so good on the scalp so I overlooked it 2) the consistency of the dry oil was off for &#34;oil&#34;. Oils like Olive, Argan, and Vitamin e are thick. I also have other oil sprays that sit on your skin until you rub it in. These sprays were thin, I figured, oh it's water since they evaporated quickly. It wasn't until the next day I checked the ingredients to see 1) a caution not to use heat until dry and 2) alcohol in the ingredients. I'm officially heartbroken and torn. Palmers products usually leave my hair feeling way better than before. Using these two products it's meh. It's not horrible but it's not soft like I know Argan and Olive oil can leave my hair. I haven't used alcohol products in years and I don't think I'm trying to start again. I also don't have the energy to return these products, so I'm stuck. I'm not sure if I want to test these further on my hair. Researching the SD-Alcohol 40 B ingredient, it's the simple alcohol or ethanol not the fatty, good kind. However, I  did read ethanols still can help other ingredients interact with the skin and that it's not toxic (regarding skincare products), after reading a few articles concerning hair it's the same principle. The alcohol is supposed to &#34;help&#34; the transportation of the other ingredients to the hair or help evenly spread the product then evaporate. For expensive, thick oils like Argan and Vitamin E, I get it. The alcohol thins them out so they spread better. However, it can still have adverse effects because it's alcohol at the end of the day. The evaporation can still take the oils out, i.e. toners. Man the trust and love I had with Palmers has been tainted. I wish they were more upfront on the packaging besides a warning. Their products have been so good, and they're sulfate and paraben free so why use alcohol?! It's no secret the brand caters to natural hair women, and it's known in our community we don't like alcohol in our products. Because of my research I will ride these products out most likely only because my hair doesn't feel horrible (thanks to my extensive protein and deep conditioning habit) but it's not soft and my hair has hints of alcohol in it, but I can smell the usual Palmers scent their products have. I will be actively looking for replacement products though in the mean time until I know for sure this isn't going to damage my hair. With all that being said, I'd say only get this product if you're well versed on natural hair (you know how to use products correctly), you know your hair and haven't had issues with alcohol in the past, and you're consistent with good hair practices (deep conditioning, protein). I really trusted Palmers. Smh.nity we don't like alcohol in our products.

3,"The Simple Eye Make-Up Remover Pads seem to be a little dry and do a mediocre job of removing eye make-up.  The little package is slightly hard to open and had to be cut, which helps make the drying out process quicker.  The pads are convenient, especially if you are in a hurry and need a quick job, but I prefer to use other products which use more moisture and are much better at removing mascara.",2

It does have a little grit to it so I am sure it is pulling some dead skin off my face? Luckily it was not too expensive. I really have no option one way or another about it.,2
3.0,I bought  this because I heard the rave reviews of it and I've never used a single blade before. I bought a 10 pack of Merkur blades with it. At first I wasn't sure how to shave with it but then I slowly figured it out. I think my major gripe is that the blades don't last as long only about two to three shaveswhere my regular razors would last at least double or triple that. I guess the merkur system is just not for me.,2
3,good,2
3,I received Gillette Venus Embrace courtesy of Influentster.com. Along  with an Oil of Olay changeable blade. This is a great way to find what works best for a person's taste in a razor. Many choices in razors but the oil of Olay wasn't my favorite because the built in moisturizer gets in the way of the blades.,2
3,"*UPDATE, 9/18/13: Recently did a mani with regular nail polish (OPI). Put this on after 2 coast of polish, dried each hand for about 2-3 mins under a little battery-powered nail fan, and thought my nails felt about 90% dry before going to bed. Boy was I wrong! I woke up the next morning to discover very deep sheet and crease marks all over my nails. I deducted a star because, when using with regular nail polish - which I assume would be the most common application - this stuff takes FOREVER to dry. I made sure to dry each polish coat fairly well before applying this, so I'm not sure what went wrong. Really surprised at the lackluster results when using this with regular polish, but discovered Seche Vite works like a charm. As for the durability, I think 2 weeks is definitely a stretch; you'd be lucky to get to 6 or 7 days (which is fairly good amount of time regardless, but still...). I'll give it one more go, but I'm dubious that this lives up to its claims!<br /><br />Having only used it once and only with nail polish strips, it was great! Helped my polish strips last 7 days (in combo with the Orly Bonder basecoat) and dries to a nice shine! Will test it out soon with regular nail polish and hoping the long-lasting results will be equally great!",2

3,The contour is VERY dark. I am a pale redhead and no amount of blending could make this color work with my snow white skin. Blush is a nice pink -very light.,2
3,I used this shaver exclusively for the three week period in their instructions. It did not even come close to a blade. It did give me a closer shave when I used it with shaving cream. I will work OK for that quick shave when you are on the go and don't have time for anything else. On the plus side the battery will last for many shaves before recharging.,2

Also very frustrating is when you order makeup you usually need it with in a few days if not immediately!  I ordered on June 25th, it shipped July 6th and I received it on July 11th.  Then when I get it it is the wrong color.  Now I have to reorder and there is no refund for open products.",2

I will not be ordering this again, I have another brand I have been using for about a year and I re-ordered that at half the price.  It's called DDF  Brightening Cleanser and it comes in a 6 oz bottle for $24.99.  A much better deal.",2
3,"Having a very thick beard I have always looked to use the latest shaving technology. Unfortunately, the latest technology is often designed for the mainstream user, rather than those of us in the thick beard minority. As such, the Mach 3 never really gave me a nick free shave, but at least the shave was smooth.    When Schick released the Quattro Titanium I was very excited in that I hoped the blades would last longer, thus saving me money between buying replacement cartridges. However, I had two problems when shaving with this product. First of all the blades are too close together, and so angled, that my thick beard won't fit between them. Second, is the wires (while a great idea for reducing nicks) keep a certain amount of space between your face and the blade preventing those of us with thick hard beards from getting a close shave. As a result I have to push the razor harder against my face, thus resulting in the very nicks the wires are meant to prevent.    Recently I tried the Gillette Fusion Power, which has 5 blades, and was pleasantly surprised. I'm not totally sure why, but my thick beard fits between the blades (even though there are more of them than the Quattro) and because there are no wires I get an incredibly smooth shave. I believe the blades are thinner and smaller than Schick's, allowing Gillette to fit five blades with more spacing between them than Schick fits between their four; either that or Gillette has found a way to angle them so thick beards aren't a problem. The Fusion blades also rinse a lot better than the Quattro, which often got clogged beyond my ability to clean them. What I love best about the Fusion though is the precision trimmer on the back (allowing me to adjust my sideburns and goatee with single blade accuracy). My only gripe is that the precision trimmer was an idea that I passed on to Gillette many years ago and they pretty much blew me off saying that they knew what they were doing and didn't see a need for such a feature.It's not like I'm looking for money or anything, but if they're going to steal my idea the least they could have done was to be polite when I gave it to them.    So for me the Fusion is the way to go. This doesn't mean the Quattro won't be a fine razor for those of you with less challenging beards.",2
3,"I like the way the applicator can put an even and pleasant application of the product.  Yet, I have found myself ordering this same product for the third time in one year.

I wanted to see if there really was a difference between super expensive oils and super cheap oils. There is. The first thing I did was smell this oil, and though it does smell nice, it is definitely not as strong of a smell as another peppermint oil that I have.

Also, you need to use a primer first to fill in the wrinkles or they will just be highlighted.  Also, use a concealer brush and tap it on.

I can no longer see the color but I still feel the moisture, the conditioning the lipstick is providing so I know it is still there. The color just fades fast.<br /><br />What I do like is as I mentioned above: my lips feel moisturized. I've tried many lipsticks that have had the opposite effect.

3,"I started burning incense to help me fall asleep at night.  Its the whole pavlov's theory,  When I am tired, I lit up a cone and smelled it.  Then after a while, I associated the smell with sleep.  Now when I light up an incense cone, I get all relaxed and snuggle into bed for a good nights sleep.  The problem was, I ran out of incense!<br /><br />Since the first batch of incense I got was a gift, I wasn't sure where to buy them, or even what to look for.  I found these on amazon, and decided to buy them. When I got them in, I knew instantly what they were, as there was a pungent smell coming from the smiley amazon box.  I opened it up and pulled out the contents.<br /><br />The packaging for these incense is on the cheap side, and though there are 12 different fragrances, they pretty much all smell the same.  The 12 fragrances come in individual little boxes and a small burning tray is included with each.  It's a nice little addition, but they are just little tin coins.  The smell is overpowering at first, and the quality of the cones are descent..  I'd say 1/2 of the cones are lopsided, and I was worried about this when burning them, but so far, have had no troubles.<br /><br />They do burn well, almost to the base, and fill the room with that incensey smell, we have all grown to know and love, in new age shops.  Overall, I think the price is good for what you are getting.  I mean, they are incense.. so....<br /><br />I would but these again, but I would probably look at the competition first.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Cheap<br />- Come with Burning trays/disc's<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Poorly made (they lean and some had the tops cracked off)<br />- Fragrances all smell the same.",2

The overall scent was pleasant enough and the sticks did have a nice slow burn which is always a good sign. This incense is better than most of the cheap store bought stuff that is passed off for incense. I think the manufacturers of this particular incense attempted to cut to many corners or use substitute inferior products which weakened the scent, mixed in with the pleasant scent, was a pungent unpleasant mystery Oder that surfaced almost subliminally minimizing the olfactory pleasure. Overall this incense is not for the aficionado, but for every day home use in small quantities for some one that is not to picky about their background incense, it is acceptable.",2

3,"Vitamin C is a staple of my skincare routine, and with all my research this product is top quality. The best vitamin c serums from my research, should include L-Ascorbic Acid between 15-20%, Vitamin E, Magnesium Ascobyl Phosphate & Ferulic Acid. Rejuvelle has the highest amount of these ingredients on Amazon, Ferulic Acid 1%, Vitamin E 2% and the purest most researched form of vitamin C L-Ascorbic Acid at 20%, not to mention magnesium ascorbyl phosphate and peptides which are the building blocks of skin. Seriously, be careful of the cheaper brands, they use cheap Vitamin C derivatives that are currently not researched enough to prove that they work. Skinceuticals spent millions on research for C E Ferulic but it is way too expensive for me these days, and Rejuvelle is a great alternative at under $40. I have seen a noticeable difference in my skin, softer, more radiant and more even toned, I have some brown age spots which have lightened which I am really happy about and my fine lines are really not as noticeable.  I will continue to use this product, and I would recommend it to anyone to give it a go. You really do get what you pay for. The product absorbs well and it feels like you have a protective layer on when it dries, it has a slight scent but dries odorless and doesn't bother me. Now I am so happy with this, I will buy more products from this company.  Thank you for making such a great, affordable product. I LOVE IT !!",2

3,"I bought this unit from Bed Bath & Beyond because I had a 20% off coupon and because of the easy return policy. I bought it primarily to do my 95 year old mother's hair because I would be less likely to burn her than I would with a curling iron. She has short, very fine hair,  and I have long, relatively thick hair. I really have mixed feelings on this one.<br /><br />Granted, I can curl my mother's hair without burning her and can get a little closer to her scalp less the length of the bristles. I didn't get as firm a curl as I do with the curling iron, and it seems that her hair looks &#34;oily&#34; much sooner. I also noticed that the curl doesn't hold very long. For my hair, that is naturally straight and doesn't hold curl very well, I got a good bend in the ends when I first did it, but the next day it was totally straight again. I also didn't get any &#34;lift&#34; in the top at all. For me, I still prefer the InStyler Rotating Curling Iron. I can do my hair when it is damp and the curl lasts much longer.",2
3,I seen this color on swatches online and I thought I would love it.  But it has a grey tone to it and it just doesnt do nothing to my white skin tone.  This color would look great on a darker complected person.  I used three coats to get full coverage too.,2
3,"Giving this 3 stars as i ordered purple but received green, otherwise it would have been a 5. It was a gift for my mom, but she actually likes the green better anyways so its a win still. great straightener!",2
3,the stubble trimmer is somewhat weaker than expected<br />could not trimm to desired beard length efectively to get a stuble of few milimeters  long,2
3,"Tough combs will really hold your hair back, but the teeth of the combs will deform after wearing a few times.",2
3,The old standard is still around. I am a fan of soaps that have tallowate as an ingredient. They seem to be slicker than those without it. I think a better soap of this kind is Arko stick. The [[ASIN:B002A5OLHQ Arko Shaving Soap Stick]] is soft enough that you can mash it into a shaving bowl/cup/scuttle and get fantastic lather. Williams is not quite as good IMO.,2
3,"I'm 22 and I have to say this was not my favorite. I got it right before Christmas and gave it to my mom, she loved it but wasent for me",2
3,"Definitely still use regular shampoo. This works better as a leave-in conditioner and nothing else. If you use it all the time for your shampoo+ conditioner your hair ends up having so much buildup, not attractive and not manageable.",2
3,Ordered 2 of these and one of them had a stretched out elastic band so it would not stay on my head.,2
3,"this is my first bigsexyhair product i ever got, yes, it did gave me some volume and it holds the tease. But after a while it made some of my hair stick together and it went really stiff.....",2
3,"I know it says that it's new, more sustainable but I beg to differ.  Before I could use the bath or shower gel and it would smell nice and fresh for a much longer time than it does now.  It is thicker but does not lather as well.  I like the lemony smell so I will continue to buy, but the makers should go back to the old formula.  Even my 6 year old grand noticed thew difference.",2
3,"There isnt too much of a story behind this purchase. I just needed a comb. There are very cheap, but they are made of a cheap thin plastic. But for a broke college student, as I am, these get the job done.",2
3,I was expecting a very soft gel case and this is more plastic.  Works ok but it is not a soft gel case.,2
3,Didn't like the smell..,2
3,"a little too light and cakey looking for me.  Probably best for younger skin.  A little goes a long way, and it's a good value for the size/price.",2
3,The mirror is all that is helpful.,2
3,"Bought them for my daughter to play so wasn't expecting much, but they are nicer than I thought for fake hair. Was going to order more for my little cousin, waited for them to restock, but now they are double the price as before.......so I'll find cheaper ones, not worth the price double",2
3,"This electric shaver is nice for the price. It provides a decently close shave and you can get it as wet as you like. Battery life is decent too, I'd say you get about solid 8 minutes of maximum RPM's.<br /><br />The beard trimmer is not up to par. I find that it often tugs on my facial hair which is quite uncomfortable. There have been a few times when the shaver has burned my face as well.<br /><br />That aside, you aren't going to do much better for the price. The Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro shaver will provide a decently close shave for the fraction of the cost when compared to higher end electric shavers. If you're like me and you don't always shave every morning and require a beard trimmer, you will definitely want to purchase a separate beard trimmer. I recommend the [[ASIN:B000FED5DU Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System]] if you're looking for the full package.",2
3,A lil Cheap...,2
3,The short vs extensions. I got light brown and it was like a chese nut color. Matches perfect. Looks good feels pretty good. Sheds a lot and gets kinda frizzy but you get what you pay for. stays in well too,2
3,"I bought this after I had a keratin straightening done, but it doesn't do much more than any other anti-friz or pre flat ironing spray does that you can find anywhere.",2
3,"The consistancy is too thick. Shaves great the first time with a brand new razor only. Regardless of how often you rinse the blade the oil will build up on the razor rendering it useless. Alternatively, the oil can be used as a pleasant sented moisturizer.",2
3,"***updated from a second order, Amazon wont let me change my rating***  ***The second order of these had no cushion on the tips, completely unusable to me.  Guess I will have to pay the exorbitant price for the name brand.  Better safe than sorry.   ***Not as good as the name brand, but better than some others i had bought that didnt have the cushion on the ends.  These had some rough spots on them, but i smoothed them with an emery board.  It took of some of the finish, but at least they dont snag in my hair.  I love this type of pin, it works SO WELL in my waist length hair.  I can use 3 of them and my hair stays in a bun all day.",2
3.0,"Not a useful as I had hoped. It has slots for tips/tubes to shape - no one in this industry uses non-bagged and sterile items, so why have foam slots for them? Case is smaller than I thought, but also only has foam on one side for one machine. I ended up ripping the foam out and making my own custom setup.",2
3,"I love the scent of papaya and expected this cleanser to smell like it, but it smelled soapy. Is a good facial cleanser though. Would recommend for others to try,",2
3,Much smaller than I had hoped for.,2
3,I have olive skin and this color was too light.  It looked like I was trying to be a Kabuki dancer.,2
3,too small but it does the job I just wish it would be a little bit bigger. other than that it was ok,2
3,"This doesn't really exfoliate the skin, there is not enough granules in it to be a scrub. More like a shower jell.",2
3,This trimmer works okay. It's made a little different than I thought in that there is only one little blade on the side. It seems to do an okay job for the price. It doesn't pull or tug at nose hairs when you are trying to trim.,2
3,"This white armpit cream has the best smell ever! i got two cream. The container are small good size to carry around. Travel size. The cream is light pinkishes. Is fabulous. it protects the skin from pigmentation and dark spot. To be honest, i only use it with my hand. It is extremely heavy and thick to apply any where else in my face. I prefer not use any where  else because this product is is not fda approve nor made in usa it is made in thailand. Dont get me WRONG! what i like this product is the smell. The smell is so great. It stated use twice daily! I use once a day only if i dont have another lotion or cream around..  Is just too thick heavy and greasy",2
3,I have found that the heating wire in these tips do not last long.  They either break or the alignment of the wire moves away from where it is suppose to stay.,2
3,"I like this wig and the seller seems extremely nice :) But there are 3 main reasons why i didn't give this 5 stars.<br />1: The wig head itself is extremely small. i don't have a large head by any means and the top of it barely fits, i<br />always keep tightening my head bands.<br />2: This wig also sheds extremely easily when you brush it, but the plus side is the hair lays nicely once its done shedding :p<br />3:The black part is not evenly dyed, there is only like a chunk of black in the front on one side and the rest is red. Its not evenly dyed.<br />but if you can overlook these three things i think you will fall in love with this wig!",2
3,"I was using Oz's Super Youth moisturizer, along with their Vitamin C serum, and loved the results so much, I passed both products on to my daughter, who has adult acne issues.  She also loves both products, feels they've helped her skin.  I then ordered another Vitamin C serum for myself and Oz's Sea Infused Herbal Moisturizer.  I don't like this product as much because it feels sticky on my fingers, seems to leave a film on my skin that 's sticky at first, but gets better in a few minutes.  (I actually thought the product had separated and so tried shaking it like crazy, but that made no difference.)  I still love their product line, but will definitely go back to the Super Youth moisturizer when it's time to reorder.  That product made my face feel fresh and clean, seemed to improve the tone of my skin.<br /><br />This moisturizer is brown and has a earthy smell--all of which I like because it makes me feel I'm using a very natural product.  The list of ingredients confirms that wonderful fact.",2
3,"Loved this waxing kit. Got all my hairs out at one time. Bought this kit too save myself some money from going to get professionally every couple weeks. Works great. Wax cools kind of fast, just be prepared  to reheat a few times.",2
3.0,Just can't see that this has helped me in any way.,2
3,"I haven't used it long enough to know if it works (about a month now).  I will tell you that the bottles weigh too much.<br />Being a senior citizen, it's very difficult.",2
3,"You just blow chalk dust out of the front it seems like and it has a shiny metallic piece of plastic on the end to make other light around you seem like it's lit by reflection. Scares people around you for a second, but as they really look at it, they know it's not a real cigarette.",2
3,this product smells amazing and does absorb right away but after a few hours my skin actually felt dry all over,2
3,Wasn't exactly what I was hoping for but it is okay.And a little hard to do by yourself the first time.,2
3.0,"I am not overly impressed with this diffuser. It has a low reservoir capacity at 80 ML (this should be added to the product description and specifications). It also has a much lower vapor output than the other 2 diffusers I own. They're both much less expensive more generic diffusers and so I expected a better performance out of this more expensive diffuser. If you're more concerned with the way it looks and modern design, this product may be perfect for you. It does look a lot nicer than similar products, but I HATE that they've screen-printed their logo CROOKED across the front. They couldn't even bother to get the logo straight. It is crooked and this drives me insane. Guess I'll need to diffuse a few more &#34;tranquility&#34; oils with this one.<br /><br />Overall, I would not purchase again for the same price. It is a good looking unit, but why doesn't it perform as well as cheaper ones?",2
3,"This is a very useful product.  It did have a problem, the color was way darker than ite photo showed.  I would not purchase it agaun",2
3.0,It a hair ribbon.  Not a lot to say.,2
3,These are not exactly the same shade as the ones I have gotten from the manufacturer.  They work well for bleach before and after shades.,2
3,"Been having on and off issues with the skin on my face this winter, so I bought this thinking no matter what was going on with my skin this sounded like a very soothing type of product. Well, very much to the contrary this cream really aggravated the hell out of my skin and frankly I was shocked. However, since using it I went to the dermatologist and found out that I have Rosacea ... so if you have Rosacea, this may also aggravate your condition. Otherwise, I have been using it on my arms and legs to help with typical wintery dryness. When it's gone, I highly doubt I will repurchase.",2
3,"Just like the Mangroomer back shaver the quality is very cheap and not rechargeable, the protective carry case it comes with is a joke. But for the price it does what it says.",2
3,Does the job,2
3,The Ultimate Body Applicator. disappointed in the size of te wraps. Had to use two to do the area I did.,2
3,I bought these because I was looking for the BEST. so sick of cheap Chinese clippers.  They don't have that awesome clean crisp feel that I expected.,2
3,"It feels very refreshing and minty, but it doesn't keep my face feeling fresh.",2
3,"WE ORDERED THIS PRODUCT IN JANUARY AFTER HAVING TRIED IT ON MY SON'S ECZEMA BACK HOME IN THE PHILIPPINES. I WOULD SAY THE PRODUCT DID WORK WELL AS MY SON'S CONDITION IMPROVED . HOWEVER ON MY SECOND ORDER (ORDERED 2 JARS W/C COMES W/ FREE SOAP AND MOISTURIZER)WE DIDN'T RECEIVED THE PACKAGE . I CALLED UP THEIR SUPPORT LINE AND WAS TOLD THAT USPS ALREADY DELIVERED IT. AFTER GOING BACK AND FORTH(FREEDERM AND USPS)WITHOUT OFFERING MUCH HELP, WE FINALLY GAVE UP. DISGUSTED FOR PAYING $59.90 FOR NOTHING, WE  DECIDED TO LOOK FOR OTHER CREAM. RIGHT NOW WE'RE USING ECZANA(NO STEROID) AND ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS.",2
3,"My local drugstore stopped carrying my regular Lineur Intense Felt Tip liner (which has a tapered felt brush that's long and &#34;whippy&#34; like a calligrapher's brush and which makes lovely wings at the corners of my eyes each time) so I tried this one instead.<br /><br />The pros: This gives very saturated coverage and the tip (also felt but shorter than the Lineur Intense brush), is flexible enough for fine control, but not too thick/brushlike like some liquid applicators. You can draw VERY fine lines, which I really like.<br /><br />The cons: This gives me massively, unacceptably smudgy raccoon eyes. And it's really hard to wash off.<br /><br />I'm SO bummed bc I really did like the applicator, but for some reason this just migrates down into the dark areas and creases under my eyes. It's weird because the liner above my lashes seems to be holding up well and not flaking, yet somehow it's turning up beneath my eyes. I've tried with and without primer, over eyeshadow, under eyeshadow, with setting powder & not, etc., and now I think I may just have to give up. It's also crazy stubborn about being washed off ... I'm starting to get a little worried about the delicate skin under my eyes and the longevity of my eyelashes, what with all the rubbing and patting I've had to do.<br /><br />Alas, I'll just have to go back to the regular Lineur Intense felt tip. Happily Amazon carries it, too.",2
3,Too few,2
3,I didnt get it yet their were complications with my family but they were very understanding very good job yes,2
3,"These are very hard to find.  Would have loved the product more if the shipping and handling costs weren't so expensive.  It wasn't even mailed in a box, just a padded manila envelope.",2
3,"This is the first cruelty free hairspray I have tried. I have always used \\""super hold\\"" hairspray. I tried the Super Hold Aubrey Natural hairspray, and it was like hair glue. I decided to try the regular hold.<br /><br />First of all, this hairspray smell SOOOO good. I feel like I have just left the salon. This hairspray is very light, especially, when comparing to the superhold. I had to spray a couple more times to get the hold that I want. I don't mind that the regular hold is much more lighter than I had expected.<br /><br />I used this for a few days. I notice that when I used this hairspray, throughout the day, the skin where I part my hair would start to itch. My skin seemed to itch A LOT more than the \\""superhold\\"" version, and it could be because with the superhold, I only had to use 1 pump, versus with the regular hold, I used 3-4 pumps. I skipped it one day and used another hairspray, and no itching. I tried it again, and my skin would itch again. It's embarrassing when I could be having a conversation with my co-worker, and I would start scratching my head.<br /><br />I gave the superhold bottle to my co-worker who has very curly hair, and she uses it like hair gel, spraying it on her hand and then applying it onto her hair. When I mentioned the itching to my co-worker , and she commented that she did notice little bums around her hairline, but her skin isn't itchy. I also gave this regular hold bottle to her daughter. I will see if she has either the itching or the bumps reaction.<br /><br />My search for cruelty free hairspray continues...<br /><br />I recommend pricing around for a lower price. I got mine at Vitacost, and they have the best prices on many products.",2
3,"This product worked, but I had to use it twice and the second time it caused two small holes in my upper lip, which I am guessing was irritation from having to use the product twice. I will use the rest of the product but will not buy again. If you have sensitive skin, I do not reccomend this product.",2
3.0,Looooooove,2
3,"I love the scent of the tea tree peppermint shampoo and conditioner by OGX and was excited to find that they also made a lotion. The lotion is creamy and silky, but you can barely smell the scent, which is disappointing.",2

3,Every pretty but not great quality.,2
3.0,"Hair type: 4c (natural)<br /><br />Hair density: thin-med.<br /><br />Hair diameter: fine<br /><br />Perhaps this works better on someone with a looser curl pattern, but this didn't do anything for me. I didn't notice any additional shine, sheen, or hold. It did leave my hair a bit softer, and I liked the fragrance, a light coconut (non chemical) smell. I won't buy again.",2
3,The product itself is amazing- it is very easy to use and gave me the wavy curls that i can't get using a regular curling iron. The only downfall was it arrived with the black spiral attachment broken off. I tried contacting the seller several times for a replacement but did not get a response. I ended up keeping it and realized you do not really need that part as a guide. It works just as good without it,2
3,It pulls out blackheads but the charcoal smell is really strong!  it also took a long time to be shipped.,2
3.0,"A few of the bristles were missing, but overall a good product.",2
3,"It's not as blue as I thought it would be, more like a bluish putty...",2
3,I like the hold.I dislike that it leaves a white residue around my edges. It's not oily so thats a good thing.,2
3,The scent is very strong. The scent doesn't last all day. It doesn't smell the same as the product sold in the retail stores. Kind of disappointed. I saved money but get the same scent.,2
3,"I have not used it enough to decide. I did use it once and it us very sticky not sure it made much difference on my hair,  but i am willing to try it again.",2
3,"This soap is just ok. One of the main reasons I purchased the soap was due to the scent, but it doesn't really smell like pumpkin at all. In fact the scent is so faint is doesn't smell like much of anything. I won't buy again.",2
3,"The soap itself is very good, lathers nicely and is easy to apply, however the smell isn't that good (airplane soap) and it leaves a residue on everything it touches and once you wipe off your face your skin it very dry.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",2
3,"I have suffered with severe acne all through HS and into my early 20's.  Long story short- My face , for the most part, was finally CLEAR.  I decided to buy this cream to get rid of my acne scars that I have had since HS. This cream is very thick- same consistency as vaseline. It made my face feel very very smooth, BUT I broke out like crazy!! And still, 2 months later, I have still not been able to completely clear my face up again.  I've been using the cream on my legs and dry skin until it's gone because it was expensive and I don't want to waste it. SO, if you have sensitive skin and are prone to breakouts I DO NOT recommend this for your face.  If your going to use it as a skin cream- lube up! It leaves your skin feeling extra hydrated and smooth!",2
3,"I bought this light hoping to do my gel manicures as home, and for the price I can't really complain to much. It works, just not to my preference. My complaints are, you can't fit your entire hand in it, and the curing time takes quite a while. 1 min for the base coat 2 minutes to cure each layer of color, 1 minute for the top coat. multiply that by three (one for each hand and once for your thumbs) and you are at 18 minutes of drying time alone! I have a child so that's just a bit to long to do a gel manicure when you add in buffing and painting time. Someone please correct me if im wrong, otherwise I will be purchasing a different LED light soon.",2
3,"I received a sample of this last year in another DermaE product I had ordered, but only recently got around to trying it when I was on vacation.  After using it for a few days, I had to order a full bottle as soon as we got home.  It has such a lovely vanilla scent to it and is so creamy and lovely to use that I feel like I'm having a mini-spa experience each time I use it.<br /><br />It also does a nice job of removing makeup, although I always use a toner at night to feel completely clean.<br /><br />I haven't yet tried it with my Clarisonic since it's so creamy that I'm worried it'll make mess, but on its own it's great.<br /><br />Great product!<br /><br />UPDATE ON 1/8/12:  I originally gave this product five starts, but just downgraded my review to three stars.  While I still love the actual face wash, I've had problems with how it gets dispensed.  You're supposed to shake the bottle before each use, but the product is so creamy and thick that it doesn't shake up and the pump is always getting clogged.  It's become such a pain to use that I've basically stopped using it.  I would purchase this again if they change the way that the product is stored, but, for now, I won't continue using it.",2
3,"I can't say how well this product works yet, have used it once and not with the skin products it came with.  However I do want to point out to every one that although it says \\""rotary\\"" its pad does not spin, it only vibates.

3.0,"Pros:<br /><br />Very quick and easy to operate.<br />Nice that a brush was included and fits within a pocket in the base of the razor<br />Did a good job on my cheeks, chin and under my nose<br />The batteries lasted a long time, once I got beyond the initial set provided with the razor (which only lasted about a week)<br />Very convenient when camping out of a tent<br />The trimmer was effective, though I didn't use it much<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Over time, the razor left long hairs on my neck. No amount of back and forth would remove them. The hairs got longer and more numerous over time. Eventually, I used a conventional double bladed razor to remove them.",2
3,"It was pretty, and it served its purpose. However, it was kind of uncomfortable, and heavy, and hard to bend. I used it like a normal headband, when I wore it for prom. I'm probably never going to wear it again",2
3,"Average. doesnt work any better than other products.  Slow to whiten, and only slight results seen.  It is thicker than other products.",2
3,"This product has little odor or taste which is a good thing.  It does the job as far as relieving dry, chapped lips.  The one drawback is that it is a bit stiff which makes it difficult to feel as though enough has been applied.",2
3,"The makeup is okay as far as color and coverage, but the brush is not really that useful.  I still have to use a sponge or my fingers to blend it well.  I'm not sure how much waste of the product there will be with the twist up dispensing either.  I haven't noticed a &#34;lift&#34; with this product, but it is very creamy.",2
3,Like the smell and it is supposed to be really good for you hair and skin.<br />Conditioner wouldn't come out of the container.  Tried several things but it wouldn't budge.,2
3,"as it says on the bottle, it dries very fast. but it peels!!! I work very hard on my nail art and the very next day it will completely peel off.",2
3,"I bought it after seeing a commercial for it.  They were using it on their faces.  Of course, when you get it, it warns several times that you shouldn't use it on your face.  That was the major point.  I haven't gotten past the point that you are using it three or four times a week to say whether its really worth it or not.  It also makes this smell, which I showered afterwards so it shouldn't have been a big deal, but I could smell that smell off and on the first time I used it.  I'm not sure I can recommend it.  Its small and the instructions are easy to follow.  It is a little difficult to get a constant green light over knees and ankles.  I go over and over the same area.  Its definitely faster to use a razor, but eventually I shouldn't need to be using it as often.  Who knows how long that will take though.",2
3,"This is the first shaving set I've owned, and it is great for a starter kit.  The brush is a little bit cheap, a couple of the bristles fall out each time I use it, but not so much that it's going to be unusable any time soon.  I'm not an expert on shaving soaps either, but the scent is nothing great.  I'd like to try something else out, like almond or sandalwood.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to someone just starting out, but it definitely would not impress someone who has been DE shaving for while.",2
3,Good brush but not even close to as big as it looks. it's rather small,2

3.0,"I'm glad I waited to write this review. Let me start by explaining my skin. I'm 41, have large pores, combination skin, and lots of redness and some broken capillaries. I can't remember leaving the house without foundation since I had my kids and my face turned really red. So I was really surprised at how well this product worked for me. On my fair skintone it almost looks like I have on no makeup. My skin in no way looks perfect now but looks about 50% better than with no makeup. However, after using this product I became suspicious after getting a few pimples at my age which I am not prone to. I have been using this for about 2 months now and can safely say it is the bb cream that is causing this. If you are prone to breakouts this is probably not a good product for you. Also since I have been using this my face looks somehow \\""older.\\""  So unfortunately since this is not good for my skin I won't be buying this again. I will be trying out other bb creams since I did have nice results with the product otherwise.",2
3,"I received the Mia as a Christmas gift and I love to use it in the shower. I do have one concern though and you who are reading this and thinking about buying one should know: when you charge it (and you're supposed to for 24hrs upon first use)it MAKES NOISE.  It makes a small, pulsing, chirping noise like a cricket.  This may not be a problem for those of you with big houses where you can plug it in to charge somewhere far away from where you are, say, trying to sleep.  But if you have an apartment and don't have that option, argh! Annoying. Otherwise, it is a good product (I just don't know why they thought it would be a good idea to have it chirp annoyingly while it is charging).",2
3.0,Smaller than I had thought but works well.,2
3,this handbag is better in the picture than in person. the model is nice but material is really poor. it's too shiny and the crocodile skin is not embossed.,2

I'm not convinced that it did.<br /><br />It also concerns me that there will be millions of batteries containing toxic waste to be disposed of when we can simply use a regular razor.  It's not like it's a strenuous task to shave without battery power.",2
3,It does the job and the price is great.  I am a little disappointed in the eye gel.  It does not work as well on puffiness as it should.,2
3,It is an &#34;ok&#34; product.  No more special than other Redken products.  It did nothing for my hair's occasional frizziness.,2
3,Soft scrubbing and makes my skin feel great,2
3,Too strong a fragrance and made me sneeze...I had to toss it.,2
3,"I think the kit itself is good. Bracing yourself to rip off your hair is kind of difficult, but once you get the hang it's ok (not everyone might be able to inflict waxing pain on themselves though, know what you're getting into!). I had an allergic reaction to the wax and my eyebrow was red for 3 days! The wax off wasn't great, I ended up using hawaiian tropic tanning oil to get the bits remaining. I think I may purchase another type of wax and try again.",2
3,I tried several types and this one is my favorite!  Smells nice and though a little pricey the best toner I've used that doesn't have harsh chemicals! UPDATE: 5/16/2017  Still love it but all to often it stops up and does not want to spray!,2
3,"Bristles are a bit too stiff for me, but I have fairly sensitive skin...",2
3,"For the most part. Its cheap, but you get what you pay for. Having to move wigs off the floor is a plus though.",2
3,"It leaves my skin feeling smooth, but I have not seen any significant difference. I took a before picture before I started using this cream, so I know it is not doing much. However I will give it a bit more time considering I have only been using it for two weeks and a half. I gave it a three because it makes my skin soft and I wasn't expecting a miracle in a bottle just something to help make my marks look less obvious. Best of luck to does who try it and i hope it helps",2
3.0,"This was ok, not as sticky as most lip stains, but the color didn't stay very long (pink rebellion).  Maybe it was just too light a shade",2
3,"The product are really good. I worried about the shipping costs, because I ordered 2 products, they were sent in one box, but for both the shipping costs were calculated seperately.",2
3,"My nose fits my face but it long, hooked at the end (it's easy on the eyes though, Lol!) and wide. I'm AA if that makes any difference...it shouldn't but for those who are wondering. Nevertheless, I paid under two bucks for both of these. No shipping and handling, no tax just under two dollars. It came quicker, weeks quicker, than it was supposed to. I give them a rating of five for that. These shaping clips are clearly for someone with a smaller nose. the blue one ALWAYS slowly, eases off of my nose. The pink one? Too tiny, can't do anything with it. They don't seem like they will break and will work for someone else, not for me. also, the directions are not in English...it's Asian. I gave it a three because of the price, speed of delivery and they are REALLY sturdy.",2
3,"Not the best brushes on the market, but they're good short-term. Bristles can be a bit hard, some aren't cut all the way with the others, and one brush... I don't even know with this thing, but I don't dare put it in my cosmetics.",2
3,"I really loved this trimmer until the battery started losing its charge.  Too bad you can't plug it in and use it (instead of just for charging.)  Unfortunately, it's been 3 years and it's lucky if it lasts 5min on one charge.  I'd love to give it 5 stars, but don't think using it once a week (app 150 times total) should be cause for a dead battery.",2
3,Great experience with seller and the item arrived ontime. I was surprised to learn that it came with an car for the iPhone and a screen cleaning cloth.<br />The only disappointment was that the strap held on by a chain broke the first time it was used.,2
3,"Good for the price. flexible but you have to trim them, but they get the job done with the right glue",2
3,"Thank goodness I got a tin of this wonderstuff before they sold out! Up until last week, I had been using a mix of equal parts Kool-Aid Cherry and (appropriately enough) Grape Tang. I think this stuff is much more color-fast, as I've been enjoying a vermillion vajay-jay for about 5 days now. On the other hand, my SO says this stuff doesn't taste nearly as good, so that might also have something to do with it. I think that balances out to 3 stars.",2
3,"Got this and the plastic tines in it hurt - a lot. There are just too many of them and they're very scratchy. I finally decided that there are just too many plastic 'bristle' pieces in it and snipped off every other one with some clippers. Now it works great, no problems, and not painful with normal brushing (just don't push down hard on it into your scalp, of course). Be sure to snip the plastic things off as close to the base of the brush as possible or they will still be scratchy.",2
3,I did not see results for this one bottle and i did it twice a day for two months.,2
3.0,This is a cool product that smells fantastic. The price here Is sad but I found mines at Walmart for 1.00.,2
3,"I have become a fan of the various \\""leave-in\\"" hair products that have become available to improve hair quality and manageability.  I have to rate this one by Suave,though, in the just \\""OK\\"" category.  The macadamia oil and white orchid qualities sound very appealing but this product did little to help my hair.  For a similar moderate to low priced product I prefer Pantene Pro-V Heat Shield HeatPotion Serum.  That product is currently just a bit more expensive on Amazon than this one by Suave.  The Pantene is priced as of the writing of this review  at $4.49 for 1.7 oz while the Suave is going for $6.99 for a 3 fluid ounce bottle.",2
3,"I find the end result of the Instyler to be very nice.  My naturally curly frizzy hair is straightened but bouncy unlike flat irons that leave my hair too straight and the ends looking pointy.    Instyler heats up very quickly, but start off on a lower setting than usual because it is VERY hot and it's not ceramic.  I use a a heat protectant as well as a drop of Frizz Ease on my ends.    Pros-  *I can straighten my thick frizzy hair faster vs a regular flat iron  *Bouncy, shiny hair    Cons-  *Annoying loud, my neighbor can hear it through our apartment walls (he thought I was drilling!)  *Hard to straighten roots  *Not Ceramic  *Dangerously hot, the shape of this makes it easy to be flimsy and fall. Be Careful! (Please don't have this around kids!)    My Verdict-    I'm pleased with it, but not in love with it.  I have it as an addition to my drawer of styling tools, I don't regret buying it but will not be buying another Instyler in the future.",2
3,"We recently purchased these L'Occitane - Winter Forest scents in a diffuser with the reeds. The fragrances are fantastic. Can't say enough good things about them. However, it seems the company wants to trick you into buying every accessory after figuring out you don't get what you need in the original order. And the descriptions don't tell you in advance. In this case I ordered this item of perfume to use as an occasional spray in the office when we'd have clients or guests coming in. I was floored to get the item today only to discover we now need to spend another 8-10 dollars plus shipping to get a bulb / sprayer that screws on top of this bottle. Nope, is has no sprayer on the bottle, just a screw cap. Yep. Con job. If it came with a sprayer or at a minimum we knew we needed to buy one, we would have ordered it at the same time and our rating would have been better. Again, great fragrance company, but they get you every which direction on the accessories to complete your order.",2
3,It leaves my hair feeling greasy and thick afterwards. On the other hand the shampoo and conditioner are AWESOME. I will be buying them more.,2
3,"This comb is very small, especially the handle.  A bit hard for someone with large hands (like me) to use.",2
3,"The foot files are much larger and heavier than expected. They work okay - I wanted the dual sided with a rougher sandpaper on one side and a smoother on the other. The &#34;smoother&#34; side is also quite rough, and the size makes it somewhat awkward for a woman's hands.",2
3.0,Great,2
3,"i have noticed that it dries my hair, definitely only use it once a week or once every 2....but my hair is brighter through the winter than would normally be.  I don't color my hair and i have long blonde hair down to my middle back.  i take good care of it, very little blowdrying or heat styling.  it very well could also be the condition of my water as i try all sorts of different hair products that tend to either work for a time and fizzle or they are just DOA because i have hard water.  price isn't bad because it will last you a while.  i still have yet to try the treatment that is included.  i will update my review when i get around to that.",2
3,It didn't show a tan as easily as most of the reviews stated.  The smell is better than most self tanners though.  I wish it had worked better.,2
3,Love the pump convenience but don't find it to be very moisturizing. But if you like this fragrance in a smaller bottles ou will love how easy the pump makes it.,2
3,The only problem I had with this mascara is the fibers get in your eyes. I wear contacts and when I took the contacts out they had the fibers from the mascara all over them.,2
3,Had HIGH hopes for this &#34;stain&#34; but really let down. The reason I have it 3 stars was the exquisite color and appearance when it is put on meticulously. It's gorgeous! Then u go about normally and not even one full hour and ur wiping it off cuz it's a mess already. Not even stained lips like other cheaper products I've used. I have pale lips and need something on them all the time that's why I buy stains but let down. I want to use it everyday but don't cuz I know how hard it is to put on and then have to fix constantly :(  so I guess if u are constantly looking in the mirror and have the time to reapply you will LOVE this!,2
3,"Came partially broken, but mostly intact.",2
3.0,They are pretty colors but very small.,2
3.0,I like it but the smell does not last that long on you,2
3,"I have no experience with heat and shine sprays, so I can't compare them to others or even evaluate it on its own merits. This will take time and experience.",2
3,"I have thin and fine hair.  I tried this conditioner, as well as the same type of shampoo  [[ASIN:B00AAIOP44 Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Frizz Control Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]]. This particular product is just not a good match for my hair type. Even after thoroughly rinsing, I could feel a greasy residue in my hair and on my scalp. I only used this conditioner for 2 days, and my hair looked limp and greasy both days. On the 3rd day, I used a clarifying shampoo to finally rid myself of the residue from both the shampoo and the conditioner. This product would probably be better suited to a person with thicker, coarser hair than my own.",2
3,This product came quick and it was offered at a good price. I haven't yet tried it but a tanner with a good SPF is important for me. I would recommend this product to others. I have used this banana boat in the past only it was an SPF 14. Good product!!,2
3,"Nice and strong brushes, I did not try it still, but from the packet look good. We will see later.",2
3,"Just okay. It doesn't have a lot of power, and the attachment falls off easily, but it is compact and eventually gets the job done.",2
3,And then at the end of the day it smells real musky and loses the fresh scent.  Gets gross when your man gets sweaty.,2
3,The spray was broken but I just exchanged at a store,2
3,"This is one of the products from the North American &#34;Royal&#34; production....not from Bermuda. (They operate under a license from Royal Bermuda). It is &#34;close&#34; but different, as all the American made versions of the Royal products seem to be. Yes, it's cheaper to buy here, but you may not get what you think you are getting. If you want &#34;the REAL THING&#34; then buy from their site, pay the difference (which is pretty significant), and get it shipped from Bermuda. If the difference in quality doesn't bother you, then this is &#34;close&#34;.",2
3,fits the purpose,2
3,Besides the horrible delivery method...which damaged the black colour...i use occassionally and love the colours...i am dark skinned so some doesnt show that well more recommeded for the fair skinned women,2
3,It was ok,2
3,"I loved the Stila Nicole color and as usual when I find a lipstick I love it always seems to be discontinued.  I was so happy to find the lipstick and I ordered 3.    they arrived less than a week later but to my surprise...it smelled and tasted a bit rancid....I think they have been around to long....oh well, I learned my lesson.",2
3,"I got this product in may of last year, and as i saw for the first few months it was a miracle product! i gave some to and recommended it to some of my friends and they love it! All was well until about a month ago...  My skin had started getting oily (never was before!!! at all...) and my pores were huge! there was random red dicoloration and my skin just did not look healthy.... I used it once a day in the shower and i sleep in a coffin like way with my face up  for my hair etc.) I mean this product was great until the last month. Two months ago it would have gotten a perfect rating. I ordered the Queen helene Mint Julepe masque and that is really nice and after using it my skin was not oily at all the next day! (not to mention the other benefits, pore tightening etc.)  And i do think it stopped cleaning my acne aswell, i had numerous blackheads and more than the usual pimples. very strange to say the least.  I dont know if this has happened to other people but i just wanted people to know that this can happen and that your skin develops a tolerance to products!!  good luck!",2
3,These are pigmented enough. I do not have a lot to compare with them though. They are very easily smudged.,2
3,Its a nice lotion.. works really well I think. it just doesn't have a really good smell to it. Its more of a tanning lotion smell...,2
3,"Heavy, big and burned out within 10 months of light use.",2
3,"I had the Palmers cocoa butter formula in the little white tub which I love the scent of, so I thought Id buy the other products thinking theyd smell the same. WRONG. Its sort of similar but not nearly as delicious.",2
3,"They look kind of cheap/bright in person, but they stay in fine.",2
3,"For such a low price, this is a good product. They stay put and are very sticky.  And they are washable without falling apart",2
3,"The product itself was just simply okay, wasn't a fan of the smell either, it had that nasty after tan smell than i hate so much, it is pretty inexpensive however so i guess you get what you pay for.",2
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. THEY WERE DESCRIBED AS STRAIGHT BET WERE NOT.<br />THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY WERE NOT GOOD. I'M SURE THEY WERE VERY GOOD. JUST NOT 4 ME.,2
3,"Nice design, and good stainless steel feel to it.  Very good at cutting nail, for a clean cut.  Not great at getting in and clipping hang nails or the cuticle around the nail. Overall a good look and feel to the clippers themselves, I just want a more precision cut outside the nail itself.",2
3,I really like this cream. It feels good on and does not turn oily. I got my friend to use it and she loves it.,2
3,Too much money for what seems like an 'after shave'.  I thought it would be a little stronger than an after shave.,2
3.0,"I foolishly assumed when I ordered these feathers based on the product photo and description that I would be getting something at least vaguely similar. Boy, is my face red!<br /><br />If you're old-fashioned like me, and tend to assume that when you buy something on Amazon it's not unreasonable to expect it to actually LOOK like what you ordered, you may want to have a peek at the photo I uploaded. That's what you'll be getting if you order these feathers.<br /><br />Three stars because the feathers themselves are quite pretty. If you happen to be shopping for NATURAL-colored salon-quality feathers, you'll be happy with these.",2
3,"I like  using the OR MD product;it does make my gums feel better.  The periodontist did not say there was an improvement after I had been  using the product, but only that my gums were not any worse than before.  I guess that is good, kind of... However,beware.  When I started using the product as directed, I discovered that I had 4 small cavities at my next check up with the regular dentist..  On my old regimen, I had not had any cavities in literally years.  I have returned to supplementing  the ORA MD with some Fluoride gels and rinses to try to cut down on cavities  in the future, rather than using it exclusively like I was doing.  So  it does seem to make your gums more comfortable, but I would not trust it for cavity protection.[[ASIN:B009GMYACC OraMD 3-pack - Dentist Recommended Worldwide 100% Pure Mouthwash for Receding Gums]]",2
3,"In combination with a good brush technique and some real good hair spray it controls frizz (this is not what I intended to use it for). It smell like colon, cheap colon. It's ended up being a non waste of money since my husband uses it on his long golden locks of Thor",2
3,"I recommend using NOW Foods Sweet Almond Oil, Moisturizing Oil instead. It has a nutty smell, which is fine by me but the shipping and the price itself make it less attractive. You can find ti at your local Whole Foods (in NYC got to the Columbus Circle branch).",2
3,"[[ASIN:B0001IVKYG Helen of Troy Super Mega 1-1/2\\"" Professional Brush Iron]]<br /><br />I love the 1 1/2\\"" barrel size but am disappointed that the bristles are much too short and the curling iron brush takes much too long to heat up - it's very inconvenient and thus annoying to use.<br /><br />I would never buy this product except for the 1 1/2\\"" barrel size.",2
3,shipping came quite fast.  i was so excited to get the product but when i tried it.......I didn't get the same sense I felt when I used the Feria shimmering conditioner that comes in the Feria color treatment product.  It's definitely not the same product.  A little disappointed with the quality.,2
3,First Boar brush.  Its ok I like badger more.,2
3.0,"I've been using my clipper to trim and shave and got lazy of having to lug the whole kit out just to use it, so I bought this trimmer.<br /><br />It's a little hard to compare it because I've never used a trimmer before and so I'll be comparing it to my clipper.<br /><br />Obviously the clipper is more powerful, so the clipper gave a faster and cleaner trim vs the trimmer. The trimmer is smaller so it can get into places a clipper can't. Overall the trimmer does it's job, just don't have have expectations like the trimmers you see at the barbershop.<br /><br />It comes with a lot of combs attachments but they're pretty much within the same height range so it doesn't really make a difference from using one or the other.<br /><br />So far, the battery is great and probably the best feature of this trimmer. I have yet to charge the thing and I use about twice a week to shave my beard/face.<br /><br />I use the wider blade attachment so it'll be a quicker shave.<br /><br />Just like the previous commenter, the blades are already showing rust just from use.",2
3,Well it did work,2
3,Good produc,2
3,Hard to roll the ends of my hair in these curlers and they slip easily....doesn't hold curl all day.,2
3,"When my Clairol True Light Mirror (that I bought in the late 1970's) finally broke in 2010, I bought this mirror because it looked a lot like the Clairol one.  I was not disappointed at first.  The light was bright and the 5 mag mirror was perfect - not wavy at all. But after 4 years both lights burned out and they cannot be replaced. There are 4 slits on the back of my mirror, and no tool fits in them. So I ordered a second Jerdon mirror.  It arrived quickly. The light is bright, but the 5 mag mirror is so wavy it hurts my eyes to look at it.  And that is the side of the mirror I have been using lately. I tried to get used to it, but it really hurts my eyes.  It also has the 4 slits in the back, so the bulbs cannot be changed either. So I am returning it. I love the lighting on this mirror, but the 5 mag is fun house worthy!",2
3,"Did not see results right away, however my pores do seem to be smaller and that's a big plus. I'm not sure if it works as well  on dark skin as well as it does on light skin.",2
3,One stopped working after about a week but for the price they were ok,2
3,First time I see this product at Macys and found good  price at Amazon. I bought it. Its great product.I thought it is 24 hours active but could not see that impact. It is overall ok product.,2
3,The colors are nice but have a funny after taste,2
3,Not sure if it's infusing my hair with moisture but it does feel soft.  need pumps to dispense easiers,2
3,"This was good. However, I had breakouts on my forehead. I can only use a little on my hair.",2
3.0,Good but doesn't stay stick for long.,2

3,OK for the price.  must be disassembled to replace blade.,2
3,"I first smelled it in one of those magazine ads, and knew I had to have it. I love the smell straight out of the bottle. Its fresh, citrusy and clean smell is perfect for day time/work. I doused myself pretty heavily with it, and only 2-3 hours later, the scent was completely gone... a little sad about that, but it's still a wonderful smell.",2
3,"It really does work. The smell, and after rubbing it on made me fall asleep almost instantly. Wish it was less expensive",2
3,"so-so. it is very normal mask pack. it dosent have side effect or allege. however it doesn't have good effect too. i just feel it. and for man, it is little bit small than other. u can use facial cream if you are big face or if you need more mask.",2
3,"This product is &#34;just okay.&#34;  Next time, will plan to try fragrance at store prior to purchase.  Great pricing, however, makes it okay!",2
3,really moisturizing but the fragrance is slightly cloying. maybe a little bit more lemon or a little bit more vanilla would have made it perfect.,2
3,I'm satisfied with this cream.,2
3,"The clean, fresh, floral linden scent is exquisite; unfortunately, it's barely detectable after a couple of hours. If you don't mind fleeting pleasure - or reapplying - it is a nice, light, non-greasy lotion.",2
3,I purchased this product because it was so highly rated. I found that it worked well. I was disappointed that was a pump dispenser because it would distribute more product than I needed which meant that I used it up way too fast. Luckily you can screw off the top and get the remaining product out from the bottom of the container which is a good thing at $30 plus for .5 of an once. I would not buy it again because I think I can get the same results at half the price but it did work well.,2
3,a bit rough on the eyes,2
3,"I have been using the shaver for about two and half years.  This is the best electric shaver I have ever used, but the LCD display has a problem.  It breaks down every 4 or 5 months although the saver works fine.  I called Panasonic Customer service and they told me to send it for repairs.  I did not send it for repairs because I heard that they do not actually repair your shaver but send you another refurbished shaver, which I think is a very unhygienic practice.  I have found a simple solution to fix the problem - open the razor, remove the battery and let it dry overnight and then reassemble it.  It fixes the LCD display.  I think either overcharging, using it after the battery level is at 10% or moisture causes the LCD display to break down, although I never found any moisture inside the shaver.  I do not understand why Panasonic cannot fix this simple problem.  Except for the LCD issue I would have rated it 5 stars.",2
3,"the colors on this pallet are nice, but only dime sized. the pigmentation is not that great.  this might be good for a teenager.",2
3,I returned the iron since the light that indicates whether it was on or off was missing.  The iron was fine but not save without an on/off light indicator.,2
3,"this is not pink, it is peach, seller should state this in their remarks, this is lighter weight that the pink was.",2

3,The lip liners are more bright colors. Not soft pinks or reds. Very bright. If you like your lips to stand out. Theses are for you.Just to bright for me. I like softer pinks and reds. This like punk rock kinda look...,2
3,Just billi astringent is the same as toner.,2
3,"I really like this product, although I did find it to be expensive, plus the shipping makes it even more expensive.  I will try and find it elsewhere other than ordering it.",2
3,"* I like the silky feeling of the gel, but not sure how much it really helped to straighten my hair  * I liked it better for smoothing the hair.  * An ok buy.",2
3,"Product does tighten skin when you apply it; however, when moisturizer applied over it I am not sure how effective it is. I have been using product for several weeks with no noticeable results.",2
3.0,The colors are nice and I bought this mainly to experiment with color before spending a lot on individual lipsticks. They don't do well for long time wear and the lids do not stay on which resulted in pink lipstick on the inside fabric of my purse. Lesson learned but served my purpose fine for a decent price.,2
3,"Hey bought this peptide after hearing so much hype about copper peptides ,i received about 3 wks ago first thing i noticed when applying,is you can feel the immediate tightening effect ,i have also bought some other products alongside this one top of the range products from customer reviews on NCN website have informed me .so i am hoping to see reults soon .been told it can take a while to see any real effects ,i have noticed my dark circles are lighter and said b4 instant tightening effect which i soo need lol..<br />Ialso bought Emu OIl which acts as a carrier for the peptide incase its too strong at first as your skin takes time to adapt .<br />Like the idea of the EGF IN IT AS NO OTHER PEPTIDE has .<br />One thing to be aware of is the crippling taxes and fees you have to pay if you are ordering from the uk<br />Has put me off somewhat , the company is very professional in their dealings and as fast a delivery as poss from the states ,if you are serious about your skincare then you cant get any more serious than this .<br />GD LUCK ALL .",2
3,"It's a bottle,",2
3,"This product leaves the hair in the area treated sort of rough and stiff feeling even after dry. Can't really see any growth to the front or top, but I have not been using the product for that long yet. If good result, I will update review.",2
3,It also had Honey. My daughter gave me a tin of the &#34;old formula&#34; and before it ran out I wanted to find a substitute.  I think it works better than 'Traumeel'.  Now I wonder about the new formula.,2
3.0,smelled good but not very lathery,2
3,makes your skin look dewy but does not make makeup last longer...disappointing.,2
3,"Instead of getting 2 conditioners I got two shampoos... Also, the seal on the top of both bottles had a large hole in them, which made it difficult to squeeze the bottle without shampoo flying out both ends.<br />The shampoo was nice quality, but I wanted conditioner..",2
3,A little pricy!,2
3,"This was my original review:<br /><br />This is just alright.. honestly there are better products out there.. does not seem to have much effect in skin appearance. would not buy again.<br /><br />Reviewed (added a star)<br /><br />I started giving this cream another shot as a post peel moisturizer and I am liking it better now. Previously I had compared to the RoC Multi-Correxion 4-Zone Daily Moisturizer, SPF 30 and thought the Roc was better but I have changed my mind about that. The Roc makes my mixed skin look very greasy and shiny throughout the day in spite of make up, and this one also but much less. It also feel rich and nutritious for the skin.<br /><br />Still, will finish the bottel but probably not by again. Will continue searching for a day time high spf cream that does not make my face look shiny. I would def recommend for those with dry skin though.<br /><br />As far as the night cream goes, however, the Roc retinol is much better.",2
3,I purchased this based on reviews that said it wasn't as oily but I personally feel that it's still got to much oil in it.,2
3.0,"It's okay, not wonderful.",2
3,"It works fine but when I was cleaning it it fell out of the razor, the blades did. It is not very secure so keep an eye on it",2
3,great product.,2

3,"The product is really cute, and the padding it thick enough that I'm confident my computer is protected from minor bumps.  However, I have an 11.6 inch laptop and it's a very tight fit.  I honestly wasn't able to get my laptop in at first...I had to force-stretch it out for a day.  I can get it in now, but it's still not with ease.  I'm hoping that over time it'll stretch out more.",2
3,"Read reviews on this product, watched videos was impressed. Bought the product and was unimpressed. The quality just isn't as everyone ragged about. I was looking for that dewy look and after applying foundation there was nothing. It serves as a normal primer then. will not be purchasing this again.",2
3,"nice face cream, doesn't feel as creamy as I would expect for a night cream",2
3.0,"I bought into the hype but, I don't like how you have to clean it...kind of gross. If you think about how much bacteria stays in a kitchen sponge...eew...I couldn't get over how it couldn't be cleaned enough...the makeup went on flawlessly but, a nice brush can do the same and it is easier to clean.",2

3,It works but its definitely a little too thick. We were prepapred for a more to work with.,2
3.0,Okay,2
3,I put 6 to 8 drops each time I changes the bag and there was still some odor I just soaked bags in a antibacterial soap.works much better.,2
3,"We prefer natural products and use Everyday Shea body lotion for adults. I purchased the unscented baby variety at the local natural food store without testing it. Unfortunately, when we opened it at home, we were appalled at how terrible this unscented lotion smelled. It reeked of burning plastic and fresh tar, and the consistency was waxy and did not absorb well. This went straight back to the store. Even looking at it made me want to wretch.",2
3,I figured the eyelashes would look a little different but they're all the same exact size.  That's okay though because you can still make them look cute on your (or a friend's) car.,2
3.0,I don't like that fibers fall off my flashes onto my face.,2
3,"Not overly impressed.  Hair feels knotty after use, even with coordinating conditioner.  Will not purchase again.",2
3,I've only had this for a week but so far my nails do feel much harder and less bendable like before. My nails naturally grow slow now due to a bad nail salon experience in February but they are def. looking healthier than last week. Not using any polish and applying once every night before bed..so in 2 weeks i'll see the progress and hopefully give it more stars,2
3,"Color on internet is lighter than what's in the package, could have bought this in Target but thought it was too dark when I saw it.  Was looking for a light brown.  Otherwise it's fine.",2
3,"I love Deva Curl products and figured I'd try the hair spray, but I don't think I'd purchase it again without a sale and/or a coupon. It's not as flexible as I thought it would be and it's quite pricy compared to the other products, not lasting nearly as long as everything else. I'll stick with my $5 hair sprays from this point forward.",2
3,I bought this rolling cart for my art studio... It went together with ease. the rollers are good and strong so it rolls nicely. the trays are sturdy and roomy. It does have a bit of trouble going sideways because of its structure but all in all a quality buy for the money. i am happy with it and i feel it will last a good long while.,2
3,It wasn't bad,2
3.0,like it,2
3,"There was much less then I thought there would be, the containers are tiny and not even half full unfortunately.",2
3,"I LOVE the Salon Effects product. I don't even wait for them to grow out before I try something new. BUT, I don't wear glitter. Anything. Ever. I feel it is for younger people EXCLUSIVELY. Some may argue, but I think I'm right about this one. I LOVE the Sweet Tart-An argyle, but this one is glitter in the white/silver area. I wish they would put that in the descriptions. Anyhoo, just a heads-up",2
3,"I got Crest Pro Health HD to try free through BzzAgent.  It's the first two-step product I have tried.  I had just whitened my teeth with Crest Strips so they were looking pretty white before I started with this product.  I will say, this toothpaste has maintained my whitened teeth and I am a daily coffee drinker.  I was having to use the strips monthly.  My teeth felt very clean and smooth but I'm not sure that the benefits outweight the hassle of the two steps.  You have to use the first step for one minute and then spit but don't rinse and then use the second for the next minute.  I use this product with my Sonicare, which keeps track of my brushing time for me, but I think it's just a little bit of a hassle to have to use two products.  I'll continue to use this until it's empty, but I'm not sure I will buy again.  Time will tell.",2
3,Not good for nose trimming which is why I purchased.,2
3,Overpriced! Try Geo F Trumper Coconut for a great lather for sensitive skin.,2
3,Okay read the reviews thought this would be some great hair... WELL they got the virgin part right but its most def NOT Brazilian hair. the hair is very dry and matted OMG tangles so easily and this is just me UNPACKAGING and taking out of wrapping. im disappointed because i felt like i paid too much for this hair. but ill make what do and give another review after installation.. BUY AT OWN RISK. you get what you pay for...,2
3,Hurts too much! It works though.,2
3,"Not very powerful.  My feet aren't even that bad and the first roller is already worn out and I still have ragged areas. I love emjoi but have found I have to work with their most expensive product to get it to work, and I just  can't see that for the bottoms of my feet !!",2
3,My wife was expecting a compact in form of powder wich is not. It is like a hard cream instead.,2
3,"This color is natural looking; goes with everything. I did not give this polish 5 stars because unlike my other essie nailpolsihes, this chipped very easily. Otherwise than that the color is nice with an essie top coat of course.",2
3,"The necklace looks nice, and fits easily over the head without needing to uncouple the clasp.  However, the brown stain in the leather tends to leave brown stains on light-colored clothing.  I've stopped weatring it for that reason.  It won't be noticed with any dark-colored clothing.  I'm now looking for another necklace without stained leather, e.g., sterling silver.",2

3,"I previously used Obagi C RX and thought I'd try Obagi Nu Derm.  The Nu Derm was heavier and greasier, not what I wanted or expected.  I have normal to oily skin, so this product was not for me.  I do however LOVE the Obagi C Rx and will stick with it as my moisturizer and sunscreen.",2
3,Smells great.,2
3.0,The color is too light. Maybe should've bought the darker ones.,2
3,This snood is just OK....The pouch (snood) is very small and my hair just barley fits in it. If you have shoulder length hair it might be good but my hair goes half way down my back and it will not roll small enough to fit well.,2
3.0,"This works great but the only thing that really was a disappointment is the attachment that you change razors with has broken just a after a few months of owning, I had to duct tape it on so I can't switch the heads on it.  But other then that it works great and has a long charge on it too.",2
3,"Maybe it's just me but I couldn't get this down right. I'm not a heavy makeup wearer so this appealed to me cause of the brush shape, but it was too large for my eyelid. The shades of the eyeshadows are pretty, but all in all it's very overpriced.",2
3.0,Fabulous lashes for under $2. Quite uncomfortable and you have to use a stronger lash glue. Not recommended for everyday use.,2
3.0,"Not as heavy as material as my old one but holds all my stuff, probably won't last much more than a year, then I'll order a leather one.",2

3,"I have blonde hair that is wavie and slightly curlie - basically wild.  The 30 day treatment and application method works well after I wash my hair, apply and set with a hot hair iron. I follow the directions and keep my hair dry for at least 48 hours afterware. But the next time I wash my hair - with the Liquid Keratin Shampoo and condition with the Keratin conditioner, I have to straighten my hair all over again.  This leave-in conditioner helps a great deal. This keratin system reduces the waves but does not flatten them completely without the use of a hair iron after every shampoo.  It does eliminate the frizzies and after I straighten with the hair iron, it looks great!",2
3,"but the formulation seems to have changed.  Not as firm as it used to be, and went rancid sooner than expected.",2
3,They substituted Ultra-Lift daily targeted DEEP Wrinkly treatment INTENSIVE  for Ultra-Lift Daily Targeted Wrinkly Treatment.  They did not send what I ordered!,2
3,I tried it very several weeks but could not see any difference in the veins on sides of my nose or face.  I finally had them treated at the doctor's office.,2
3,I have fairly curly/frizzy hair and this product works ok. but the amount i have to use to keep my hair under control is more then i expected. i doubt this amount will last very long. I like that it does not have a super &#34;wet&#34; look like other products.,2
3,"Another typical 'cover-up' that's really just a typical thin makeup base. If your tattoo has thick outlining or dark colors, this will not do much for you.",2
3,"Used the product for 2 weeks everyday. I applied for an hour everyday after not seeing my teeth whitening but it had no effect, other than making my teeth sensitive.<br /><br />Do I recommend? Sure I do. Just because it didn't work for doesn't mean it won't work for everybody else.",2
3,I've used this radio in my shower for over a year and it works ok.  The battery is not very long for a small radio and the reception is touchy with the dial. And my radios clock doesn't stay on time for very long; probably due to shorter battery life.,2
3,The color is great.  Application is dry and difficult to create a nice line.,2
3,Not so good as I expected. I had no results. It's to expensive for what really is. Won't buy it again!,2
3.0,"Decided to purchase a Tweezerman's shaving brush based of other customers experiences.  Looked like a good product when it arrived; however, I noticed immediately after the first use it was shedding hairs like crazy.  Ended up returning it and buying one from Target since I needed it right then.<br />I may buy one in the future when I need a new one as I suspect I got a lemon.",2
3,Not my favorite scent but its smells pretty good. The DIesel I bought for my husband didn't smell very good at all.,2
3.0,It is good product if using a regular conditioner leaves the hair flat and gets oily faster. But I still need to put on some kind of product before styling for a little bit of moisture otherwise my hair looks to dry.,2
3,"Clippers can't be removed and start rusting, even after drying it once it's been rinsed after use. Charge keeps quite long. Although the stand is space friendly, the attachments keep popping out every time when I take out the razor. Somewhat cheaply made.",2
3,"Id need a whole day to watch video and learn the correct way to use this on my short,curly hair but perhaps if and when that day comes Ill find out its a wonderful product when I can allot 3 hours to do my hair-Im pretty sure my life wont go that way and if it does I probably have bigger problems than my hair.The few times Ive tried to use it it just doesnt work well on my hair but seems to be great for others-oh well.",2
3,"True to what they describe. Like them for what I bought them for, which is hiding a surgery shave which these will cover",2
3.0,"I purchased this fragrance in a trio set with Vanilla and Grapefruit Vanilla. This is the one I thought I would LOVE - in theory, it's right up my alley.<br /><br />I do think of all the fragrances, this one smells the most &#34;accurate&#34; - the two other fragrances have other notes that make them not-so-vanilla. BUT - the coconut here somehow smells synthetic, even though I believe this brand is all-natural. I smelled like I used a cheap body splash; it was also too sweet.<br /><br />I wouldn't say I don't recommend this - the packaging is cute, and the price is good - but I would advise that you try these fragrances in person to make sure they smell good to you, with your body chemistry.",2
3,"The product works well, and I like that it works hot or cold.  Some other masks cannot be heated.    There is also no bad \\""plastic\\"" smell.  I have used other masks in the past that had a strong \\""plastic\\"" smell that is not pleasant when you are trying to treat irritated sinuses.  This one has no bad smell and is pleasant to wear.    However, this mask only covers my eyes, and does not cover the area just above and below.  When I made my purchase, I could not tell this from the photos here on Amazon.  I wanted a mask that extends a little higher and lower to cover my entire sinus area.  I still use this mask, but I slide it up and down for brief periods to treat the whole area.    If you want a mask to soothe sinus irritation, or help with circles under eyes, I recommend you buy a mask that covers a larger area.  Other than that, this one works well and is available at a great price.",2
3,I think it tast pretty gross but after awhile you begin to get accostum to the taste. I take 1/3 cup a day for a month and have seen a significant improvement in my skin and hair growth. I would suggest the product and I'd also suggest you get 2-3 bottles like I mentiond I took 1/3 cup a day and it was gone within four weeks so save your self a little time ordering and just get 2 or 3 bottles at once,2
3,I have used jojoba oil around my eyes for years and it works fine.  I decided to change it up a little so I bought this cream.  I used it for a while but went back to jojoba oil.  I didn't see much change.  I actually noticed fine lines forming around my eyes while I used this cream.  Jojoba oil does the job for now!,2
3.0,"Pretty color, but I did not like how it feels on my lips, tend to feel dry so I use with Vaseline.",2
3,Did not work for me,2
3,i wouldnt get them again.,2
3,"I have very sensitive skin and have to watch what I put on it.  I bought this after reading the numerous positive reviews.  While it did not cause burning etc., I did find it to be quite greasy.  I thought maybe I had applied too much but the results were the same on the second try.  I also purchased a product called CeraVe Moisturizing Cream (through [...]) and liked that much better.",2
3,good,2
3,"I just received this package and immediately tested it out. They come in a sheer pink drawstring bag which is great for storing them altogether rather than a box that you would likely throw away.<br /><br />I soaked them all in water to inflate and dampen them, as you would with the original beauty blender. I automatically noticed the ones that are supposed to be dupes (the pink teardrop and the purple pear) were very firm and not that pliable. I could not squeeze them all the way down as you can with the original. Also, those who seemed to retain more water which I assumed would also absorb more makeup.<br /><br />The other two, the blue sculptor and the green sponge, are made out of a completely different material... similar to the texture and softness of the beauty blender but not as strong. I knew that automatically, the blue sculptor would be the best for application... if only if it had a pointed tip at the bottom - it actually might be better than the beauty blender.<br /><br />I did test out the blue and pink sponges. As I had already guessed, the blue sponge provided a better application but tore! Might you this is only minutes of me receiving them.<br /><br />I do like that there is a variety of sponges, so that's good but I think most of the women here are expecting the pink sponge to be more like the original but it isn't. The blue sponge is really good but needs to be a bit more durable.<br /><br />Hopefully I can get a few more uses out of that specific sponge but the others... I think I could pass. I was really hoping to like this a lot but it just isn't as good as it is hyped up to be.... it seems that this product is even rated higher than the beauty blenders which seems a bit odd.",2
3,"Pros:  Real badger hair, excellent price.  Cons:  The hairs fall out every single time you use it.  All in all, I would recommend this brush to anyone just starting out with wet shaving.  Maybe down the road go for an upgrade.",2
3,"I didn't really like the colors, they were FLAT and very dark. Just wasn't what I was looking for.  :)",2
3.0,"I have had bad gas all my life.  When I had my first colonoscopy 2 years ago, my blood prep work showed I have no lactose enzyme in my body so it doesn't matter what I eat, my gas will have you slain!  Then I ran across Devrom, read and researched then bought.  I take 6 per day and can say that it is partially effective.<br /><br />Depending on what I eat, it will work or not.  My gas can still smell after beans, eggs, fruit, and cheese.  A different smell, yet a smell just the same.  It still smells like a metallic fart from someones ass.<br /><br />I am determined to keep using it until i find something more natural because at least it is reducing the eggie farts of days gone by.",2
3,Check the ingredients in this with the ingredients in Listerine Whitening plus Fluoride Rinse. I was about to purchase this product at my local target due to the excellent reviews here. I was disturbed by the $6.50 cost for only 16oz. I also saw the Listerine which was 32oz for $6.50. I compared the ingredients of the two and realized that they were nearly the same. The same amount of Sodium Fluoride as a teeth strengthening agent and the same hydrogen peroxide as a whitening agent. Don't overpay simply for the brand and a cleverly marketed bottle. This stuff is simply too expensive.,2
3,"Bought smaller brushes but they are really too small.  Regular size too big, what can I say?",2
3,I've been using this concealer for years now and it works great for me. Does not cause skin irritation or breakouts and easy to apply. It covers light spots great but not darker spots so much. Only problem is you have to reapply it often as it comes right off.,2
3,"Smells nice. Very lemony, not much of the verbena. Ingredients do NOT list verbena, so probably not named accurately. Very rich. May buy again (still looking for a true lemon VERBENA that does not cost a fortune).",2
3.0,"The quality is great, but it would've been perfect if it was longer/taller, is too short.  The width is ok.",2
3,The smell of lard is rather disconcerting.,2
3,My hair stylist used this and I really liked my hair for the next 1-2 days. So I decided on buying this for myself. It's been sitting on my shelf for months and I've only used it 3-4 times. Only buy this if you know how to style your hair properly. It's a waste of money if you buy this just to have it at home thinking you can recreate styles like your stylist!,2
3,Had to buy it.  I am not totally convinced???? It does tighten skin a little bit but I dont think I would purchase again,2
3,"When I opened up the palette, the black was broken and had floated around onto the other colors. I think I got to it in time. I'm sure the other colors are fine but it pissed me off. Of all the ones to break and get into the pretty, light colors, the black one! Grrrr &#62;:I All the other reviews said things were broken - and it's true. It was packaged nicely though. The seller tried their best obviously.",2
3,I find it's a bit harsh on the skin around my eyes.,2
3,I really don't think it lives up to the hype but it isn't bad.  Goes on smoothly and I guess it has silicone in it because it leaves your skin silky looking but I didn't see any color at all.  It just looked like my skin smoother.  Not bad enough though to bother sending it back.,2
3,"I just thought that the cup holder was going to be a bit bigger, since there were so many reviews saying how spacious it was. I haven't used it to travel yet, so I just use the 'cap' side to hold my brushes since it has a bigger diameter.",2
3,"Im really into aroma therapy and this stuff doesn't really cut it. You have to use a good portion for it to actually smell. The smell is a mild soapy smell with some menthol. I dont think this \\""stress and tention\\"" stuff is any different than the \\""restless nights\\"" purple one.",2
3,"Don't recommend it for cutting a full head of hair. Ideal for trimming. Does not cut hair very well and the problem with cutting full head of hair with it is that the hair builds up very quickly in the plastic guard and then it's a pain to remove the hair. It just doesn't cut hair very well; you have to press down firmly and go over same spot multiple times. Again, can't recommend this for cutting full head of hair, just for trimming.",2
3,"I wouldn't buy this product again. I have been getting professional waxes for years and decided to save some money and wax my lip at home. It takes several tries for the strip to pull out the hair, and each go-round irritates my skin a bit more. The finishing oil is really nice, and it's convenient that, since the wax is already on the strip, there's no mess. It is a much cheaper option, of course, than going to the salon. But I plan to buy another product next time that will get the job done more efficiently and won't cause so much irritation.",2
3,"I bought this product to revitalize my nail polish. It worked well for this purpose, however the packaging broke after only one use. The rubber portion of the dropper broke down and ripped off. I had to transfer the product to another container. I will continue to use it for now but would probably not buy this again due to the packaging.",2
3,"The product is fantastic. However the expiration date is only two months away, I will probably not have time to use all the product before this date.",2
3,"The shaver per se is O.K., but the trimmer is located where it's almost impossible to use, and does not trim well at all. I have a Braun battery portable already, and was looking for one with a trimmer, but this one does not fit the bill.",2
3,Not really seeing much of a difference after using it a month. Too much static electricity.  Would not buy it again.,2
3,I was really excited to try this gloss and was a little dissapointed as its a little too expensive for what it does. Little too sticky but it works ok I guess.... It did ship fast which was a plus!,2
3,"The scent is a little over whelming at first. It does not shimmer as much as I thought it would. However, it does leave my skin soft.",2
3,"I didn't use this, it was for a gift so I can't give it a rating but the person I bought it for loves it.",2
3,"Very expensive. Nice aroma. Works OK.<br /><br />I am not sure if it is worth the money, but if that is not a concern, it is good enough.",2
3,Easy to work with,2
3,Ok...So I bought the MD Lash last year and I bought it from a Doctor...and it completely worked!!!!!!! My eyelashes grew really long! and People commented on them. When I ran out and saw that Amazon had it on sale for 70$...(which is half of what i paid from the drs office). I decided to buy it again! But for some reason...this time its not working! I am a little bit curious if there is a reason for that...especially since Amazon is selling it for half of the price that the doctors offices and actual MD Lash website is!!!!!!!!! Wonder if there is a difference in product???,2
3,For the price that you get them for and how many you get I'm okay with this purchase I will say they were really cheaply made and kinda looked and felt like plastic but I kinda wasn't surprised they were very cheap,2
3,"I just wish the strips weren't so narrow, with more makeup.",2
3.0,"THE UNIT IS GREAT.  WORKS VERY WELL AND IS KIND TO THE HAIR.  THE ROLLERS, HOWEVER ARE VERY MUCH OVERSIZED.  THE SMALL SHOULD BE MEDIUM, THE MEDIUM SHOULD BE LARGE,ETC.  I HAD TO PURCHASE CARUSO ROLLERS IN ORDER TO USE THE UNIT.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT VERY FEW HEADS ARE BIG ENOUGH TO ACCOMODATE VERY MANY ROLLERS AT ONCE BECAUSE THEY ARE OVER-SIZED.  JUST OFFER SOME SMALLER ROLLERS AND YOU WILL HAVE A 5 STAR PRODUCT.",2
3,Good,2
3,"So I love brushing my teeth with the sonicare. It cleans my teeth so much better than manual brushing that I will never go back and I doubt that any other electric toothbrush cleans as well, but I have not tried them all. I have run into a few problems, however.<br /><br />Despite the replacement heads being super expensive, and presumably of high quality, I have gotten more than one to begin to buzz very loudly while using it for only a week or so, and continue to do that for the remainder of their life. This would indicate something loose inside the head. It does not happen to all of them, hence, the heads are of lower quality than they should be.<br /><br />Problems: This design of the toothbrush (compared to e series) makes it nearly impossible to keep clean at the junction between the brush head and the handle at all times. When using the brush in the morning, sometimes, it sprays and aerosolizes this downright nauseatingly foul gunk all over my face, nose, and shirt. It happens in a split second and it is so gross it makes me gag. The solution is to try to be vigilant in keeping it clean, which I do. Alas, this still happens more regularly than it should. It's enough to make me stop using the toothbrush and switch back to manual for the day, or longer while I curse about how gross it smells, then clean it thoroughly and forgive it. You've been warned.",2
3,"It doesn't feel like this does much. If anything, I think it clogged my hair follicles more :/ I noticed an increase in dandruff and oil production on my scalp after using this product",2
3,"I've figured out that there is a difference between soaps and creams.<br />Soaps do put a very fine lather on the face, but not the thick foamy white that can be had from a cream.<br />Basically it accomplishes the same thing:  to lubricate the face, wet the whiskers, and protect the skin from razor burn.<br />It does a good job at that, and the lavender scent is not too strong, and doesn't linger if rinsed well and won't compete with cologne.<br />I was applying with a badger brush right in the bowl.  At that rate, I might guess this size bowl would easily last a year.",2
3,"I bought this pallet on the cheap because I'm just starting to experiment with make-up and colors. I didn't want to buy something expensive in case I hated it. When I first opened it I noticed some of the little pots were gone, but upon closer inspection I saw that they had just come unglued and were moved around. Since I've had it longer, more pots have come unglued. I'm not dissatisfied with this product, and I think it's a decent start for anyone that's like me. I'm just excited to know what colors work best with my face and eyes.",2
3,"Eh - its ok.  I have curly color treated hair.  This is not too expensive and I don't think its the worst thing out there, but I definitely don't think its the best.  This might be ok if you haven't abused your hair (like I unfortunately have). I prefer Alterna's leave-in overnight treatment.  That's what I'll be buying!",2
3,They were not as sharp as I expected.  They seem either old or pre-owned.  Could they have been old and gathered some moisture?,2
3.0,"These are a better deal than most of the other brands, but I would avoid the ones with fluoride on them.  You should be able to use a proxy brush several times, and the fluoride is gone after sticking it between a couple of teeth. I also didn't really like the flavor of it.<br /><br />To be fair, I wouldn't have ordered it if I'd noticed this had fluoride on the tips.",2
3,"I have been using this product for about 3 1/2 weeks.  I received it quickly and it was packed well.  I had read all the other rave reviews and decided to give it a try since I have been struggling with dandruff for a while now.  I have tried all the products you can get at the drugstore and also I've tried many expensive products.  This product is also by no means cheap.  I had expected the product to be watery since the other reviews had stated this, so I was not suprised when it was actually very watery.  The smell of the product is very different than any other shampoo I've used.  To me, it actually smells kind of like rum.  It's not bad, just different.  I like that the product using natural ingredients.    I haven't had very noticable results yet as far as dandruff goes.  The one thing that I do like about this product is the fact that it makes my hair less greasy.  If I'm too busy to wash my hair for one day, my hair doesn't get super icky like it did before.  I still have quite a bit of the bottle left so I'm going to continue to use it.  I will update my review if there anything changes.",2
3,"The color lasts longer than I thought it would! The smell is like green tea, kinda strong, but not displeasing. I like that it doesn't damage my hair and it covers my grey very well. A little goes a long way. So, yes, I'm satisfied with it.",2
3,It took some time to receive to the point where I forgot that I even order it. But they product wasn't for me it just doesn't work well with my skin complexion,2
3,"Good stuff, but always think B and B is overpriced....  Not really nice gift packaging.",2
3,Don't know yet.,2
3,"The brush was perfect in size and angle - but it only lasted 1 month before the bristles went in wild directions so the quality isn't there that I'd like. Not exactly long-lasting quality, I'm sorry to say.",2
3.0,"I've had Salon Effects nails in the past and they've been great, and these work, but they crack and start peeling off within about 2 days.",2
3,not large enough,2
3,Not enough product t's was a bit pricey. It did not look like a deluxe product . Please reduce the price,2
3.0,"I love the Tend Skin formula! It works great. I will say however, that I found the roller ball applicator to be ineffective. It seems like the liquid isn't thick enough to move the ball. Or not enough liquid is released, so when you roll over your skin the ball stays stationary and doesn't apply any liquid to your skin. You almost have to manually roll the ball with your finger. I'll try it out a couple more times. Maybe I'm using it wrong? Although it seems self explanatory. Anyway, I will keep using Tend Skin.",2
3,"Love the product itself!!!! I have very short bleach blonde hair and have dried it out soooo bad, my stylist recommend this product and it truly brought my hair back to life! As for the company selling it or the bottle that it is in, whenI recieved it half the bottle had leaked out! This large bottle would usually last me a month and a half ( with short fine hair and every other day use) I noticed the bottle felt lite.. when I pryed the top off there was a small hand full at the bottom ( I had just bought it 3 weeks ago) there is a hole where the conditioner had been leaking out!!! Very displeased with the bottle itself!",2
3,"I read all the reviews that is why I purchased these. They're okay, however I felt like they were ripping out my hair from the root. You kind have to tug on the scissors because they don't cut straight across. Screw was loose.",2
3,The scent wasn't exactly like Lily of the Valley.,2
3,"I was trying a substitute for gel polish and these are nice, the consistency and color are great, the shine from the top coat is just like gel polish. Only thing is it wears like regular polish, chipped by the next day and the shine becomes lackluster quickly.",2
3,"I've been using this for 2 weeks, but I skipped several days. I can't say it works or not, but I see the area I applied become so dry and my skin start to peel off. I guess that's the function of it? Or Cause I didn't use enough sun-screen? I'll keep testing this out.",2
3,Doesn't smell as overwhelming as the Righteous Butter or the Hand Food.  Left my skin soft-ish after the shower.  It's OK.  I guess it depends on your taste...Not buying in regular size.,2

I've only used it a handful of times and am tiered of my fingers hurting from the coarse hair.",2
3,Dryer is quiet and not too heavy. I can't give it more stars because there were basically no threads on the diffuser attachment so all it does is fall off. I'm going to permanently glue it on with something. This piece of the dryer is very poorly designed,2

What you get is 4 (or is it 5) little bottles that will shock you if you form an expectation based on the picture which looks like big bottles.  Also, i don't taste anything!??  Overall it's good in the end, not sticky or greasy and you get 2-3 applications per bottle so i guess it's a good value in the end.",2
3,"Sadly I have had fine, thin, oily blonde hair my entire life. In my younger years I longed for the flowing thick locks that I saw in hair product commercials-unfortunately it was not meant to be. Now as a senior citizen (albeit young in heart and mind), my hair is blond, white, fine, thin, and oily enough that I could literally wash it twice a day--no product seems to slow down the oil. Forget using combs, barrettes or hair ornaments they simply slide down to the ends and fall out because my hair is so soft and fine. Some products seemed to thicken my hair until the oil set in then they just made my head itchy. Enough of the gross details.<br />This product seems to make my hair thicker; it is still so soft that barrettes slide out, but it appears fuller. However if possible, my hair seems even oilier. I have only been using it for about 2 weeks, so I will continue until the bottle is empty and make my decision then whether to continue use or keep searching for the elusive perfect product.",2

I've used the blue and purple on my daughter and it lasted the appropriate amount of time (1-2 months). This red has been in her hair for 8 months!! Thank god I only did streaks but she's bored with it and wanted to try a new color like the lavender, only after reading the reviews on lavender and it turning green, I'm thinking NO. How do I get this out of hair without bleach or stripping it? Or will it eventually come out on it's own???? In the picture, the red had been in there for about 4 months......",2
3,"I bought this before our trip to Hawaii. We were planning on snorkeling so I wanted something safe for the environment and us. Most of the sunscreens with zinc oxide had a problem with going on too white and not being able to rub it in.  This is not the case with ThinkSport.  I goes on a little white but rubs in just fine. It did not feel greasy and when you go in the water you can see how it repels the water. The only complaint I had is that even by doing a thorough job of putting it on and reapplying every hour or so I still got burnt, and this was before I went in the water. With an SPF of 50 I thought it would work a little better.  One strange thing about the sunburn is that even though I looked quite red it didn't really hurt and within a couple of days it was a nice tanned color, no peeling either. Maybe the sun in Hawaii is very intense for this product, but would work just fine in other areas.",2
3,does not loof the same as on the opi chart for sure,2
3,"The item was much smaller than I'd expected, especially since it's labeled as a &#34;brooch&#34; and brooches are typically much larger in size.

This doesn't do that, but unfortunately, it just doesn't have much power to begin with.  There's just not a lot of oomph here, you have to make several passes over the same area to attempt a close trim, but it never does a stellar job.  I'm going to keep it for those emergencies when my rechargeable is dead or being finicky, but sadly, this is not the replacement I was hoping for.",2
3,i bought this as it was a &#34;better deal&#34; then the smaller &#34;tubes&#34; advertised on Amazon.  I didnt realize that it has some kind of top on it that you cant open.. no clue that it needs a special device? or something and i'm afraid to try and pry it as the can is pressurized. Wished the seller would have said something on the ad.. but then again.who knows as this might be how this larger cans are and registered hairstylists have someting to open/or whatever in their shops.. I have used hair colour and dyed my hair for years..but never encountered a &#34;can&#34; like this.. OH WELL.........,2

3,"This bag is cute and all, but it has an awefull toxic smell to it! I couldn't stand the smell! My whole house smells! I have been airing it out of 3 days now and the smell still hasn't gone away! Another thing, in the picture it looks like a pretty sturdy stiff material, its actually like a wobbly material. The inside lining of the bad is so cheap! No wonder they didn't post a picture of the inside! Its like some black rough plastic paper like material. I really don't know how to describe it. Cute bag, but that awefull smell I just can't stand it!",2

3,My Remington is pretty old. The plastic piece that is attached to the blades was too small for my razors input. I had to detach the old blades plastic piece and replace the plastic on the new razor with it. Works fine now. I'm happy with it.,2
3,"When i bought it, it was labeled as new, so i was expecting to find it with a seal, but unfortunatly it wasnt sealed and i have no waranty if someone used it before.",2
3,I had owned two of these before and got them from a rite aid store. I really liked those ones. They only lasted a couple years but I bought them for $10 each. The one I ordered from Amazon works ok for what it is but it can sometimes pull the hair and of course you can't get the close shave that you do with a razor but is ok for a quick go over. Just don't let your hair get too long in between shaves.,2
3,"I expected this to have more of an iridescent glow to it, but it was nothing more than a mineral powder with very minimal coverage. I'd say it's good for when you want to control shine on your face more than anything. There isn't any glow to this product at all what-so-ever. Good price for what it's worth, though.",2
3.0,"I used this as a non-burning aftershave, and it did perform nicely. My skin looked firmer, and I was able to avoid the Home Alone face that accompanies traditional alcohol based aftershaves. The three star rating is a direct reflection of my perceived value of the product. I found I got the same results with Thayers Rosewater Witch Hazel (which has a shockingly similar ingredient list) for a third of the price.",2
3,Two issues:  1.  Only 2 pressure settings.  The high is too hard; caused bleeding of gums.  I like the Waterpik that has continuous pressure setting.  2.  You need to keep the waterflosser vertical or it will not draw water to the pik.  Hard to do when you are reaching to the back of your mouth or sides on lower teeth.  Needed to readjust your hold to get water back. Annoying.  Both of these issues are not a problem with the counter mounted Waterpik.  Much better choice.,2

3,"it's almost perfect,  but I would take a way 2 stars for the package provided to me.  It didn't have a protect box.",2
3,It helps your hands but at a cost. The cr&egrave;me makes you and your surrounding area smell for a while.,2
3,I bought this groomer so i can groom my &#34;downstairs region&#34; but the size clips that go on it are a bit to sharp for my liking (Yikes!) It is good for facial trimming and all that jazz so its good in that way.,2
3,The clips I attach either cut my beard too close or not quite enough...  so that's my only complaint..  Nice looking trimmer.,2
3,"I was impressed with the delivery time.  The price was a lot cheaper than CVS or Rite Aid, when they have it in stock.",2
3,Wish they had more variety in color but overall I like the different shapes. The packaging was nice but some of the  rhinestones were mixed up. Overall its worth the purchase if u are a diy person like myself.,2
3.0,Wish it came in darker shade for suntanned legs.,2
3,"Maybe it's me and maybe I am just too thick haired but while they can get a clean shave they don't always do. I have changed the blades and still the same.

Which provides me a cleaner, yet more deadly shave.<br /><br />Maybe.<br /><br />PS: The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette",2

3,"All the other reviews I've read on AMAZON for this unit, listed before today (January 21, 2010) are accurate, and I love the unit as much as all the other consumers. BUT! Now ordering my FOURTH unit in just over two years, having two units fail within that time as described below. There is a major design / engineering flaw that makes the unit useless when it fails. I like the unit so much, because it has done wonders for my gums too, so, I have a back up unit ready and waiting when it breaks; just like it did this morning, halfway through my preventative maintenance. Just above the blue pause button on the handle, there is a convenient rotating knob to aim the water flow. And, just below that rotating knob, inside the handle, whatever holds it all together, breaks apart and the whole top falls off, along with the rotating knob. With my first unit, I glued the thing back together with some difficulty, while I was waiting for the second unit to arrive. It worked, but the restricted rotation (NONE) made it more difficult to aim into all the crevices, especially in the back of the teeth.    I hope WATER PIK reads this, or is already working on re-tooling / redesigning this very weak connection. I suppose they may get the point after so many are returned to them; I CAN\\""T BE THE ONLY ONE WHO IS HAVING THIS PROBLEM!?!",2
3,Very good,2
3,"I had tried a sample of the Eau de toilette and loved the smell. It lasted long enough so I thought buying the parfum will give me a longer lasting smell. Wrong I was! The smell is still nice, but it seems like this parfum is inferior to the toilette that I tried on. Very disappointed. The package says 77% volume, but that must be absolutely a lie. Though I recommend the smell (a lady asked me to wear it again...), I don't recommend buying it from this seller. Try it at a store and if it lasts long enough, buy it.",2
3.0,"Love China Glaze, and Iove textured polish, but these were sticky and thick. They didn't go on very well. I don't think they were old because the bottles or the display had &#34;New textured&#34; or similar wording.  They chip easily too.",2
3,"My husband got this for me. I initially wanted it because of the roll-on applicator and warmer in one, and then decided to try out the whole package with the other products. The package looks exactly like the one in the picture. It has the warmer with the docking stand, 3 roller heads, 3 wax cartridges with Deluxe Cream Formula, 100 strips, and four 4.9 oz lotions - 1 pre-epilation cleansing tonic, 1 wax residue cleaner, 1 post-epilation skin soother with aloe, and 1 skin nourisher.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- the warmer has 5 levels of heat controls - I leave it for 20 minutes on levels between 2 and 3 to get ready for application. That is also the recommendation on the instructions<br />- the docking stand also works fine - I am using it for several months already and it holds the warmer properly<br />- the things that I absolutely loved were the 4 lotions. I especially love the Aloe Skin Soother (the green one). It really calms the skin, and redness disappears within minutes. The Satin Smooth Skin Nourisher (the pink one) is also very good for the first couple of days after the epilation.<br />- another favorite is the strips. They are very easy to operate with, create no mess or fly-out fabric, and remove the whole wax; I now re-order them<br />- the roll-on wax application makes things much faster and convenient + the wax stays warm throughout the epilation<br /><br />Cons:<br />- the cartridges turned out to be smaller than I expected, and 1 cartridge is enough for 1 leg, so mind that when ordering them; also this means you will need additional time to heat the 2nd cartridge. So now I use another wax pot warmer (from Parissa) to warm my wax for the next refill of the cartridge while applying the first one.<br />- the whole system of warmer + cartridge + roll-on works OK only when the cartridge is completely full. After you have used some of the wax (which is after 5-6 stripes let's say) it stops rolling easily, and you have to hold it upside down for several seconds before each application so that the warm wax can reach the roller head and be able to apply. Which is inconvenient, although I got used to it already and got the knack of it - now I hold the applicator always upside down in one hand and operate the strips with the other, and as long as I don't need to use both hands to pull the strip, this works.<br />- another disadvantage is that the amount applied to the skin from the roller is not the thinnest possible which helps the already small cartridges to run out even more quickly.<br />- the wax itself was not good for me. I have very gentle skin, so this one caused a lot of redness after the epilation, and on the next day gave me a rash on my arms (something that I have gotten with other waxes as well, again my skin is very sensitive). So I will not be using the wax. But it may work for the majority of women out there.<br /><br />Overall I am happy with the purchase and use everything except the wax in it. I currently use the Satin Smooth warmer and fill the cartridges with the Moom sugar wax, since it is the only one that doesn't give me a rash. I use it with the Satin Smooth strips, and before and after epilation I use the Satin Smooth lotions. Due to the problems with the application that I mentioned earlier, I would recommend that you try some other roll-on kit if you have a chance.rm wax can reach the roller head and be able to apply.

3,"I was curious to try these out because I've really enjoyed other products from Ole Henriksen (The [[ASIN:B000A0ADUW Ole Henriksen Blue Black Berry Enzyme Facial Mask, 3.5 Fluid Ounce]] is a favorite and I also like [[ASIN:B000UO3GGQ Ole Henriksen Sheer Transformation Age Defence, 1.7 Fluid Ounce]].) so I was curious how the wipes would compare to the drug store brands of wipes I've previously tried.<br /><br />So far my feelings are mixed, at least for my skin type.  On the positive side, the cloth feels both substantial and soft on my face and appropriately saturated with cleanser.  It was moist enough to clean my whole face easily, but not so wet that it was sopping.  I also enjoy that unlike the [[ASIN:B001LFI8PC Aveeno Active Naturals Clear Complexion Daily Cleansing Pads, 28 Count]] these don't seem to leave any residue behind and don't require any rinsing.  I love it because it truly does save time and makes it a more convenient option when I need to clean my face on the go quickly, like at the gym.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the scent of these.  It's a very pungent orange vanilla scent that makes it much more perfumed than other wipes I've tried.  Of course, it means it also may not be the best option if you are sensitive to scented products.  (I think the [[ASIN:B00AO4EMKQ Simple Radiance Wipes, 25 Count]] are a great option if you are looking for something less scented as I really liked those as well.)<br /><br />As far as how well they work, I thought these did a good job of removing makeup.  But at times they did seem to sting my skin a little, but thankfully this didn't happen every time I used them.  (Though I do think the aforementioned Simple wipes are a tad better for sensitive skin.)  I also can't say that I've seen the benefits of the active ingredients in these wipes. I haven't exactly experienced any brightening, tightening, skin repair or any of the other benefits mentioned on the brand's website.  However, I certainly didn't expect to either.<br /><br />Overall I thought these were on par with the brands of wipes I've previously used and possibly like the Simple wipes a bit better since they seem gentler on sensitive skin.  However I do think the scent of these is really differentiating and makes them feel like more of a treat and could make them a great choice for people with normal/less sensitive skin.",2

At least, my previous shaver had some metal parts and had some real weight to it.  Anyhow, the shaving head speeds seem to be slower than usual, but for me, it gets the job done.  The trimmer is comparable with my previous one.  Finally, the water cleaning function is nice.  I would recommend this as a backup or travel shaver and just spend more for a top of the line shaver.",2

My old Panasonic used two permanently modified AAs from the factory, so this was no surprise.<br /><br />All in all, the lack of a beard trimmer and the throwaway nature of the product prevent me from giving a better review.

I was glad for the extra heads, because I found that after only 3 weeks I had worn one down already--so perhaps in the long run it will not be such a great deal.

If you're someone who enjoys rinsing their face in the morning, but feel some morning that you'd simply rather not feel the cold sting of the water, these are a great alternative. The biggest drawback for me though was that they make my face redden SIGNIFICANTLY. For this reason, I will continue looking for other wipes to use on my face, first from Burt's Bee's, but also from other brands.

If this product is to work for you, (if it works at all)  you have to give it time, not a few days or a few weeks.    With that being said...    - 23yr old  - male  - moderate thinning    I've been using this conditioner along with the shampoo for exactly 5 months now. I've used exactly as directed religiously since my hair lady recommended it. It's almost impossible to gage if i'm losing less (or more) hair in the shower -who can actually measure that?- get real.    Is my hair better than it would be if I hadn't used this product? Cant say.    Is my hair worse? Not that i'm aware of.    Did I maintain instead of losing more hair? Again, no definitive answer.    Did it fill in my thinning areas noticeably? No, I've started propecia.    Unless you're going to a hair specialist every few months and get hair samples/counts done it's really hard to tell if this product is working or not.    The shampoo used alone does make your hair thicker and more full looking. ESP if you blow dry after.    The conditioner+shampoo will leave your hair flatter than just the shampoo alone.    At best, you might grow a few hairs/maintain your hair/less hair fall.    At worst, you get a quality shampoo that will not damage/ make your scalp/hair worse because of harmful chemicals and additives.    The above has just been my experience and ive been as honest as possible because i know how devastating  hairloss is and i want to help people as much as possible.

3,"Plain and simple, I just could not get my face as clean with this as with using my own two fingers.  This is ok for me to to use with visible and above the skin pimples, but I just can't get out the deeper stuff with it.  I've taken some really steamy long showers to open my pores with not much better of a result than from a quick shower.  I suspect that maybe a facial sauna would really help, but that is just not something I am trying to buy.  This would be great if it worked for you, it just hasn't worked too well for me.  Its cheap enough to give it a try.",2
3,"It recieved a sample and upon smelling it I was immediately hooked. It has a very pronouned scent of ginger and citrus with a soft tone of cardomon. Very classy without being pretentious or ostentatious. If you are looking a good first impression, by all means this is the one!My only and probably most outstanding issue is that it doesnt last long. Ugh  For that amount of $$$$ I'm paying I'd like for my fragrance to last more than an hour.  Seriously it only last a very short time, but it smells so damn good.",2
3,"I want to be so in love with this product. I have fair skin and the color corrects perfectly to my tone. I can't believe how much product is in the package. Only half a pump is enough to cover the whole face + neck. There is no smell to it (something I prefer) and the coverage is light to medium, which is what BB's should be. This BB is much better than the U.S &#34;brands&#34; (which are just tinted moisturizers). The only problem is that it seems to break me out on my forehead and chin area. I used process of elimination for all my products, and unfortunately this is the culprit. Once I get my face back to normal I may try again. Or may end up trying Mischa B",2
3,"It does cut through a few days growth like it says in the description, but beyond that I'm fairly unimpressed. It does not shave as close as my old cheaper Braun single blade electric razor, and it chews up my face more. End result is less smooth, more irritated shave. I feel like 3 stars is a little generous for this product, but 2 stars is a little harsh, 2.5 stars is about where I stand on this.",2

3,would not purchase again.,2
3,These small bottles are not the ones from the hotel. Although they look identical the color of the lotion is kind of off white/beige whereas the ones from the hotels are clearly white. Also the smell is NOT the same. I think they have cheapened the formula and it feels more watered down. It's ok and wearable but it's not the same heavenly smell from the hotel bottles. I will finish off these and never buy them again. Very disappointed.,2

3,"This product would get a better review if it had a better bottle design. The product seems thicker than it did in previous years and it does a good job in moisturizing my very dry skin made worse in a dry climate. However, the bottle is very difficult to squeeze. My wrist actually hurts trying to get it out of the bottle. It has a pointed top so you can't put it upside down unless you have a shower tray that has a hole in it to hold the bottle upside down and then you have to lean it against the edge of the tray. Even with it upside down and the product ready to come out, you have to really squeeze hard. It is also so thick that there are blobs of it on the bottom of the shower that you have to make a concerted effort to get it to go down the drain. I have bought this product before but won't buy it again due to bottle design. I will ask my dermatologist for another recommendation.",2

3,"I really wanted to love this product but unfortunately it wasn't a cream like I thought. Its has more of a waxy texture than a cream. It smells good and fresh, but it is so hard to get a decent amount on my fingers to apply. I have to use it like you would a tin lip balm, but the amount that is transfered to my fingers isnt much. I tried applying it at night to my face (around nose and forehead area), but i gave up after realizing it would take forever to get a decent amount on. It is great as a cuticle cream, or for small rough patches though. I feel like it would be great to carry with me on family trips to have as emergency &#34;lotion&#34;.",2

3,Received quickly and comes with everything you need. It works great for trimming to stubble on my face and neck and love that it is waterproof. Do not however buy this if you plan on using to trim your head. I shave my head however sometimes I like to keep some stubble and this razor is almost impossible to get an even trim on your head.<br /><br />Overall if you plan on using this for anywhere except your head then I'd say it's a good buy otherwise look elsewhere.,2
3.0,This was a gift for my mom. When we gout it ti was broken in several places. We sent it back. They just need to do better packing next time. I might try to buy one again at some other time.,2
3,"I really loved the original 3 Step Acne System from Skin Essentials. I had used Proactiv in the past and this was definitely comparable for much cheaper. When I went back to Walgreens to buy another kit, it seemed they had come out with a new version: the Skin Essentials Acne Treatment System Severe. I tried it out. It seemed like the same products except they included a Retinol Renewal Complexs. I soon realized that something in the \\""new and improved\\"" version caused my face to swell and then start to peel as if I had a sun burn. I can't say if this new and improved version will help with acne as it caused me bad side effects but the older Three Step version worked great! I did notice that the Repair Lotion is now 10% Benzoyl Peroxide as opposed to the 2.5 that is used to be so that may have contributed to the swelling that I experienced.",2
3,Good,2
3,"I have been using this product for several months now and so far it has worked reasonably well.  Compared to dry shaving it is a substantial improvement.  It also lasts a lot longer than I expected.  I also bought the after shave which won't last as long, but I think that is due to the fact that I use too much (it only takes a dime-sized dollop).  The liquid is somewhat alcohol based so sometimes it can sting and it tastes horrible.  I know I am not supposed to drink/eat it, but it gets on your lips when shaving.  It does not leave any build-up on the razor and washes cleanly away.    The product is rather expensive which is offset by how long it lasts.  I am not getting great results which is why I downgraded to 3 stars.  To be fair, my skin is sensitive and the razor is also a component to the irritation I get, especially on my neck.  However, when my neck gets irritated, this product worsens the redness, bumps, and pain.    Lastly, the product is a liquid with the consistency of water and the nozzle on the bottle is like one for sun tan lotion.  It just sort of pours out and results in some wasted product and it's difficult to handle and apply.  I cup my hand and pour tiny bits and apply to my cheek, then my chin, then neck, then other cheek, and finally rub it all in.  The bottle would be better served with a pump spray or aerosol.",2
3,"The product stopped working after 2 weeks of use. The good thing is that customer service offered to replace it with a new one. The bottom line is that even though it may clean some of the food between the teeth, I still have to floss the old fashion way. The reason I gave it 3 stars is the customer service support the product comes with. Overall, I expected a lot from air floss, but I am a bit disappointed. I definitely did not expect this product to stop working after only 2 weeks. I hope the replacement will be better.",2
3,"I would not recommend this brush for use with setting powder unless you have very tiny areas that need setting. I don't know how that would be possible, though. If you contour around your nose, it might be good for that. It might also work for highlighting. I don't think it's worth getting, though, even as an add-on. If you get the Core Collection, which includes the contour brush, you wouldn't need this one. This one is about the same size and serves no unique purpose, in my opinion.",2
3.0,Scent wasn't as expected. Hard to spray; sprayer seems to be damaged.,2
3,"I used it the way everybody is saying to use it, gelous, color, gelous, color, top coat. I used this with a Sinful shine color, which is supposed to be a long lasting color to begin with. The polish lasted a few days before chipping. I am a bit disappointed because I expected the color to last at least a week before it started to chip.",2
3,I thought this would be more coral than pink.  It's okay but I won't wear it often.,2

3,The divider between big toe and other one is thick.,2
3,"Great color, but it created an allergic reaction making the edge of lips feel numb, so I trashed it. I would not purchase any more of this product.",2
3,"This is an effective mouth rinse. I am completely happy with its performance; however, its cool wintergreen flavor is gross.<br /><br />I was wondering, while rinsing, if toilet bowl cleaner would have a similar taste - not that I was going to try and find out. My only other wintergreen reference comes from a hard roll candy of which I am quite fond, and based on that reference, Crest's version of wintergreen is nothing near similar. Even without the roll candy reference, I would find the flavor of this Crest rinse displeasing.<br /><br />I do have a clean mouth after rinsing with Crest Pro-Health Cool Wintergreen, so aside from the flavor I can give it positive feedback in that regard.<br /><br />It all comes down to the flavor. Crest is probably okay on the \\""winter,\\"" but they sure could work on that \\""green.\\"" It is a four-star rinse with a two-star flavor - I shall average the two together for the product's overall score.",2
3,It does the job its meant to do but wasn't what I was looking for I thought the sharp tool would be sharper but it is duller then I expected.,2
3,"Sight-unseen purchases are always a risk, and in the case of the Body Toolz kit, I wish I had seen it before buying. The implements vary in quality, some seem really well-made and some feel really cheap. Good news: everything works, and the alignment of the cutting edges is accurate enough to get clean cuts. Some of the \\""scissor\\"" jointed tools bind but I think I can adjust and oil them to fix that. None of them have loose joints, which is nice.",2
3,"Not easy to apply, and darker than I expected.",2
3,"I have been using the Braun 790CC since 2008 and have always really liked that model.  About a month ago I was shopping for the replacement head for the 790CC when I came across the new Cooltec.  The trimmer on my 790CC was broke and I was also having problems with the cleaning unit so I decided to give the Cooltec shaver a try.  The cooling feature is really nice and it really does keep your skin cool.  The shave was alright, but it seemed to take forever and I would end up with a few razor bumps here and there.  I know this can happen as your neck adjusts to a different shaver so I kept at it for a month.  Well, after a month it did not get any better and the shave was just not as close as the 790CC.  I really wanted to keep it because the cool feature felt really good, but the shave was just not close enough and I was always left with the razor bumps.  So after a month I returned it and purchased the new 790CC.  I am really happy with the new 790CC...now if they could only add the Cooltec feature to the 790CC I think they would have the perfect shaver.",2

3,"I have used nearly the entire bottle of this product. I was hopefully that it would help my skin improve due to the raving reviews, but it falls flat for me. The toner feels wonderful going on after a shower, and it also has a slightly pleasant 'clean' scent. I've splashed it on my face and used it with a cotton ball. After an hour, my face is back to its usual oiliness. My breakout occurrence didn't improve but didn't worsen when I tried this. I was left wondering what it was really suppose to do for my skin since I didn't see or feel improvements other than initially using it. Disappointed, but it does still feel good to use. I guess my search continues for facial products that actually work for oily skin.",2
3,"For the price I cannot complain, but they are not the best quality.  They do not form very well in the molding process, but it was close enough to work.",2
3,"They service the purpose but don't stay sharp for very long. I can't complain about that, with the price. Thanks",2
3,I try it with Colortrak Cut and Fold Foil Dispenser and it works perfect.The only flaw is that the foil is to thin and it rips very easy when<br />you perform highlights.I wish colortrack had more thick and strong foil for professional use.,2
3,So far so good with this product. I would prefer a pump because it is easier to gauge how much to use. Feels great and it doesn't burn when applied around eye area.,2
3,I had to replace mine after only 6 months of use (not 18 months like instructions say) - it had large holes in the screen.  I called Braun (1-800-braun11) and they said the only way that happens is if you apply too much pressure when shaving (which I don't).  They will send a free replacement if you call though.,2
3,"the balm is not as soft as I expected it to be. Kind of hard to take it out and apply. I mean I am in a room of temp of 85 F.  In terms of effectiveness, I really can't tell, since it is so hard to apply more product onto my legs/feet.    I have another pregnancy oil product, and so I use that for my legs instead.",2
3,"This provides moderate coverage -- it's not as thick as the &#34;Clearing&#34; version of the same brand, and doesn't cover redness as well. It does smell pretty good, with a light floral scent. Overall, not a bad product, and I enjoy it for light everyday coverage.",2
3,"I've been 'waxing' for about 20 years.  At this stage, I'm mostly in occasional touch up mode for bikini area and underarms.  I started way back with Sweet Simplicity (which is still my favorite, unfortunately no longer available).  I've tried so many products, as well as professional waxing, so all this to say, I have quite a bit of product experience to compare these to.  Currently I prefer the GiGi home products, though I'm still looking for something better to replace it with.<br /><br />I bought Veet strips in a pinch, no other products available at the drug store. (I ran out of cloth strips to use with the Gigi and the stores don't seem to carry them stand-alone)<br /><br />Do they remove hair?  Yah... mostly.  sort of.  But not cleanly or completely, certainly not the most effective product I've tried, and the wax/sugar substance is a sticky mess to remove.  There aren't enough of the wipes included to do the cleanup job.  Baby oil and baby powder are a definite must-use following use of this product.<br /><br />I haven't tried them on my legs...perhaps that's the only area they're designed to work well with.  For a pre-waxed strip, I prefer the Parissa products.  Unfortunately also difficult to find in the stores.",2
3,Very nice product actually I felt I am in a spa when I use it because thats the way they do in spas. But the thing that I don't like about it the time it needs to arrive. It take very long time,2
3,"It didnt match my hair color, but GREAT customer service!!!!",2
3,"I had brought it for a cousin in India, and probably due to the diff in voltage out there, I didnt find it as good as I expected it to be. It is just an average product and the straightened hair does not last long.",2
3,I'm happy with the set for the most part with the exception of the larger blush brushes. They are too loose to use. But the smaller eye brushes are ok. All in all I don't think I would buy it again but I am still using the set I have.,2
3,I have the perfume and when I saw this I wanted to have a shower gel in this scent too. It doesn't smell exactly like the perfume.. it's a bit off and smells a bit 'chemical-y' in my opinion.,2

I've had it about 4 months now, after I started growing out my beard about 7 months ago.<br /><br />Plus:  Lots of different attachments; I particularly like the \\""wide\\"" and \\""narrow\\"" trimmer heads.  (\\""Narrow\\"" works pretty well around the mouth, for instance, but it would take too long on the rest of my full beard.)<br /><br />Plus:  Cordless/rechargeable, so there's no cord to maneuver around in use.<br /><br />Con:  The blades on the trimmer attachments did pretty well at first (first 2-3 months?).  Now they seem dull - they don't cut as well, and there's a lot more pulling.  Occasionally it'll pull out a hair entirely... if I wanted electrical tweezers, I'd have bought those instead.<br /><br />Con:  The battery doesn't last very well.  Another reviewer mentioned 15 minutes; I haven't timed it, but that sounds about right.  (I usually do a touch-up every couple days, with a more thorough mowing on Saturday morning.  It has to be fully charged to make it through the latter.)<br /><br />Good for:  Guys with lighter beards than mine, maybe?  Guys (or girls, apparently) who want to trim areas besides their face?<br /><br />I picked this up in a StuffMart because I wanted one fast and this sounded like the best/most flexible option.  It probably was, but I still regret buying it without doing the research to find a better model.",2
3,Beautiful razor with a very functional design. The quality of the shave continues to improve as I experiment with various settings. Has made shaving a very enjoyable experience!,2

I had a 20% of coupon at that big bed and bath store. It was 99.99 so I got a good deal. It is a solid hair dryer and solid made. Made in Italy. Good blow and not too hot means hair dries faster with less damage. With good technique can leave hair silky soft. Not as defrizzing as my Volare though. And it feels heavier to me. So my Volare will remain my baby. It is better than the Elchim 2001, the $300 T3,  $200 CHI and an FHI dryer that I tried. I have super long wavy hair, live in the Bay Area, and I don't get haircuts often enough, so I need the anti-frizz. Also I am not great at blowdrying hair so I need the idiot proof anti-frizzer.<br /><br />It is not as good as my Volare V2 by Babyliss with the Ferrari AC motor (paid $70 more for). That dryer is magic. That and the Italiabrava by Babyliss are the best hairdryers on the market!",2
3,its  ok  cute  thanks .,2
3,"I could really like this product, except I should probably have gotten a darker shade. I bought this for the first time a couple of weeks ago (at a local drug store) because I'm having trouble with dark circles under my eyes and haven't really found anything that solves that problem in a way that I'm totally satisfied with yet. This is the best thing I've tried so far. Contrary to some of the other reviewers, I found that the different colors were not at all just on the surface but (so far) seem to completely permeate the compact. There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of pigment to the green & pink, but I am tempted to chalk that up to the fact that this one is simply too light for me, and if I don't find that this issue as well as the one of generally too-faint coverage (which makes occasional touch-ups an absolute necessity) are resolved by buying a deeper shade of this product, I will include that & any other pertinent info in an update.<br /><br />I am using this product even though it is much too light for me, it does seem to blend pretty well with another powder I have that is somewhat too dark and has a tendency to look too &#34;heavy.&#34; So, in my case, two of my makeup purchasing mistakes seem to be cancelling each other out with pretty good results LOL ;)<br /><br />I absolutely do plan on purchasing this product again, only in the next darker shade.I am very fair and I normally purchase either the very lightest, or next to the very lightest shade of powders and concealers. However, from what I can see, this product is probably going to be pretty much useless for anyone but those ladies who are very, very advanced in beauty (as only ladies over about 70 or so years old have been able to achieve.) I tried it on a friend of mine who, if nekkid, could lean up against a freshly painted eggshell whilte wall and blend right in if she wasn't also a flaming ginger. Amazinly, this stuff was a bit too light for her as well.<br />Then, I tried it on my gorgeous 83 year old neighbor and viola! Perfection!

Also, I have noticed that this product seems to look and cover best when applied with a large powder or &#34;kabuki&#34; brush (how appropriate, amirite?) than it does when applied with the dumb little flat brush that comes with it or a powder puff. For precision appplication and coverage, such as under the eyes, use a medium-soft or a medium bristle eyeshadow brush (a really soft brush just gets it everywhere but where you want it and is an exercise in frustration more than anything else.)ear old neighbor and viola!

3,"The eye cream itself is okay, not that I've seen any miracles.  After half a dozen uses, it started acting like it was out of product.  I had to shake it and move the top around.  There is no way to open the thing, so if it quits dispensing, you're done--and it's way to expensive to be throwing out half a bottle of the formula.",2
3,"Ok, so these brushes are pretty good. They get the job done. I love the blush brushes and a few of the eye ones! Some of the eye brushes just don't cut it though. I end up using my finger sometimes or other brushes to apply my shadow. I also love that they're soft and super cute. (: other than that they are in good shape. Get Emmm!",2
3,i like the cafe color but the others are alright,2
3.0,"It definitely makes the skin soft and smooth.  I'm hoping it's the dry weather causing my current skin irritation and not this product, since I'd really like to continue using it.",2
3.0,"The colors are Nice. The pencil alone doesn't have quite enough pigment to show nicely but paired with it's liquid part, it does show up enough.  I personally don't care for the brush for the liquid liner because it's a bit harder to get a clean and precise line.  One of the brush ends broke while trying to dip it back in for more liquid so they aren't as durable as I wished but for the price and amount it came with I will make do.",2
3,works okay but dries skin,2
3,"I am begging this company to make this product with a pick end that is stiff enough to pick food out of the crushing face of molars.  If that were to happen , this would be the ultimate toothpick in a great container.  The brush side is easily the best brush I have used after having tried every brand I'm aware of.  As is, I'm not really sure what the pick is good for other than maybe tracing your gumline along your tooth.  That may be OK, but not when your molars are full of crushed food.",2
3,"It tangles and is a bit thin, but still works for cosplay.",2
3,"I got a trial size pack of the same products for free from an Arbonne consultant.  They came in plastic pouches with a rip/tear top.  I had never tried Arbonne and immediately fell in love with the products.  I didn't have enough $$ to buy the whole set right now, so bought this travel set, thinking it would be at least a little more product than the free sample.  It's not.<br /><br />I have to admit that the packaging in much better (screw tops keep the product from drying out), but you get just a sample.  It's great if you want to try it for the first time, but I would first recommend contacting an Arbonne consultant so you can get the same thing for free.  If you want them to travel or move around, this is your best bet since you can close up the containers.",2
3.0,Fast service but did not realize it was metal laminated on to plastic... But I don't find any problem with the nail file as it works well,2
3,"I purchased this thinking it would be like a face lotion with sunscreen (during pregnancy) but really it's just a thick, white sunscreen. You only need a little bit. I will definitely use it this summer but it does turn your face a bit white so I am hesitant to use it under makeup. It is really hard to find pregnancy-safe face lotion with SPF though.<br /><br />If you are looking for a facial sunscreen, this would be fine. I wouldn't recommend it as an everyday lotion under makeup.",2
3,Shea Butter is great but the containers were broken.,2
3,"I had bought the original Panasonic Facial Trimmer on a business trip to Asia about 12 years ago until my niece decided she wanted it for herself. I bought this to replace my original trimmer... It seem to have a lot of power (maybe cause it was new)<br />I do feel like the parts are very flimsy, the plastic head holding the blade seems like a lower grade plastic.<br />To change the size of the blade it was to change only one half of the blade and that whole thing looks very thin and flimsy.  The original I had the 2 blade size interlocks to the handle, so it was easy and very stable.<br />Not sure how long this will last me.... I hope as long as the original",2
3,"I like the matte look of the styling creme, my hair does not look greasy and wet. However, I need more hold for my thick and curly hair. By the end of the day my hair looks frizzy and my wife refers to it as my 'fro. I like the smell of this product, it smells fresh and clean but my hair product search continues.",2
3,For the price it is suitable with a solid plastic feel and otherwise unimpressive beard and mustache trimmer.  Noisy - the attachments with the one I purchased fit well except the five position guide. It is tight and adjust by sliding to the correct detent stops.  The base is a storage case only with a place that you can run the cord to connect the power adapter. Did I mention it is noisy.,2
3,"Great powder, but it doesn't have UV protection like it used to have.",2
3,"I have used other Elizabeth Arden products with much satisfaction, so when I needed a lotion with sunscreen, I thought I'd try this one out. It was very drying, which was disappointing.",2
3,"I haven't been to the dentist since I've started using the brush, but it seems to work alright.  However, it sucks through batteries like you wouldn't believe.  Don't expect to get more than a month of brushing from a set of AA batteries.",2
3.0,"This dry shampoo used to be my favorite. However, after trying other brands I realized it's not the best. In order to get a clean look in your hair you have to use a considerable amount of this bottle. Therefore it runs out very quickly and for the price it's not worth it. Many other dry shampoos require a lot less product to get your desired look and cost much less. So overall it's a good product but I wouldn't recommend it for the price and efficiency.",2
3,I couldnt WAIT to get this i the mail! Only to find out that it had been packaged weong or something because the phoenix is Not connected to the headband in anyway. Id usually say you get what you paid for but i cant even say that ! Smh,2
3,GOOD PRICE.........IF YOU REALLY WANT A FREEZE HOLD TRY THIS ONE. BETTER THAN MOST ON THE MARKET. WOULD RECOMMEND HIGHLY!,2
3,"I have been enjoying this product, but still need to get use to how to use them.  The quality of the brushes are fair.  These are not high quality, but works for my needs.",2
3,I have found that swishing hydrogen peroxide in my mouth for 30 seconds does about the same job...and it saves scads of money.,2
3,"actually the rating is for the design, not for the product. if you are ok with the pain then this is ok for you. efficient but painful.",2
3,"They do what there supposed to. But they do not stay stuck to your shoe. For the price I would purchase again if I was in need to find comfort for a pair of shoes I didn't have to wear often, say dressing up for a special occasion. But, not for everyday use.",2
3,There is a soothing effect but I did not see any change in eliminating the redness.,2
3,These are okay.  Next time I think I'll try a different brand.  I only get one use out of them.  When I take them out of my hair they always break so I never get to reuse them.  I've had some break while they are still in my hair.  Other brands I've tried I can usually reuse at least once or twice but not these.  Other than that they're okay.,2
3,"This  product is just okay ,  I  didnt  see  any improvement  with  my  skin  tone . I  will  not be ordering anymore .",2
3,"This stuff goes on nicely like a lotion and has a different smell than their regular stuff- its ok overall. I have sensitive skin and love Proraso's regular line of products but this white label &#34;sensitive skin&#34; line is too sensitive for me. I'll stick to the regular proraso pre/post shave cream which is awesome!<br /><br />SHAVING- let me save you years of trial and error: take a warm shower & wash your face with billy jealousy exfoliating facial cleanser, shave afterwards with a $50 Merkur safety razor handle with good blades (save $100's on mach 3 refills!), use a $20 Tweezerman badger hair shaving brush to apply taylor of old street bond (or proraso) shaving cream (you can let it set in a minute), shave WITH the grain DOWN, SLOWLY, SOFTLY (don't press hard- let the weight of the handle and sharp blade do the cutting), lastly rub on a fingertip of proraso pre/post shave cream while your face is still wet and let it dry! Say goodbye to razor bumps and ingrown hairs FOREVER! Trust me- I've tried dozens of pricey face washes, shaving creams, and after shaves over the last 4 years. If you don't want to commit so much money yet- order the pre/post shave proraso cream online, buy proraso shave cream online or at bath and body works (under their C.O. Bigelow label) then get the cheap single blade disposables (mach 3's are too aggressive) at a grocery store and you'll notice a difference overnight.",2
3,"This daily detoxifying scrub is ok.  You only need a small amount to wash your entire face, so the 5.0 oz container will last quite some time.  It has an extremely mild smell, which is important for me because I dislike most strong scents.  My face did feel clean after using it, and it didn't dry out my skin nearly as much as some cleansers I've tried.  However, after using if for about three weeks, I noticed an increase in acne.  I think for my skin, I'm better off using a product with salicylic acid.  But, if you don't have a problem with acne, I would certainly recommend this cleanser.",2
3,"I have super sensitive acne prone skin with rosacea. I love Eucerin's sensitive skin anti-wrinkle cream (both the day one with sunscreen and the night one without), so I gave this a try. However, it irritated my skin, making it red and itchy.",2
3,I purchased these brushes for my wife as soon as we unpacked them she was amaze of the quality and color. But a few days later the big pink brush came off the stick. So she was disappointed,2
3.0,"It works, but compared to another derma roller I have, this one sometimes makes tiny scratches on my skin. It's not like I'm rolling it real fast, but after using this, I always end up with some scratches.",2
3,"The cord's too short, the barrel's too short and the heat adjustment is in a bad place.  Why do designer's insist on putting the heat adjustment at the part of the handle you have to hold?<br /><br />It heats up quickly and holds my soft, fine hair long enough to get a decent curl.",2
3,"I purchased the Vera Wang Eau de Toilette for my daughter as a graduation present. She had begged for it for two years. I thought $50 was too expensive to merely play with. To me the scent was like pepper, citrus, and sweet; very light like a hint or a trace rather than being definite and evident. I didn't like it at all. But I'm not 17 and it was not for me. Did she like it? Who knows! It's designer. It's expensive. Perhaps the gift, the moment in time, the scent will lock in a pleasant memory for a little princess ready to step out into the big world.",2
3,I wanted to love this product as I continue the search for a hand lotion that truly hydrates without being greasy and doesn't require constant re-application. The scent is not strong which is good because I didn't find it pleasant.<br /><br />This lotion absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy feeling. Within an hour of application my hands felt tight and in want of another dose. I gamely kept it up but every time I washed my hands or a short time lapsed between uses my hands would feel tight and dry.<br /><br />There are other products with no scent that are more effective. Unfortunately I just did not find anything to recommend this product over another.,2
3,"Having issures with my hair breaking off from color treatments. Saw the reviews for this product and decided to give it a try. Was a little skeptical because of the price, but I figured what the heck. Have only been using it for a couple of weeks so I really can't comment on the effectiveness. Will comment back at a later date. Bought some for my girls so will see how it works for them as well.",2
3.0,"In spite of the picture above showing the head being held under a stream of water, the Remington R-3150 Flex 360 is NOT washable! I called Remington to confirm. Treating it as shown in the picture puts you at danger and can ruin the shaver.",2
3,I don't know it works or not. There has been no noticeable effect.,2
3,"The side that holds the brush is fine, works as intended.<br /><br />The side that holds the razor is a bit short. The razor balances precariously and the slightest bump sends the razor to the counter top or even worse, the floor.  If the prongs would have been made longer they would offer enough support to make the razor stable. Had I the ability to see this in the store, I'd have got a different product.<br /><br />The base could be a little wider and/or heavier. The stand does not fall over as it is, but a little more stability would be better.<br /><br />It works, its 20 bucks, still looking for something that will hold my razor and make coffee.",2
3,"I bought this brush and I like it I don't know is the pulsing is what removes the dirt and oil as much as the circular motion but it does work very well. I've had no issues with it at all. I do have issues with Sirius though.....I ordered two replacement brush heads and they showed delivered and I never got them. I contacted the post office and couldn't get anywhere with them because their the post office and customer service isn't there thing. I hit the contact seller button through Amazon twice to get in contact with Sirius to see if they could assist in finding the item. No response. So I finally hit the file a claim button and surprise surprise I got a message from Sirius. I know you would all think they then would be super helpful but no the message literally said \\""this shows delivered. Contact USPS\\"" really helpful right. You would thing an only online seller would be more helpful so now I still need new brush heads. Amazon however immediately issued me a refund which I'm grateful for. Guess I should have saved my money for a clarisonic.<br /><br />******update. Someone from customer service did get in contact with me and they put in an inquiry with post office. They received a message back that they did not know where the package was. The rep apologized and promised to send me out new brushes and a second set of brushes. It's been over a month....no new brushes and no answer to the follow up email I sent to customer service********",2
3,"I was looking for a ribbon-type floss that I used years ago, and I stumbled across this. It's good, very thick floss, but it's not in a ribbon shape.",2
3,I had an allergic reaction to the product but have seen others achieve good results.,2
3.0,"I really like this scent, but it's too strong, and too sweet for me.  If it were just a little on the lighter side, it'd be much better.",2
3,I use this product occasionally. it is effective but not great. It does have a funny smell that is not appealing,2
3,"Love the product, but the pump didn't work. Product is too expensive to waste.",2
3,smells like lemons.  I was expecting more of a flower smell.,2
3,This is my second bottle. I know this is safer than the products that use HQ but it does not work as well or as fast. Has a sweet smell and isn't greasy.,2
3,This wouldn't be my first choice bc I like light to medium coverage. This is more full coverage and applied more wet than I expected. This would be one I would use if my favorite foundation ran out,2
3,I used it as for aroma in bubble bath. About 10 drops are ok.  Too many drops would irritate my nose even when dropped into a bath tub full of water.,2
3,nice rods...,2
3,I like the color tones and the amount of items you get for the money.   Both brown shades are the same color. That was disappointing and they go on very light. Great set for during the day but it won't make a smokey eye suitable for night time.,2
3,"Barely foams, but it's probably a good product.  Just not for me. Didn't notice any &#34;curl enhancing&#34; when I used it.",2
3.0,Pretty expensive given its lightweight construction--I expected a far heavier gauge of metal for $20.  It is functional.,2
3,price of this product continued to rise,2
3,"I like the product and really like the pump and squirt top. However, after I received the product I noticed it was manufactured in China. China has poor manufacturing standards and I do not trust products manufactured there, for that reason I will not purchase this product again.",2
3,ehhhh . not again.,2
3.0,"Love how it covers, but once you put it on that's it don't try to spread it to blend it out. Under my eyes it creased...The applicator is soft and efficient; likewise a nice touch if you are like me and dislike sticking your nail in a pot of concealer. WARNING: Watch how many clicks you turn because you can send too much product into the sponge applicator and you can't twist it to make the product go back in the tube. I am a Clay 3 in Iman Luxury Radiance Liquid Foundation and I purchased the Clay colored concealer...it looks 3 shades lighter and isn't an exact match or close to my skin color. I will be sending this product back; however, I found the Iman Luxury Stick Foundation in Clay 4 works so much better as a concealer and highlight and you get a lot more product!",2
3,I had purchased a ceramic by Revelon and it worked ok but I thought this one would be better so I bought it. It worked about the same as the less expensive one. I like the style and case that comes with it but think the price is a bit much for what it is.,2
3,"Ok, but more of a white cream than a light lotion.",2
3,isn't the color pictured,2
3,I bought this as a gift for my daughter who loved it but after several months noticed that the scent seemed to shift to something not quite as wonderful. An expensive perfume should hold up better.,2
3,"It was not quite what I was expecting. I thought it would be more heavier, thicker. A picture is worth a thousand words, but seeing and touching is worth more.",2
3,"This is a decent cologne, it is long lasting, cheap, and it's a big bottle. The only problem is there are much better smelling colognes out there for only a little more. I would look around before buying this, either that or make sure you like the smell before buying",2
3,"Came broken.. if not, it would have been a great purchase... as expected.",2
3,"one of these five little ones leaked out .. maybe during delivery or in storage,, so I only got 4 .. fortunately the others are pretty good!",2
3,I absolutely love the product. It is creamy and blends very well. However when I received it the packaging was broken badly,2
3,The stamping kit is ok. The rubber stamper and the scraper doesn't work very well.  The stamps are fabulous though. My daughter enjoys them very much.,2
3,Ok.  Not great but better than a lot of the so-called thickening shampoos out there.  There is some thickening evident after using it but not a lot.  Hair feels great though.,2
3,It's ok. I expected the scents to last longer. It may be just me.,2
3,Ok Did not hold the curl for long in either my daughters or my hair. But easy to use and heats up fast.,2
3,"I purchased mine at a department store a few months ago at a close out sale.  For me the shaver has given quite a close shave, though I do have to pass by more than once.  One problem has been the battery's inability to hold a charge (3 to 4 shaves with a sudden stop when it runs out of charge. A Braun shaver I own goes for about a week between charges.  The other concern has been the need to replace a screen after too short a period of use. <br /> <br />Compared to the Braun, the Remington is noisier, provides a closer shave, less convenient in holding a charge, but more convenient in that the shaver itself can be plugged in to charge where the Braun requires a charging stand, and the Remington apparently goes through screens more quickly. <br />",2
3,I use to wear these perfume before when I was a teenage and it not the some but it a very good perfume.,2
3,"This product is good overall, but I really don't like the artificial smell of it. I think it would have been fine if it were fresh cucumber kind of smell or even unscented. Also, the peeling could get a little annoying at times especially around the eyebrows and also near my hair. Maybe I should just avoid those spots but then I always have blemishes near those spots and I would like to cover them.",2
3,"A little bigger than I thought they would be.  The handle being larger makes it easier to work with.  They're just ok, not great",2
3,NO AUTO SHUT OFF. Are you kidding me. Decent straightener but not as good or even comparable to a $150 ghd. Save your $40 and put it towards a ghd.,2
3,kept comming off the spout ....,2
3.0,Flimsy but gets the job done. Im a female adult and the head is slightly smaller than mine.,2
3,"I have heard so many people talk about these liners so i was so excited to try them out. When i opened my package, i saw many duplicates. 4 of the colors had duplicates. Also, 2 of my lip liners caps had come off and the silver eyeliner that came with it was sharpened to almost a nub and looked used. I however, love the plum and wine color and those are amazing. They stay on pretty well and look good with a variety of lipsticks. Maybe just dont buy it in this variety especially if you dont know if someone used it.",2
3,Great as a conditioner and if my hair was dyed I'm sure it would be wonderful.  Makes hair super soft.  I was just hoping to enhance my gray.,2
3,"I don't see it lightening spots at all, but I do like how it feels on my face, so I continue to use it.",2
3,"Great for cancer patients. As a cancer patient enduring chemotherapy, my skin has become sensitive. Luminess provides the ability to use varying amounts and skin matching. I really enjoy using this product.",2
3,"I like these nail plates and some of the designs are really cute, but I think this product is aimed more for younger girls. I thought it was a cool idea and they really are a lot of fun and just like the feather extension kit, it's something fun for girls to do at a slumber party. Another plus to this product is that it can seriously save you a lot of money from not having to get designs done at a nail salon, don't get me wrong, I love the nail salon, but it's nice to have the option of doing it yourself. I was looking through the set and I liked a lot of the designs, but I do wish some of them were bigger. My favorite thing was the spider web and animal print designs. I also liked the fact that it has a good variety of themes too. This has something for everyone and that's always a good thing!",2
3,"I saw the reviews said there was some chemically  smell....um, it was intensely strong.  I almost couldn't breathe the smell was so strong.  I question how &#34;natural&#34; it is with that smell, it's not just a stinky smell.  It's got a chemical smell that is putrid.  I bought two and mixed them so my hair wouldn't have a red tint and the color was lovely, but the price and the smell?  I won't be buying again.",2
3.0,"We like the idea of a wall mounted hair dryer and after our 15 year old ones started breaking down we ordered the newest version of our current hair dryers.<br />Likes: the way it stores in itself, and the night light,.<br />Dislikes: one unit did not have any mounting hardware, only two speed fan, the hand held cord is stingy in length .",2
3,"Nice.it is very soft and smooth.compare with other bath product,it is easy to be clean up by water..",2
3,While I love the idea and look of how this buns supposed to look the execution of it it pretty difficult especially if you have thin hair like myself. It makes it hard to try and cover the whole bun area also the getting hair to stay in with bobby pins is hard as they keep popping back out. I wish there was a better way to make a full ballerina bun.,2
3,"I buy a more expensive lemon oil that works for everything. I can apply it directly to my skin without a carrier oil with no reaction. This stuff burns me. I also use the more expensive oil to remove labels from bottles for crafting; however, this stuff couldn't remove the labels. It does smell nice, so I diffuse it. It is ok, depending on what you need it for.",2
3,The lighting is not the best. Or maybe it is just my older eyes!!  :),2
3.0,"This scarf is just ok, not big at all can only go around neck maybe once.",2
3.0,Chair back keeps falling back.  Doesn't stay in upright position.  And chair doesn't go up that high. Fast delivery though.,2
3,It wasn't exactly what I expected from this perfume.<br />Nothing exceptional<br />I won't be a buyer of this product again,2
3.0,I like it,2
3,"I think they're a little pricey for tweezers.  Not for sure how long they will do their job as I've only had it a few weeks. They are better than other tweezers I bought, but some hairs still slip through like drugstore tweezers. Even though they do well, I wouldn't spend that kind of money on them again....it's not like they're magic or anything:)",2
3,This set is nice.  One of my favorite perfumes is in the set and it's cheapest to buy this set than buying my favorite individually.  I'm not as fond as the other two scents.,2
3,"This product is good for deep conditioning, but does not give the same results as the original Salerm Wheat germ mask.  It definitely does smell better and that is the reason I bought it, but I was not that impressed with the results.  I have curly hair btw.  might work differently for straight hair.",2
3,"The wig came in early so that was great. It was very soft and did not have that &#34;wig shine&#34; to it but it is very thin. No matter how you place the hair, you can see the wig net in the back and it tangles and sheds very easily. It was ok and worked for the price i paid though.",2
3,"I purchased this clipper for my husband.  He said it does not cut as close as other clippers he's used.  It's decent, but not great!",2
3,These were a bit small for what I orginally wanted them for but I have found other uses for them.,2
3,"Not my favorite neutral palette, but it's nice. There are four matte and five shimmer shades. I haven't touched the two darker shades of the bottom three. The others, though, pair well for my very fair skin.",2
3,I do not understand idea of those pens. I only like price. I will not recommend it. It has not good quality of material.,2
3,"I tried this once, it was a gift from a friend. I like the way it cleans and smells.  works on me!",2
3,This product didn't really pluck out my hair...it cut off the hairs and that way i just didn't have the smooth feeling. It also takes a long time to get all of the hair removed--I was prepared for that but it just takes tooo long. I am just disappointed with this product-will probably returning it.,2
3,The title states that it comes with a &#34;leather pouch&#34; and It was a pouch that seems closer to thick vinyl material... and the Trimmer seems to pull more that cut the unwanted hairs.  I was thinking about taking the trimmer apart and &#34;hand&#34; sharpening the cutting teeth on it to see if it will cut a little more than grabbing the hair!!,2
3,"The color is perfect, I get a lot of compliments on it. I like the gloss part that goes over the top. What I do not like is how the color starts smearing and / or feathering after a few hours. I constantly have to stay on top of it to make sure it's not outside of lips or feathered off in the middle. I try to be as careful as possible. Do not eat anything with bread on it because it will be all over the bread. I bought this & a Maybelline (10 hour I believe) that does not have a glossy coat over the top, but is more of a chapstick that goes over the top. I like the Maybelline much better. I wish this product was made a little better. I even make sure that my lips are completely clean & use a brush to slough off any dead skin first. Makes no difference.",2
3,"There's very little to say about this. Neither I nor my sister found it very appealing (I gave it to her after I used it once and disliked it). It's overly scented, and underwhelming in either stimulating or calming as a soak for a bath. Skip it and go for one of the stress relievers.",2
3,"It's ok. I didn't feel anything difference after using this product.<br />After finishing this hand cream, I just want to try diffrent product.",2
3,"Have had this tool for a couple of years and it works very well drying and helping to avoid tangling, but the bottom area near the vent and cord has started cracking and seems as if it could be dangerous...not sure if I want to buy another one.",2
3,"I purchased this after a hair stylist used it on me. It is a great line and smells great. Now that I have been using it for some time, it feels like much of the other shampoos I use. I feel you can get the same type of outcome with regular shampoos.",2
3,"This was good for a while, it smoothed my fine partly straight/partly wavy hair into glass, but they changed the formula, and the product accumulation and strong smell eventually became too much for me. This product has way more stuff in it than the label reveals. I recommend Marrakesh X by Earthly Body instead.",2
3,"I just received this mask. Less than a minute from trying it on, one of the straps broke. Luckily, I was able to sew it back together.",2
3,"It smells great and made her hair very easy to comb through, however, it didn't kill a single thing!  I followed all instructions, and even after letting the solution sit on her head for 15 minutes, the lice were alive and kicking when combed out.  I was happy to use the non-toxic remedy but very diligent combing likely did much more to get rid of the lice than this product.  Also, the comb that was included lost teeth after the 2nd use, and my daughter's hair is pretty average in texture and thickness. One pro is it left her scalp quite healthy and even cleared up flaky patches of dandruff that she had prior to the lice.",2
3,"This is a nice travel shaver not nearly as good as the discontinued es4815s [[ASIN:B0009DT34W Panasonic ES4815S Pro Curve Compact Mens Shaver With Double Blades, Blue/Silver]] which I reviewed, or the Braun P70 [[ASIN:B00007M9SU Braun PocketGo P-70 Men's Shaver]]. But, if you want a large trimmer, this is the one to get. The 4815 has no trimmer, and the Braun has a very small one. All of these are amazingly practical if you have a good set of NIMH (nickel metal hydride), modern/no memory, batteries and charger [[ASIN:B000XSBVMU Duracell Value Charger With 4AA Pre Charged Rechargeable Nimh Batteries, CEF14DX4N]]",2
3,"Nice scent but I got sick of it quick.  Sweet. If you like smelling like candy, get this.",2
3,"They are nice brushes, they're soft and fairly good quality the only down side to thus set is that they are very small!! They also had a slight smell but not too bad. These would be great if the foundation & powder brushes were larger.... no one's face is that small lol except my 2 yr old.",2
3.0,Not bad.  Not overly awesome. I'm not sure if I really see this doing much of anything for my hair.,2
3.0,"I followed the instructions in the Curly Girl book and DVD video to the letter. The Deva Clips did add lift/volume to the hair at the crown of my head and along my part. Even though I removed the clips carefully they still snagged and broke off strands of my hair. It is very fine. I am afraid that with continued use the damage would be significant. Would probably work on coarser hair. I find the pixie curl diffuser method to be more effective for medium length, curly, fine hair.",2
3,It takes more effort to shave the chest. Also the nose piece does not work to perfection. The face shave piece useless. Its best to use this product for hair shave.,2
3.0,It's ok.  Don't really use it.  I don't like how it feels on the face.,2
3,fits perfect does not come with blade,2
3,"I love the name of this product, White Chocolate Moose.  But out of the 3 Fizzmos I tried, this one's scent is the least pleasant.  It doesn't smell like chocolate, white or otherwise.",2
3.0,It could use more instructions on use.,2
3,"This did not do as much for my hair as I had planned.<br />Also, shipping took a long time. There are other wella products that are<br />better for me that this one Will not order again.",2
3,These ails are very thin and are not sparkled at all. I was really disappointed. And the glue is not included. But besides there being no glitter I like the look of the nails,2
3,I'm not sure what it's made out of but the lipstick makes my lips tingle. It's weird. But I love the color!,2
3,"I wasn't quite sure if I should give this face wash 3 or 4 stars but settled on 3. The good things about this product are<br /><br />1. It doesn't break me out.<br />2. It doesn't dry out my skin.<br />3. It doesn't make my skin oilier.<br />4. It has mild fresh scent, a bit like J&J baby powder/lotion.<br /><br />Aside from those, I don't feel like this product does anything special. It doesn't make my skin smoother or my pores smaller or dry out my pimples. I have really oily skin and I don't feel like this face wash help control my face oil like it claims. My skin also feels a little weird after washing. It feels clean but not squeaky clean but more like a waxy clean. If I run my fingers over my skin they just sorta stick there instead of glide over. This goes away after I tone and moisturize my face though.<br /><br />I don't think I'd buy it again but I do recommend trying it out since skin care products work different for everyone.<br /><br />P.S. I'm an 23 year old Asian with oily skin. I do get occasional breakouts around that time of time of the months (1, 2 pimples) but my skin is normal otherwise (no rosacea or sensitivity to anything).",2
3,VERY GOOD,2
3,"I really wanted to love this product after reading all the reviews, but after using as a face/body wash with a little tea trea oil for 4 months i recently found that coconut oil highly comedogenic(pore clogging).  So i would not recommend as a face wash for people with sensitvie and acne prone skin.  After about a week of stopping use and switching back to an oil free gentle facewash my skin is much calmer and the really dry and really oily combination is much more even with fewer breakouts (I am still using tea tree oil in a toner form).  I will still try to use the rest of my bottle to make a kitchen and bathroom cleaner, so maybe it will work better for other purposes.  Still love that it is organic and I hope to get rid of the chemical irritants in cleaning products.",2
3,For me this hairdryer is a little heavy and takes longer to dry my hair than I expected. It's just okay.,2
3,"Its my 3rd use of the machine its true its painless, althought I burned myself 2 times, it burns de hair but not from the root so its not a clean shave, Its supposed to take a while to see real results on hair density, I havent stared on my bikini area yet I'm hoping for the best but still no great results. It saids that you need time so im giving it more time. for now its no great thing.",2
3,This was ok b/c I didn't pay attention to the dimensions.  It's really small!,2
3,this is a great scent I had seen it for years on the tv shopping network...so i thought i would give it a try...and it smells great...but it dosen't last...for the price the scent should last a lot longer,2
3,It's hard to sleep on side with the pad .Wont buy it again,2
3,"the praline color is beautiful, but I definitely found the formula to be a bit drying. It is truly matte, so make sure you like a matte lip product before buying!",2
3,I like this razor like I like any other razors I have used. The only difference is this one has a trimmer on the other end. My hair grows back very fast so my legs stay smooth for maybe a day. But having the trimmer on the other end that I can use in the shower is super convenient especially when your in a hurry. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.,2
3,"Although these are great flossers...they specifically state \\""long lasting mint\\""...and they don't have any minty taste AT ALL--so that was pretty disappointing. That was a big reason I choose this specific flosser over others that are offered--I def. think they are misleading...you think you're getting flosser that will have lots of minty-freshness....and there's no flavor at all. Don't think I'd buy these again.",2
3,I thought it will have different sizes! The size is pefect for medium and large brushes..<br />Small brushes (eyeliner/eyebrow/...) it doesn't hold them perfectly!,2
3.0,Ok so maybe it is keeping my color lasting longer but it does nothing else for my hair.  Going back to old product.,2
3,"A bit small for my wife, she said it is all cotton so she was able to stretch it enough to fit without sliding up or creating headaches.",2
3.0,"The product didn't straighten as well as the CHI straightener I have had, in my opinion, but I guess for half the price I should have expected it. After reading the reviews I was really excited for this straightener, but it disappointed me to be honest. The oil worked well...similar to Moroccan oil that I currently use. The temperature knob is very loose, makes the product seem somewhat cheap-- but maybe mine is just broken?",2
3,Does not stay inn hair very well because the claw is not strong enough. Make butterfly claw clips with claws that are not so rounded and are stronger.,2
3,"I've used a ton of oils and treatments like this, and this isn't one of my favorites.  I love Enjoy luxury shampoo and conditioner, but the shine and smooth made my hair a little sticky and heavy.  Although it felt better once I dried it with the hair dryer, I find that the smoother oils work better and require less drying time.  It did make my hair shiny, in a non-oily way, though.  This is better than using nothing, but not as good as, say the L'Oreal Mythic Oil.",2
3.0,"For the price, reviews, and the fact that I've owned my current straightener for 10 years now... I decided to try this one out. Compared to my Paul Mitchell straightener, which is 4x as much, this one is almost as nice. My only complaint is I find I have to go over the same section of hair 2-3 times to get the same smooth results as my other flat iron. If you're looking for an affordable flat iron or an extra one for travel... This one is probably your best option! However, the less time I can spend on my hair, the better... So if in another 10 years I'll need another flat iron, I'll be purchasing a Paul Mitchell.",2
3,"When I apply this serum to my face it looks a little shinny, but it is not greasy. The smell is good.  So far not impressed with the product for my type of skin, others may get different results.  Haven't seem any changes to my face, and I purchased other Dead Sea products, but haven't see the change yet. I will update my review if I see any good changes.",2
3,"The whole reason I ordered this stamper/Scraper is because I wanted the scraper to be plastic, but when I received it the scraper had a metal end. I don't like that the metal scratches the plates when used. The stamper is good however and just what I expected.",2
3,"The fragrance is very light just as I like it, but it doesn't last very long",2
3,"This sponge is ideal for people with sensitive skin who don't want the abrasive scratch of a synthetic body puff. The natural sea wool is luxuriously soft and non-irritating. However, the sponge is too small- it easily slips out of my hand and there is no string to hang it from for storage or to wrap around my fingers when showering. Also, I've noticed that I need to use more body wash than with a synthetic sponge because the suds fall off the sponge quite easily. After a few months, I threw the sponge away because it was starting to collect dirt that would not rinse out. Great idea, but implementation could be better.",2
3,"Product has a strange and slightly off-putting smell. This may be because I am used to over-perfumed Western products, so take that with a grain of salt, but the bigger issue I had was that it instantly stripped my face, leaving it feeling dry and tight. Dry skin folks may need to avoid.",2
3,I may be mistaken but it seems that this product is not as good as it used to be.  In the past I could apply it once in the morning and it really lasted all day-- not any more.  I could be mistaken but it seems that it is not as good now.  At least it is not working as well for me.,2
3,it scratched my face,2
3,"They are pretty, but it's a random mix and the adhesive that comes with them is crap.",2
3,"I bought this for my daughters hair big mistake! It works ok yes you will get some shine but its not worth breathing half of it in while your spraying!! People who have used it know exactly what I mean Im so surprised so many people gave it 5 stars. My daughter hates it she has to cover her face the whole time and a couple minutes after. It goes everywhere I don't like that! Best way I can explain it is like a mist that goes all through the air in your eyes,face,mouth.Would never purchase again even if it did work as good as people say.",2
3,"The wood quality is good, however the width is very short and doesn't go well through my long hair.  Next time I'll look for one with longer width.",2
3,Love the smell decent color... But to expensive for what it is.  It doesn't seem to last on my skin.,2
3,I love these things but I expected this to be small and it was not. Maybe this is the smallest size they make? I'm not sure but the person I bought it for has thin hair and this was too big for them.,2
3,One it's Katy Perry and two I got my girlfriend the last years perfume and she loved it so I decided to follow up by getting this one and she likes Katy Perry,2
3.0,Ho hum but better than a washcloth.,2
3,"So far they seem as good as the standard heads. I don't think they replace proper flossing, but the price is similar to the standard heads, so I would probably choose them again",2
3,"I wanted something that would last so I didn't want an aftershave. I paid more for this &#34;cologne&#34; because of it, yet it doesn't last long at all. The first few days I could smell it on myself for 4-6 hours, then 2 hours at most, then 30 minutes tops. At first I thought I got used to the smell real fast, but if I can't smell it no one can smell it on me, even inches away!<br />This is upsetting because I really like the Old Spice smell, but I also don't want to have to reapply it every 20-30 minutes.",2
3,"It's hard to find a tanning lotion that smells great before and after tanning, this one does! I was surprised at how tan it made me skin, too. However, this is a THICK lotion. I kind of feel gross after tanning due to the thickness. I probably wouldn't buy again.",2
3,"These lashes are so / so. The reason I give it a 3 is because many of the lashes are obnoxious. There are probably 2 types in the entire set I would wear. On the plus side, they weren't that expensive.",2
3,They do the job but were not like the picks I got from my previous dentist. I guess after I use them awhile and get used to them I'll probably like these better. 😄,2
3,"Recently my mouth and throat dried out when I slept at night but not when I was awake during the day. At night I awoke hourly to take a drink of water to relieve the pain in my mouth and throat. This is no way to get a good night's sleep so I was tired all the time.<br /><br />I have tried numerous products, separately and together, which were on the Internet and/or were recommended by my dentist, ENR and other medical professionals to provide \\""Hours of relief from dry mouth\\"", to quote one of product blurbs. These products included mouthwashes, gums, lozenges, sprays, toothpastes, and gels; about a dozen in all.<br /><br />The only one that really provided hours of relief from dry mouth was Biotene Oral Balance Gel. After using it I sleep for about three hours before I awake with a dry mouth but not a dry, painful throat. The second application, which I apply without rinsing my mouth, allows me to sleep through the rest of the night.<br /><br />Biotene Oral Balance Gel is not perfect but it's the best of a bad lot. It is expensive and has an awful taste, a horrible mouth-feel, and leaves a bad taste in the mouth which lasts much of the day. Were it not for these defects I would have rated this product 5-star because it was the only one whose use allowed me to get a good night's sleep.",2
3,I love this product but I just wish I got a bigger barrel because this makes tighter curls so short hair curls up very short!!,2
3,"just okay.  With all the rave reviews I thought this scent would be terrific.<br />To me, it is not. I smell more Clary sage and nothing else.  As of today , I will alway try the scents of essential oils in person.<br />This Essential Oil will be regifted to someone else  who loves the smell.  The service was very fast with Eden gardens and item was well wrapped.",2
3,"NYX is usually a good value and this palette didn't disappoint. It contains pretty greens, a rusty orange and nice brown. The colors are soft, blendable and rich. They do have a little sparkle. The palette comes with a big mirror.  On the inside of cover and a little applicator brush.  I recommend a good base like Shadow insurance or Urban decay.",2
3,"Not the one I thought it was. This one is okay but real perfumy, which I don't like. I like soft floral scents. This just smells really strong. Not unbearable perhaps, but not soft and light.",2
3,Use in shower or its makes a mess - nice product - smooths out dry skin.,2
3,I went back to an old cleaner. This one has a lot of cheap plastic,2
3,"I have used the Sonic Care toothbrush for several years. Today I got the Oral B Pulsonic for Christmas. I like the slim design, and it seems to clean the teeth well. The problem is that the toothbrush head fell off twice during use. Maybe it is vibrating off? Also it feels a little cheapy compared to Sonic care, and the vibration is a little more rough. If you are trying to decide between the two types. Get the Sonic Care. It is seems to be made better and is higher quality.",2
3,"The quality of this shadow is similar to the cheap 88 palettes made in China. Bright, but talc-y and soft and not particularly pigmented. Appropriate for the price but not a great deal.<br /><br />The seller put three Sleek palettes into a media mailer with NO bubble wrap or padding, and one of the colors was shattered. I fixed it with some 91% alcohol, a paper towel and a penny and re-pressed it.",2
3,"Fendi is no longer produced,yet you claimed to have it for sale??  I did not receive Fendi, but was sent Jean Marc Sinan perfume in a Fendi bottle??",2
3,Way too small.  It was a sample item that shouldn't have even been on sale.  Be careful with the size.,2
3,"I ordered this product and Resilience and I much prefer Resilience for my skin which is older,bday to medium.  Seems and feels creamier, more tightening and a wonderful smell.  Time Zone isn't bad but not as good as Resilience for me....",2
3,We have tried to use this tint kit for eyelashes once and were not completely impressed with the outcome. Maybe we will keep trying and hopefully with practice we will finally get a better result.,2
3,"It works well, for a skin lightening product, would recommend, but had to mix it with another product to prevent it from breaking out my face.",2
3,These are OK. I have had nicer touch up sticks though.,2
3,"Smells great however extremely difficult to apply. I hate getting the deodorant in my fingernails.  A stick comes with the deodorant to dig into the hard consistency.  You then have to pick up the little pieces that have crumbled.  With your fingers, you have to somehow get the crumbles of deodorant into your armpit and rub it in using your fingers without any falling onto the floor or countertop.  I have found, do not dry yourself thoroughly, as it is much easier to rub into your armpit with some moisture.  Great idea...need to work on the application.",2
3,can very small,2
3,"I had guests sleeping over that found out during their stay that the lice they treated were not in fact gone. I was pregnant at the time and didn't have alot of realistic options as to address the probable infestation in the house. That's why I chose LiceLogic.   It smells nice, and didn't stain any fabrics/upholstry. The bottle has a large enough volume that I was able to spray 3 rooms, twice, and still have more than half a bottle left.   Did it \\""DESTROY LICE ON ANY SURFACE\\""? I don't know. Maybe none of the lice on my neices heads were mature enough to migrate far enough to create a problem in my house?",2
3.0,"First of all, this is a very well made item.  I like that it's made of wood, and it's durable enough to travel etc.  That's why I bought it.  My complaint would be it's about twice as big as I was expecting.  I thought beard and mustache combs were smaller than hair combs.  Not this one, it might be bigger.  It's probably great for guys who enter beard competitions, but it doesn't work well for shorter beards.",2
3,It's great but very blotchy. I would recommend someone spray this on for you rather than yourself.,2
3,"I have many scars on my face due to pimples, i wanted to use this before the derma roller. I literally had to put my face in the cylinder to have steam evenly on my face",2
3,You can buy a similar sized microfiber towel in the home goods department of most discounts for 1/4 to 1/3 the price of this one. There is nothing uniquely Deva about it. The point is the good absorption so you can squeeze your hair dry and not rub it dry. Any microfiber kitchen towel will work the same.,2
3.0,The can didn't always spray well or evenly but when it did it worked well.,2
3,No grand results like I hoped. Tried acne zinc instead. The price difference was remarkable and so was the outcome of acne clear up.,2
3,"For the price, this stuff is good and does it's job. It's a little too light weight and sheer/translucent for my liking, I find myself applying a bit more than I think I should to get the results I like. I also have pretty oily skin. This BB cream tends to leave my skin dewy/sticky. I will probably look for something else a little more matte once I'm done with this tube.",2
3,"maybe it's just me...<br />I usually rake my face with a Mach 3 and some lye soap... my doctor recommended I try going back to electric shaver, so I got these to replace the heads and blades that have been sitting for years. While it shaved my stubbled facial hair with ease and fairly quickly, it also made my face look as if I'd run it through a wood chipper! Okay, maybe not THAT bad, but I had red streaks, razor burn, and general itchiness. I cleaned the blades and heads, tried again... kept trying for about a week... it's back in the back of the cabinet where it will likely stay forever.",2
3.0,dries somewhat orange tint..fakey looking..,2
3,I was very excited when I found out that Amazon had the Naked Palette available BUT it took forever for me to get this product that I was so looking forward to getting.<br /><br />***Good if you're willing to wait...Bad if you're like me and want things asap...especially beauty/makeup products***,2
3.0,"If you are looking for an alternative to mainstream toothpaste this may not be it as it contains Sodium Laurel Sulphate which you may or may not want to avoid.  Also contains carrageenan, sodium silicate and sodium saccharin.<br />If you are looking for a homeopathic toothpaste this is not it as it contains spearmint oil.",2
3,I also purchased versace Bright chystal. which is my signature fragrance. and i love it the noir is nice just a little heavier.more for night use.,2
3,"It is just OK, i thought it would glide on better. When I opened it today, there was no tip...it had fallen off in the lid. I was able to retrieve it and put it back in the barrel, but i am not happy that it came apart, especially for the price. disappointed.",2
3,No noticeable  difference after using the cream for over one week. Some relief after two. Wouldn't buy again. Stick to hot compress or heating pad.,2
3,"I would have given this product, more than 3 stars, if they had included a pair of safety glasses or some kind of eye-wear because the laser light is literally blinding so you kinda lose track of where you started and how much gap to give. So I ended up going over some places more than once. Safety glasses are a must at all the laser hair removal clinics, I have gone to. Otherwise, this product worked quite well. It was virtually painless where I had shaved but stung a bit on the areas that had a bit of stubble.<br />Now waiting to see the results. :)",2
3,"I purchased this for my daughter for diy purposes. When I received this and opened it to take a whiff, I almost fell down. Woo! This stuff has an extremely strong smell, however it probably will work for whatever your purposes are.",2
3.0,"I bought this to cover some scars.  I applied it and ended up having to use a darker foundation on top of it, which was an added expense.<br />I thought it would work , being that I have very fair skin and don't tan.  It might work for you, just know it is a very light cover up.",2
3,"I have no idea why this product was not delivered with the manufacturer's packaging, which is attractive.  This was a Mother's Day gift for my wife and I was disappointed to get a poorly packaged item, and which omitted the manufacturer's box.  The price was not competitive to previous purchases of the same product through other sources.  You would have thought that the so-called &#34;hassle free&#34; no box arrangement may have at least provided the benefit of a more competitive price.<br /><br />Unfortunately for me, I hastily placed the order before carefully reviewing the description.  In any event, make sure to check everything carefully or run the risk of getting disappointed.<br /><br />On a side note, I can not stress enough how important attention to packaging is for Amazon customers!  It says a lot about the provider of the 'service,' be it fulfilled by Amazon or one of its third-party providers.  If you are unable to be a professional, then please do not try to sell anything.  You are just pissing loyal customers off when you do that!  The only saving grace is the fact that the product itself is a good product...",2
3,Was impressed to see the number of reviews. However feels like it is not that great or better than other electric rollers!,2
3,"Eh it's alright, but id rather use brow liner :) it just wasnt the same taupe color as my NYC brow liner i use.",2
3,I tried this salt scrubs on my hands  and this feels more like salt rub and not enough coconut oil in this mixture I was extremely disappointment to me after trying one rub in Fort Myers Florida  which I love the feel of it at the restaurant we were eating while on vacationing in Florida . Did not buy at restaurant since they were out them.So when I saw this Florida Salt Scrubs at you web site I figure this was going to be the same rub I use but no it was not the same rub:(,2
3,Not really impressed  by this product! I expected it to make my skin feel firmer but that didn't work I am going back to my old face revitalizer,2
3,"It leaves my hair a bit greasy and nappy, but I've only used it once so far so perhaps I need to get used to it. I noticed that a lot of the more natural shampoos/conditioners do this so still trying to find one that works perfectly.",2
3,rarely use it but it's fun for costumes,2
3,"Please be very careful!!  As a physician who does chemical peels with TCA, this stuff must be used by someone familiar with it and with different skin types and colors. You  could cause permanent damage or scarring.  You should also know how to prevent post-treatment hyperpigmentation and how to treat chemical burns.  For some people, even a 10% solution can be very strong.  If you are going to do a TCA peel, it is better to start with a low strength and do a series of treatments than to do one treatment at high strength.",2
3.0,It worked for about 6 months. Now it keeps displaying error. Not too happy considering the investment financially on a flat iron,2
3,not much change after application,2
3,Ordered the wrong thing,2
3,They would be fine if the clips were designed better. It does not hold the roller in place at all.,2
3.0,Wonderful,2
3,"I expected my hair to have more volume after using this shampoo but didn't see or feel much of a difference.  It also has an odd smell that's hard to describe- probably from the almond milk.  To really work up a lather your hair has to be very wet, it took me a few times to figure that out.  My hair seems healthier after using it so that's a good thing.  However, I will probably try something else before buying this again.",2
3,"This is a typical Sonicare tooth brush, it's built and functions well, and will for years to come.<br />This model has the 2 minute timer, but does NOT have the 30 sec &#34;bump&#34; timer that tells you how far through the cycle it is. I'm dissapointed that Sonicare removed this feature from their base model.",2
3,The mirror portion has nothing to stabilize it.  Will flip around if you don't move very slowly.  All in all very flimsy and doubt that it will last long before it breaks.  Hard to get at an angle that is useful for the intended purpose.,2
3.0,Good product.  Shipping too expensive.,2
3,"I have had the top pf the line Oral B for several years and while this one is ok, you can tell the difference in the quality.",2
3,It's okay.  It will do for now until I can get the real thing that lasts quite a while--Botox.  But this is okay.,2
3,"The product looks original but I am not sure of the fit! it seems to fit extra small, not the same as the ones purchased from local dealer and doctors office. Maybe it is a knock-off? If it lasts, maybe next time i will have to order a medium.",2
3,Favorite perfume of all time.,2
3,"likes this really well, however, it is really hard to clean out of plates to renew. This is the second time he has used this.",2
3,the glitter does not show up as much as I would like,2
3,"works as intended, not as well built as the real ones, bristtles coming off after a few uses, but for the price, its a good buy",2
3,Just started using this product after swimming and it seems to be doing the trick of cooling my skin after swimming in our sun drenched pool.,2
3,I did not find this product as great as other people were saying as of I have only used it a few times,2
3,It broke after a 2 weeks.,2
3,"After trying epilation for a few times using this device I have decided that I hate epilation.  It's too painful, and leaves my skin red and raw.  The skin looks soft, but you can still feel the hair.  I'm not sure how this Braun Epilator compares to others, but it's built with high quality, and has a solid feel in my hands.  I will not be using it again though, since I found it so enjoyable.  If you know you will use an Epilator, then this one seems like an excellent product.  However, since I'm not an expert, and probably won't try epilation again, I'm not confident.  The three stars is simply because I found this product un-usable by me.  Too painful, and not worth it.  I'll stick with my razor.",2
3,LIKE THIS VERY MUCH,2
3,"Brightened the skin on my legs but left them feeling dry. That could be the sunscreen element. The very best body moisturizer I ever found was the Vaseline w/alpha hydroxy, but they discontinued it (twice).",2
3,Very light for my pale complexion. Wish i could have tried before i bought it. Seems to be a good quality and has a nice smell.,2
3,"Pros: Smells great and isn't too sticky<br />Cons: I didn't really notice any difference in my split ends<br /><br />Overall: It's a relatively affordable hair product. I have thick (very thick) hair, and so I probably used a bit more at a time than what most other people would need. For its stated purpose of mending split ends, I can't say that I've gotten any good results (at least not noticeably so). However, I let a friend use it once who has very fine hair and she stated that using this hair serum after a shower was perfect for increasing her styling ease. Maybe this product is better for someone with thinner hair then?",2
3,"We had expected more from this product after reading earlier reviews and recommendations.  Use of floss is still necessary and still learning better techniques for use, to prevent tearing of soft tissue.",2
3,These are great very easy to match to hust about everything and they have held up great while washing i would buy this again,2
3,"its Ok, Its not fun to use, I am not sure as its my first electric brush but its just sitting there and not using any more.",2
3,"I am not sure if they got a new brush or what but my recent order of cover girl mascara is messy! Just a little extra flip of the hand and specks of mascara go flying around my eyes. I love the product, but I do not like the clean up.",2
3,"This product seemed a bit runny, watery, compared to previous purchases. Still did the job.",2
3,"I wore these for my wedding, and they were beautiful.  They were large enough to be visible under my veil without being huge.  I loved that they weren't the same bubbly-looking cutesy flowers like you see everyone else selling.  Absolutely perfect.  Plus, they stayed well in my hair all night, despite the crazy dancing that went on.<br /><br />The size listed on this item right now is 2.5\\"", but that's ridiculous and completely wrong.  I don't have them in front of me right now, but I'd say they're maybe 3/4\\"" diameter.<br /><br />My only problem with them was the fact that I saw these on amazon, which listed them as available, and later was informed by the company that they were actually out of stock and my order had been cancelled/refunded.  I spoke with the company trying to figure out who their distributor was so that I could order them myself, or so that I could at least figure out when/if this company would get them back in stock, and they were no help.  I simply got a \\""we don't know when.  Could be several months.\\""  Luckily, they ended up being back in stock eventually, not that anyone thought to inform me when they were.<br /><br />If you think you might want these, just be sure to order FAR in advance in case they're out of stock then and you have to wait a few months for them to come back in, and don't necessarily believe the \\""Only # left in stock!  Order soon!\\"" because they can't seem to track that properly.",2
3,"When I bought this I knew that there were two potential scents for this product (lemon/cucumber or cinnamon/sandalwood.)  Looking back I wish I had bought directly from Lockhart to ensure which I got.  Although between the purchase and writing this review, give or take 6 days, it seems they have changed how they let you select the fragrance on their site (the description for goon grease states that you can choose the scent, but the option to do so has dissappeared.)  If you are looking for the citrus scent, I assume that's what their Lemon goon grease is for now, so I would recommend getting that if that scent sounds more appealing to you.<br /><br />To be fair though, I don't mind the cinnamon scent, it's one of the better spice scents I've used in products like these.  I would compare it to the scent of Anchor's Teddy Boy original pomade mixed with murrays.<br /><br />As far as how well the product works, my first impressions thus far are underwhelming.  I have very thick and wavy hair, with an undercut and about 3-4 inches on top.  I usually style in a sort of comb-over/pomp in a way that let's the wave in my hair seem natural.  So far, Goon grease doesn't seem much different in application to murray's superior, besides the slightly easier scooping from the can and the spreading in the hands.  When I apply it and start styling, I don't really feel like I have the control that I want from a petro product.  My pomps so far have seemed pretty short and I REALLY don't appreciate how many fly aways I am having, even with a generous application.  On top of that, it has not lasted throughout the day like I had expected it too, with my bangs falling over my forehead just after getting home from work (a desk job where I don't spend a lot of time sweating or moving.)  I'm used to having an oil-based product do that only after I lift weights in the evenings.<br /><br />I will say that I like the level of shine in this product and that makes my wavy hair look great in a side-part comb-over.<br /><br />For reference I have used murray's superior, dax w&g, and o'douds heavy hold.  If you are looking for a less greasy high-hold oil-based pomade I personally recommend the o'douds over this for hair like mine (although the scent on that product isn't as pleasant.)  And so far, both goon grease and o'douds are expensive compared to the value of murray's and dax.  This is the main reason I'm giving this a 3/5 for initial impressions.<br /><br />I'll look to make an update for this review after I've used this product more.",2
3,"Pretty, glass bottle, but the white nozzle tops are not leak proof. They seem to fit tightly, yet when I gently shake them to mix my essential oils, they leak. My tops have two notches in the top. I contacted the seller, and they responded that these are the only tops available. I am going to keep them, but they are not for travel.",2
3,"This is a great lotion with SPF, but I've found that it doesn't do enough to moisturize my dry skin. This is probably great for those with oily to combination skin, but if you're skin is drier, you'll probably need something else.",2
3,"I never really got the point of styling cream but this is the only one I have tried that I like. It smells nice and I use a small pump after a shower. Gives my hair texture while controlling some of my frizz. I have naturally dry hair, and it's normally easy for me to get texture so I don't feel the need for this, but it's nice to use sometimes.",2
3,"I like to use this device to shave and trim my mustache. Because of its size it can be difficult to get the right angle. But with practice I have been able to successfully use this shaver to trim my sideburns, trim my mustache and goatee.",2
3,"The reason I purchased the argan oil is because one of the reviews said not only does it work well but it smells good, well, it doesn't but my hair appears to be soft ---- unsure if it's working or changing the texture of my hair, feels the same --- I'm not impressed..",2
3,Delivery was prompt and product was well protected. The product was what I expected. Price was unbelievable deal. Well worth buying online. Glad I searched within Amazon from sellers varied prices. I chose the better deal for the same product. Recommend this seller. BUT! the holder does'nt hold the OPI and bigger bottles as well. It drops lower and lower as you use it.,2
3,"The gloves tore the first time I put them on, when they're supposed to be reusable. As for the color, it turned out purple on my red hair. Looks nice but not as bright as I'd hoped, and it took multiple applications for each streak to get complete coverage. But for the price, and if you are just experimenting and don't want a permanent color, this is fine.",2
3,It was okay but i like the peach scent better and it last longer to me than any other lotion.,2
3,"Clear Pores is I'm sure an excellent product, but doesn't work overnight. My daughter has been using it for about a month but hasn't been able to get rid of her acne yet... I can wait until her face is all clear!",2
3,A cool folding comb and the comb part is nice. However the clip broke off within a few weeks of use (keeping it in my pocket). The clip is not very strong.,2
3.0,"Pros:  It has a very nice pretty curl pattern.  Also, it is low luster (not shiny at all), so it does not look wiggy.<br />Cons:  It is frizz-prone.  On the first day that I wore it, it looked a little frizzy.",2
3,"Not that Great,in my opinion.This brand of razors is just okay.It did something,but not what i wanted it to do.I get that it's for sensitive use,but way too sensitive.It did not do do much of anything,therefore i was unsatisfied with the results.I will have to try another brand.I can't recommend,because this is not a product i would buy again.",2
3,"hello,<br /><br />I have used several tingles, this one is not very hot to me. At one time is was very hot. It does not seem to have the tingle it use to.<br /><br />Have a nice day,<br /><br />Shelby Parris",2
3,"This is a an okay product. I used it with the KeraCare blowdry dry lotion and it didn't dry out my hair, but my hair feel really silky either.",2
3,I used this to remove patchy hair growth on my face.  Best used in conjunction with a hair removal cream to reduce possibility of ingrown hairs.<br /><br />I've been using this product for a few months now and it helped thin out hair in about 30% of the area applied to but is still struggling with the thicker areas of hair growth.  I have definitely seen some improvement but not the complete hair removal I was looking for.  It's definitely worth a spin if your hair is thin to begin with.  Remember to give it at least a month to see results.<br /><br />I'll continue to use until the bottle runs out and see where I end up.,2
3,"This did not do anything. The only saving grace was the sponge as a sponge, but it never lived up to it's hype.",2
3,"I wanted to love this, but I think its just ok. It doesn't fit larger lipsticks, only medium sized ones, and is difficult to organize. Also, it is much smaller in real life than you would picture. If you are looking for something that isn't spectacular but is just so-so, then this might work for you. But it isn't that wonderful, so you might want to just keep looking.",2
3,"We're on our 3rd one.  Does an awesome job, but only for a certain amount of time...then although the motor works strongly, the mechanism that changes circular motion to back and forth motion seems to quit.  Several handi guys have taken them apart but never get them working again.  BUT we get WAY MORE than 10 bucks of value out of them before they die.  When this one goes, will reorder again!!!",2
3,I'm not sure if this is working but then I haven't been using it every day.,2
3,Used it for the first time today. Love the way smells and the way it cleanses. I also love the way it makes my hair feel.,2
3,"The only reason I give this 3 stars is that it's SOOO HEAVY. I think if it came in multiple pieces it would be a bit easier to spread around the head and offset some of the weight. Other than that: great color, easy to brush, easy to use. The people that complain about the smell have never worked with artificial hair. This is what it always smells like coming out of the box, the smell goes away in all of 10 minutes.",2
3,"I wanted to like it, but it didn't work for me personally. I have thin, fine hair, and a lot of it. It clumps together really easily and even wet was kind of hard to work in and make it look good. The hold is great, and for $10 it's worth a shot for most I'm sure.",2
3,Has not lived up to its promises of keeping my skin from freezing. It's a nice consistency but has not fulfilled it's purposes for which I bought  it  for.,2
3,"This newer version of an older product is so light that it hardly provides enough weight to notice the effects of the product.  I should have paid better attention to the 2 oz. jar size, large enough for a couple of applications at most.  Strengths:  Pleasant light scent, non-sticky & not greasy.",2
3,"Well, the pattern is actually reversed, so I have to use the scissors handle backwards ( the wrong way) to get the scalloped edge or else the pattern goes inward. Hard to explain in an email. I think it's an error from the manufacturer,Also the pattern is much smaller than I expected..",2
3,"The pins are thinner, not as sturdy. They twist when applying. Still useful, if needed. Very disappointed. I always look for the Goody brand.",2
3,"It does the job, but it doesn't compare to the original that the machine came with. The opening system for cleaning is not great either, prone to breakage.",2
3.0,Its works Ok.,2
3,"I read the reviews and thought &#34;how bad can the case be?&#34;  Answer:  &#34;Pretty frick'n bad&#34;.  The items are great, really good quality; the case, which is one of the main reason you get a travel kit, is very poor at best.  I don't want to say it is a useless case, but it's not good either.  This would be 4 to 5 stars if it had a decent case you could trust to hold everything.",2
3,I have been using NuVectin for about three weeks and positive results are starting to show.  My skin is not dry any more and two friends have asked me if I have done something for it looks much better!,2
3,"And her skin looks great. I don't know if Sirius Light System can take all the credit because she eats really well and takes care of her health (organic, veggies, fruits, nuts, low meat consumption and plenty of water and exercise).Theresa",2
3,fair.,2
3.0,"Not sure if I'm doing it wrong but it's just okay. Nothing great, but it gets the job done",2
3,"I have this about a month.  It went on smooth BUT bubbles up when dry.  I did the coats lighter the next time, it was better but still a bit bubbly but OK.",2
3,"Decrease the price and I will think of buying it again.<br /><br />The \\""pulse\\"" feature is really unnecessary but the idea was good.  The mascara itself was fine, but shipping was WAY too expensive.",2
3,"This is my 2nd order of this product. The 1st one worked better. It removed a rather large mole on my chin. I tried this newer product on some skin tags and a mole, neither of which were removed. The cream does help keep my skin from stinging so much after the product is removed. I'll keep applying and hopefully it will work.",2
3,"Im on the third day after using the TCA 30% peel. My skin right now has a very ugly dark scab, is super tight to the touch and feel. Im hoping that this scab will begin to peel soon then i'll see the new skin underneath. I used this skin on a small patch of acne scars on my cheek. I'll update my review in a week.",2
3,"I like the hydration, and can appreciate the SPF 15 in this product, but it makes this cream feel heavy like a sunscreen and less like a quick facial hydrator. This is just my preference, this may work for you if you don't mind the heavy feel to it.",2
3,The scent does not last very long and is not strong. Hardly lasts the duration of a tea light. could be better. weak scent,2
3,Not any better than better body washes.  It would have been better had it had less chemicals and more classified as 'organic'.  I will not purchase again.,2
3,Love! I have used almost daily since buying,2
3,"It's nice looking, but the top is black instead of gold as depicted.  I repainted the top gold.  Now it works for me as it was intended only as a decortive piece.",2
3,It look like the picture.,2
3,ok,2
3,You really get your monies worth but it takes forever to unscrew this product i will not reorder. cannot say if work.<br />because i havnt use it consistently.,2
3,"Very cute, colors are nice and bright - works temporarily.  Wouldn't recommend for any prolonged walking as the prongs break off pretty easily.",2
3,"I use this product all the time and love it. However, this tune that I received is a totally different consistency than the usual product is. Usually, it is almost a gel like product. However, this tune has a lotion type consistency in it. My tan has not stayed on as well either with its use. I'm not sure if the manufacturer changed their production or what exactly.",2
3,"Don't be fooled by the bottle, as I was, this is clear polish with silver glitter in it.  It's nice polish I was just expecting pink polish with glitter.",2
3,Disappointed.  When I pay for an item it should be prefect as this was a gift!  I was embarrassed to give as a gift but she didn't mind.,2
3,I love the smell of honey suckle. This has a great smell at first but it doesn't last very long.,2
3.0,not too bad. great for if you are in a hurry for one. there are better ones out there. recommond the ASP brand one at sally beauty supply.,2
3,I am not beautiful and 'years younger' but my skin is soft.,2
3,"This is a fine cleanser, gentle and non-irritating. I don't know if the ingredients justify the price though. After all how much benefit can your skin get from what might be very good stuff if it's only on your face for a short amount of time? How \\""nutritive\\"" can it really be? It says it does help with redness and blotchy patches and this is true. But for my money I prefer Murad's anti-redness cleanser. It takes off makeup beautifully, you get more for your money and a little bit goes a long way. I also don't like that the Perricone cleanser warns to avoid contact with eyes.",2
3,"My eyelashes do not look like the ladies on tv, maybe because they have on fake lashes but it works like regular mascara nothing extra.",2
3,"I ordered this as part of a Cosplay costume for Florida Supercon.<br /><br />The color was good, but the can is tiny...<br /><br />There was enough in it for one application to completely color all of my hair. If I had needed it for more than one day of the convention I would not have had enough.",2
3,"I got this product free from participating with BzzAgent.  Not a big fan of the 'system'.  I didn't notice any difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  Not a big fan of peppermint, would prefer a spearmint version.  The one big issue I have is that tube 1 has a flip top (great!), but the 2nd tube is a twist cap.  Doesn't seem to be a problem at first thought, until you are in the middle of brushing.  So you finish the first step, and your toothbrush (and maybe your had) is wet, and now you need to hands to hold the 2nd tube and twist the top off.  But I don't want to set my wet brush down anywhere, so either you try to twist with one hand, or keep the brush in your mouth, or put it in a cup or something.  Would have been much easier to put the flip cap on the 2nd tube as well, which is much easier to do with one hand.",2
3.0,"For some reason the sample was finish and the 3.0ml was used also. am disappointed but not sure who is responsible so i dont wish to make claim, also it would take too long. am just lucky it was for a relatie that they not all up my case about the mis-hap. everything else was timely and okay.",2
3,Just recently found out I have a lot of contact allergies. I can only wear 2 sunscreens and this one. I received the product quickly and found it to be good.,2
3,"It works alright.. not my favorite Fekkai shampoo, doesn't really lather up well but I just wanted to text it out. I prefer the moisturizing one or the protein rx reparative!",2
3,"I enjoy the scent, but was disappointed in the size.  Was expecting about the size of a lipstick, but thinner.  Thank you for the quick delivery.  Nancy",2
3,terrible product....,2
3,"smells better than the Vitalis I bought 40 years ago, but does not not seem to flatten hair as well.",2
3,Could not tell a difference between this and my regular product.,2
3,I use this for just about everything xD i use different shades for my face and for concealing my eyebrows. i also fill in my eyebrows with this. it's good. i'd recommend it if you're not a person who obsesses over extremely good quality makeup and higher end brands.,2
3,Love it but it feels very cheap,2
3,"After the first use, I feel like this should be better for the cost. I followed the owner's instruction video. The curl pattern was okay... I didn't have any white residue, but left my hair feeling stiff and crunchy. Then, if I Spritz WIth water it would soften up. But only while wet. Made me look like a have a Jerri curl. :-( . Maybe Just not for me. I may finish the jar or give it away.",2
3,Thought it would be extra pigmented...same as any other eye shadow .,2
3,"its ridiculously small, not much else to say but that they r like the size of the period on a key board",2
3,so far its ok i haven't seen any major changes in my skin have only use it for a short time will let you know after 30 days of use,2
3,I like the large clipper and the small clipper. the gripe I have is that<br />1) the small clipper uses replaceable aa batteries and<br />2) small clipper is not rechargeable. Also the listing did not state that the small clipper comes without any guards for different types of trimming.<br /><br />the listing needs to be more forthcoming. Jim,2
3,was much work to prepare but was fine. I chose to learn to do henna. and I learned that it is difficult to make.,2
3,"I thought the cool thing about this trimmer was the vacuum part... I always make a mess when in the bathroom trimming.  Well, the vacuum part worked for about 2 weeks.  Now it still make the vacuuming sound, but it doesn't suck up half of the hair being trimmed.  The unit also is fully metal=looking plastic, so it probably will break sooner than later.",2
3,Switch is shorting out and light isn't that bright,2
3.0,"I gave 3 stars because I just started using the product, so to claim anything one way or another would be premature. What I can say so far is this product goes on easy and leaves my skin feeling wonderful and light. I feel like it gives me a natural glow (not shiny) and it's made of all natural ingredients, so I love that. I would suggest this product to my friends.",2
3,"I added this product to my skincare regimen hoping that I had finally found a good moisturizer for sensitive skin. After several weeks using the product every morning along with the Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Cleansing Pads, I have seen no improvement in my skin's clarity. I have always had a problem with little breakouts here and there, but never with the large under-the-surface pimples that started appearing on my face. Ouch! After I stopped using the lotion my skin started clearing up again. The lotion itself is a great moisturizer and is not heavy at all. The fragrance was also very light and pleasant. I would certainly have continued using the product if it weren't for the fact that it just didn't agree with my skin. I will continue to use Aveeno's cleansing pads as they work wonderfully, but I will be looking for another moisturizer.",2
3,A little harsh on the head but does the job for the price and shipped quickly. The bristles are hard but long enough to reach the scalp for people with thick hair.,2
3.0,Dont dislike but can be streaky unless you REALLY rub! I am somewhat pale but havent had to work as hard with other products. Does smell good and moisturize though. Probably meant for little darker people or it looks orangeish,2
3,"The product good. Price its OK. But you can find it cheaper at COSTCO, plus an additional product. My wife is happy and that's w3hat it counts. Thanks.",2
3,"The product is alright, the only problem is that the foundation brush sheds a lot. The rest of the brushes are fine and it arrived fast.",2
3,"I used to use this perfume all the time and when they pulled it of the shelves at Victoria Secret I went on here to look for some. I ordered this because it is a good deal for how much your getting and how long it will last you BUT I got the package and it had no other protection then some paper wrapped around it therefore the seal around the sprayer was broken and it was leaking. I was very disappointed with the packaging, Make sure you specify that you want it in a box.",2
3.0,I have been using the product for a couple of weeks now and I can't tell yet if any improvement but there may be some small reduction of darkness under the eyes. I'll keep at it and hopefully the improvement will become more visible.,2
3,"I didn't hate it and didn't love it, I wanted it but didn't trust the Limecrime site(and I was right to) ended up giving it to a friend as the color needed to be applied frequently and it dried out my lips to the point of discomfort.",2
3,"Gave me smooth skin, but that was the only thing I noticed after 3 weeks of using the product.  If you do purchase this product make sure to follow directions and apply on dry skin.",2
3,"Use is intuitive, I like that. I'm not a hair-do person, and don't like investing much time creating a look. This device gives me a more finished appearance.<br />Brush doesn't spin on the cool setting, wish it did.<br />I know it's more for styling than drying, but I would prefer a little more heat and power to the air current.<br />Already lost the cover to the brush part, clumsy me. It would be nice if it had come with a travel pouch and a cleaning brush at this price point.",2
3,The dressing arrived on schedule and was appropriately packaged.  I am still a novice at sharpening and stropping and thus it is a bit difficult for me to rate the quality of the product.  I have applied it to one strop and it left the leather much firmer than I expected.  The surface of the strop is now rather slick and stiff.  I will need to continue to experiment and use different techniques before deciding if a strop that is dressed with this product works better for me than untreated leathers or leathers that are treated with different products.,2
3,"Overall, a seemingly good intro to DE razor blades. Several reputable brands included. Worth the purchase to get a base level sense for what suited me best.",2
3,"Arrived timely and worked great but broke in my luggage while going through the airport, so make sure you pack it correctly bc the head has many small plastic pieces that can break.",2
3,"Vender issued a full refund after i gave neutral to critical feedback.  I thought the refund was  considerate & very  nice. This product  did fine for me, I was just expecting a lot given other ratings/reviews.",2
3,"after several applications, I cannot really see an improvement in the whitening of my teeth  I would like to add that I just started using this product, so may be too early to measure accurate results",2
3,"They seem to work OK as a replacement, but it seems all replacement parts are a rip, be it blades like this or brushes for power toothbrushes.  A couple of replacement blade sets costs almost as much as the razor.  Problem is that you have to have them and the manufacturers know this, and rip you accordingly.",2
3,This seems to work well for a person's face but I can't see that it does much for the legs,2
3.0,"A little too sticky, I'd go with the GiGi all purpose hard wax.",2
3,Dont know is that magic for this one I am just start use this one<br />but its kind of useful,2
3,I use this to mix in with my foundation when i want a natural glow all over. It works well for that,2
3,"I bought this for a 5 yr. old girl that has the nervous habit of chewing her fingernails...Now she washes her hands a lot and found the stuff washes off...Grandma has been out-smarted-If I could re-apply each time she washes it would work, but not even 'I' have that kind of time!",2
3,good moisture but hard to get flattened out when taking out of package would buy again,2
3,product ascexpected,2
3,"It cleans my face, but havent noticed a difference in skin quality or acne reduction",2
3.0,The paint chips off quickly and it doesn't seem as hot as my cheap conair one I used to have.,2
3,"I've been using it for two weeks now (The facial cleanser once a week and the toner once a day) and i must admit that I see an improvement.  However, the cleanser stings so badly when I use it (and it smells awful) that it makes me wish it didn't work as well as it does.  I've seen great results, but it's actually painful to use the cleanser to the point where I try to avoid using it. (Hence my using it only once a week.)  The toner I like, but I'm unsure if just it will be enough to help me.  I'm going to stop using the cleanser and see if I can get the same results with just the toner because if I'm reliant upon the cleanser for these results then I think I'd rather live with my pores!  (Three stars because I figured that was the average for the two items; since I like the toner and hate the cleanser.)",2
3,they do not grip tight enough.  They fall out of my hair and do not hold my hair when I  put it up.,2
3.0,The spray is brown and makes quite a mess.  When spraying drops can pool on the counter or floor.  And after it's dry it will rub off on anything you put your head on (such as the couch or pillow).,2
3,These are okay but they are not as good as the 'official' ones from Emjoi.  I have very rough feet though so that may have something to do with it.  I will keep them but do not plan to reorder.,2
3,"It was so soft I couldn't stop touching my hair!  I mean wig lol<br />However, it was a bit too shiny. So I bought me a can of dry shampoo and a bottle of baby powder .<br />Dried shampoo made the hair frizzy so I don't recommend to use it. Though, baby powder worked well:)<br />Only con was it shed like crazy. Every time I touched my hair some piece of the hair came off.",2
3,"I got this for my boyfriend so he could try a straight razor.  Its a neat little set, only problem is the bowl was broken when it arrived.",2
3,Doesn't smell or lather like the original,2
3.0,Not the best product for 4C hair especially in the winter months. This product works better when hair is completely wet. It has a quick drying time. The problem is it does not have enough moisture in it for winter months. It reminds me of the old VO5 treatment. When its hot outside it melts all over your face and cam cause acne or skin rash. Not the best situation. This product is not horrible for the price but if you have an emergency and can't find anything else then go for it. It works best for Wash and Go styles especially if you are on vacation and need something to dry fast and quick. For the price you can't complain. It is what it is.,2
3,I thought using this pencil on the inner rims of my lower eyelids would be the only thing I needed to do to look less tired but i was wrong. I still need to use whitening eye drops and under eye concealer as well. Oh heck! you may as well curl your lashes and sweep on a coat or two of mascara! This pencil is not a shortcut to looking more awake it's just another step.,2
3,"I bought all their products available for the split end remedy & while I always love their products, I couldn't say that I saw any marked improvement in the split end dept...",2
3,"I purchased this product at a waxing boutique right before I got a brazillian.  They instructed me to wait 10-15 minutes for the numbing to take effect.  After using it a few times I've noticed it's just as effective, if not more effective only a few minutes after applying it.  Personally I don't think it lasts 30 minutes.  Your wax won't be pain free, it will still hurt.  I think it works well on the bikini line and surrounding areas. I was hoping it would help relieve some pain of more sensitive areas associated with a brazillian.  It helped a little, but I was still bracing myself. The overall numbing effect will differ for every person.  Use of this plus taking some ibuprofen and skipping caffeine before the wax will be your best bet for pain reduction.",2
3,"This is a nice piece of equiptment, but is not really strong enough to dry your hair.  Works best if your hair is mostly dry and you want to finish the look.  I guess I like the old fashioned brush and dryer!",2
3,"I do not use it as I should, I am not one to spend much time on my face.  Would like it better, if I used it properly",2
3,Had a Conair for 10 years that finally died.  This model doesn't seem to be as powerful as the previous one.<br />Takes me longer to dry my hair.,2
3,The Baby Croc Hair Straightener is very compact and does a pretty nice job straightening hair.  Doesn't get quite as hot as the regular flat iron but it gets hot enough.  Great for a 2nd flat iron especially if you don't want to pay the<br />Price for the full size.  Good value for the money.,2
3,The main issue I have with it is the fact that I can't remove the guard so it's impossible to get to the blade and even out sideburns.,2
3,"Love the product, great deal. Leaves my heir smelling great and makes my curls look silkier and more defined. But eventually with the humidity my hair frizzed after a couple of hours.",2
3,"*Update: Color problem was corrected. Responded quickly.<br /><br />Firstly, This item shows blue, but i got grey. Seriously? Might wanna put color options on your products... Need to check out who's doing the packaging.",2
3,This is an okay dryer.  It does the job but the brush attachment wont stay on the dryer and slides off.,2
3,"After a couple of use, the lipstick broke off from the tube. This is the second tube this has happened to. Will not buy again.",2
3,"I don't' see all the excitement sadly about this lip balm.  I was hoping for the best balm ever, but it was a lot like all the others, ok.  It goes on smooth, but wears off, and has not improved the softness of my lips as the colder weather is here.  Bummed.",2
3,"It's just okay, but works much better if you use it with a warming cap or sit under a dryer for 30 minutes.  I will not buy again.  There are better deep conditioners out there.",2
3,"Remembering my Father used this kind of razor, I decided to buy one to see if it would give me a better shave than the disposables and cartridge devices I've been using,  Using this razor makes me appreciate the disposables and expensive, modern blades.  This is a different shaving experience.  With a disposable I don't have to think about how fast I'm shaving or what angle I'm using.  It's very fast and effortless.  Using a safety razor is very different.  You can't be in a hurry.  You have to think about what you're doing.  It's more touchy.  More like an art.  More skill needed.  I can't say I cut myself more, but you have to go slow.  The instructions indicate not to shave against the direction of the beard growth.  But if you don't shave against the direction you don't get as close of a shave.  I find myself &#34;finishing&#34; myself with a cartridge razor.<br /><br />I'm a &#34;newbie&#34; at this.  I'm going to give it a go for a month more.  Maybe I'll get used to it and figure it out.<br /><br />I bought some traditional shave cream from The Art of Shaving with the razor and I'm totally taken by it.  The stuff is much &#34;oilier&#34; than Barbasol or any other shaving cream or gel.  Your face is really slippery when using it.  And it stays slippery even after two or three passes of the razor.  I will continue to use this stuff and I recommend it whether you use a safety razor or disposable.",2
3,Not very pliable and hard to apply.,2
3,"The method of displaying and discussing the product was somewhat misleading. The length of the extending<br />arm from the wall to the first swivel position was not clearly defined. Slightly over 8&#34; extension from the wall mount is not enough to meet my families need. If the manufacturer (JERDON) has other models with an extension from the<br />wall mount of at least 12&#34; or more, would definitely be interested.",2
3,"I remembered having this lotion years ago, but when I bought this and used it the first time the glitter is very coarse and chunky, not all of it, but some of it, just a bit odd, but I'm still okay with the product overall.",2
3,"It's well known that Wahl makes the best hair clippers.  But the accessories that come with this kit are horrible.  The guides are flimsy, and the teeth get caught in various orientations.  The mirror is a joke.  The trimmer that came in my kit is absolutely terrible; its motor does not run at a consistent speed, and it sounds like it is running out of batteries, even when the batteries are fresh.  The oil dispenser is cheap and awkward.  And lastly, the carrying case is bad for organizing all the parts of the kit.  I had Oster clippers before that had a much better carrying case.  This is basically just a bag that lets all of your parts bounce around without any sort of organization.    It's clear that Walh's strategy is to pour all of their energy into their clipper, and absolutely minimal energy into the other accessories.  Shame on them.",2
3,The brush lost some hairs as I was using it. Might want to buy a better brush.,2
3,"I thought the color was more purple towards silver. It is a little too rosey for my taste. The holo is awesome, I ended up ordering Harp On It also from Color Club and it was exactly what I wanted.",2
3,"Unlike our old one that quit working eventually, this one pauses if too much pressure is on the brush while it is in your mouth.",2
3,The bow was kinda uneven and the diamonds fall of also the clip is hard to open but thank you,2
3.0,I like it but the brush is little bit too hard,2
3,this is a great iron for straighting your hair the only problem i have had<br />is it will out of the blue shut off periodictly,2
3.0,"It's a good texture but it makes my scalp itch :( I must be allergic to something in it.  Smells very coconut-y.<br />Great price, makes my curls look good.  But can't keep using it due to the itching.",2
3,I still burnt.  But I am pregnant and I have heart it is easier to burn when you are pregnant.  I will still buy this one though.  I hate the idea of using chemicals on my body.  Just beware to reably a lot.,2
3,"I purchased this mirror last year and ready to replace it.  It has good lighting however it tilts backwards at the slighest touch.  I have to use q-tips to wedge between the mirror and base to keep the mirror at the angle I need.  If it had a better design on the base it would be a great mirror, but for the price it is not worth it.",2
3,"For the price, I think they should make the mirror a bit larger.   If you are serious about using this everyday, pay a little extra and get the larger sized version.   It is great however, its too small, and I have to keep moving side to side to get the mirror to focus where I want it to.     But its a great idea to have magnification, and the light!  I am planning to buy another one, but the larger one this time.",2
3,smelled so good I immediately ordered more.  The problem is the scent didn't last long,2
3,"This is an absolutely beautiful color.  The lip gloss is shiny and looks good.  Unlike some that I've recently tried, it feels really sticky.  On the plus side, it does last a long time.  With the beautiful colors it comes in, I would recommend it at $18 - $20.",2
3,"Of course this isn't going to give you the same look as a spa laser treatment. My skin looks smoother and less saggy right after treatment, but doesn't last. For the cost and realistic expectation, I would recommend this product.",2
3,"Smells like your typical cheap cologne, I just bought it to have something cheapo for work because I have to be around a stinky co-worker that is a nasty smoker.  I hoped this would help keep me from stinking like an ashtray since anyone within 100 feet of a nasty smoker is going to stink.<br /><br />This cologne smells about the same as any other cheap sub-$25 cologne.  I would not buy it to wear out on a date but it is fine for something like what I am using it for.",2
3,If you want very light coverage this is for you.,2
3,"Good stuff, good price",2
3,"It's not flashy, but it didn't cost much and it gets the job done. It also takes up a minimum of space on the counter, which is helpful in my small bathroom. I opted for this over plastic versions since there is no chance of it breaking if it falls to the floor.",2
3,"The moisturizing effects of this lotion is pretty good and doesn't leave behind a particularly sticky film like many other lotions I have used. However, I can't really stand the smell. It took me a few days to decide whether or not I liked the smell or not. I know it already says in the description that it's fruity, but nevertheless, I expected something much more mild given the color and packaging of this product. Maybe it's because I don't like strawberry-scented things since most of the time, they turn out too sweet and unnatural smelling (like in this case)? In any case, the kicker was the lingering, menthol smell after the strongest of the strawberry smell goes away. With the first few whiffs I've had of it, it was actually kinda pleasant because I'm getting over a cold and the menthol kind of helped clear my nose, but after awhile, it feels like I rubbed on melted fruity/tropical Halls cough drops all over me. The smell isn't as unpleasant as cough medicine, but it does still smell a little like medication (mostly like cough drops, as mentioned) - this isn't something I can stand for an extended period of time. Oh right, that's the last thing. The scent stays and stays and stays. It would have been great if it was a scent that I liked, but I just don't like this scent and throughout the day, I would get a whiff of myself and think, \\""Eugh, cough drops.\\"" The smell lingers over my clothes (especially my pajamas)and I really, truly can't stomach this smell anymore. I hate to rate a moisturizer based on the scent, but when it's this strong, overwhelming, and stubborn, it completely overshadows the moisturizing effects of the lotion since I don't even want to be near it anymore. That being said, I do like the lotion itself, so I'm curious about the other scents that they offer. I'm just hesitant over buying another bottle of lotion blind.",2
3,"It seems to work pretty well but it's very hard not to press the control buttons while using it. If the buttons were on the side instead of the top, I would have given this a better review.",2
3,"Not so hot. it is way too drying, but I am going to make my own face cream and this is one of many ingredients I want to add. i think it will add  nicely to the list I have made. I am tired of paying for fillers and ingredients I dont want and need due to various legal requirements.  Guess I am a do it your selfer chemist at heart.",2
3,"I love the telescopic mascara and order it all the time, but this particular mascara was dried out...if there is a due date for mascara to expire, I think this one surpassed its due date.",2
3,Big Mama used it and she told me the next time to go back to Dove. But she has been known to be a creature of habits and sometimes she will refuse to accept alternatives. I do not endorse that sentiment. Most of the times for I do believe competition is what makes our capitalistic system shine and single out the best from the rest. So I am giving this one 3 stars based entirely on the fact that it was not requested again for future use.,2
3.0,Got powder for my mom. Powder tin arrived very dented .  Not enough time to go get another gift for Mother's Day gift. Not happy,2
3,"not good , It  always shake my teeth",2
3,I have been using this soap for about three weeks. I love this soap. I have oily and adult acne and it has done a great job. It has lightened up the dark scarring and made my skin very soft. I am not as oily and i love the smell of the soap.,2
3,"cuts the beard, but takes much longer than with a blade, so to save time a blade is better.  also the temptation to walk around while shaving opens the possibility to scattering whisker shavings all over the place.<br /><br />being able to use the shaver in the shower with soap, shampoo, lotion is a big plus.",2
3.0,"This was pretty, but not what I was looking for. It barely came to my elbow and was very thin. I was going to keep it as a prop for my bachelorette party, but definitely not for my wedding. However sent it back.",2
3,"These two cute little pots of color contain shades that look really pretty. Chastity is my favorite of the two shades. Unfortunately the product goes on with too much slip so it's difficult to get a nice even coat of color. The coverage I do get with these is very very sheer and shiny. The lip brush is useful. I think this product is best for someone who would use a lip lacquer on top of another lip product like a fully penciled in lip, a stain, or a lipstick rather than as a solo product.",2
3,"This shaver is nice and the lithium battery lasts for a long time. The only thing I would say is that if you have thick facial hair still expect the mess from shaving. I have a plug in of a similar shaver/beard trimmer that has a vacuum that is much better at maintaining the mess. This shaver is nice but not great if you were looking to have a shaver that has a quality vacuum feature. Nonetheless the led length indicator is really cool and it does work well. Yet if you have a fierce man beard this will cut it, it just won't catch much of it in the little vacuum deal it's got.",2
3.0,Smells OK. Not for those who suffer from perfume induced migraines. If you use apply in small amounts as smell projects and lasts.,2
3,"This was a gift for my daughter-in-law for Christmas, but didn't find what I was looking for in time. So when I found this I went ahead and ordered it for her Birthday in April. So I am unable to rate this, at this time.<br /><br />I bought one for myself about 4 yrs. ago, from Revlon, that is rechargeable instead of batteries, for around $30. That is what I wanted for her, but could not find a rechargeable in my price range.",2
3,"Not thrilled but not irritated enough with the product to return it either. It was taller than I expected which makes it a bit difficult for a short person to use for a vanity mirror. The lighting isn't really the brightest either. Its more like a soft interior lamp light, but when doing your make up you want it brighter so you don't wind up over doing it.",2
3,"After two or three uses, the top will not stay on.  I had to tape it shut to use it. Not great- would not buy again or recommend it.",2
3,"I have used both Queen Helene Cholesterol with Ginseng and Queen Helene Cholesterol (the original conditioning cream) and the original cream works better for my hair. Therefore, I would recommend the original Queen Helene Cholesterol conditioning cream rather than Queen Helene Cholesterol with Ginseng. The delivery was fast, just to mention.",2
3,IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT FOR ME - IT ISNT HEAVY OR STICKY LIKE MANY<br />IT BLENDS IN WITH THE OTHER DRESSINGS I USE ALSO<br />I CANT FIND IT LOT OF TIMES AT ANY STORE SO I WENT TO YOU ALL<br />IT HELPS BUT GOSH I JUST WISH I WAS BORN WITH THAT NICE THICK<br />HEAD OF HAIR!,2
3,Fast shipping and Good quality!,2
3.0,Not good coverage,2
3,"It was okay... I was looking for the leave-in-conditioner for their Defy Breakage line, but was unable to find it. Still on the search for a good leave in conditioner.",2
3,"After washing your face.<br />Because this item not sticky, I can also be used in summer.<br />I also like the smell.",2
3,not as effective as arm and hammer when working out,2
3,This nose and ear trimmer by Philips is not that bad. The quality of the product is OK and it actually works pretty well as it is supposed to be.     The feel is like of a cheap plastic.  Works very well of the products I used.  The trimmer add-ons( two sizes) are good and is the advantage of having a trimmer with cutting blades like this.,2
3,Fits a larger arm just fine. Like that it protects my hands. I have some sun spots and I noticed they were getting darker. These will help. Now I need to use some fade cream to reverse the damage. Wish I'd seen these sooner!,2
3,I have used this product for only a couple of weeks so I have not seen any definite changes as far as my wrinkles are concerned.  I will say that my skin looks more healthy and has a nice shine to it after I apply the serum.  I will gladly submit another review after I have used this product longer.,2
3,I'm not sure what I was expecting... it curls lashes nicely without pulling them out but to be honest I'm not sure it is any different from any other eyelash curler I've used.,2
3,"Have tried the jet black, the tribal, and the outliner. None of them are really black. More so grey. They do have great color pigments though.",2
3,no bad cheaper than the real deal .. but still feels bulky in my mouth.. it does the job.. but you know its there..,2
3,"Ok. I was new to Bath Bombs just late last year so i went on a testing spree. This review will be the same for each one except the stars will be different.<br />Ok. From best to least favorite.<br /><br />My two best choices are Lush(only one I'm reviewing not sold on amazon) and Moon's Harvest Bath & Body Shop. Honestly i cant choose between the two yet. But both are a complete 5 stars plus some for me.<br /><br />Next. This one. Blissful Bath and Lather and Fizz Bath Boutique. These i think are the same company. Both are a 3 1/2 to 4.<br /><br />Last on my recommended list of good reviews is Level Naturals. They are great quality. My problem is they are small as idk what. Like golf ball or smaller. I had to use 2 at a time which is why im giving them a 3. Scents are Earthy which i like. If they increase the size and keep the same quality, id have them at a 4 with the 2 above. Maybe even a solid 4 because the quality js good. Which would bring these to a second place(not a tie with the ones above).<br /><br />Now for the ones i don't recommend because they are like seriously cheap and a waste of a bath bomb experience. Ps. The ones above smell great, great fizz, good moisture, etc. what you expect from a bath bomb.<br /><br />Hugo Naturals and Village Naturals are the worse. I give them 1 star. Enough said. They are not in the game anymore. I used all 3 village ones that come in that pack at the same time and it still didnt come to a 2 star level. Both are cheap with weak ingredients or something. Ok. Thats all. Time to copy and paste this to all the others. Hope this helps.",2
3,"OK, seemed to work fine. If you don't want to carry a larger roll on than this is option.",2
3,The Soap didn't work for me I was still itchy.,2
3.0,The light does not work!!,2
3,"I loved it when I swatched it on nail wheel, but it was much difficult to apply on my nail.<br />It was a little gooey and lumpy to get even opaque effect, and left streak marks.<br />I'll use it for stamping or something.<br />I thought this would be the best nail polish among all I have, but wouldn't buy this brand because its more expensive yet the same quality as my other ones.",2
3.0,"I've ordered these stamping plates before, some of the designs don't work, which is okay bc they are the ones i least loked anyway, but also found if you use a thick polish the stamps, stamper +scrapper will work! Waiting for mine to arrive will rate when it comes",2
3,I only gave it three stars because I have used other shampoo's I like better for high lighted hair.I will not buy it again because I could not see any difference in my hair color.,2
3,Wouldn't buy it again. Average results.,2
3,"The razor requires cleaning with the manufacturer's product, but the cleaner's ingredient label reveals that it is 98% alcohol with a touch of jojoba oil and fragrance.  Pretty pricey for something that's almost entirely alcohol.  I think I'll try my own mix next time.",2
3,"I gave this a three star rating instead of more stars in that it was offered on Amazon.com as a toenail clipper.  It doesn't open far enough for clipping the average toenail.  If you have thin toenails I think it would do a good job but for most people probably not.  It is a precision made clpper and very sharp, does a great job on my fingernails.  Unfortunately not on my toenails.",2
3,I bought this on someone's recommendation that it &#34;smelled amazing.&#34; To me it's just okay. Nothing wrong with it – nice texture; absorbs well. Just not a pleasing and send for me to want to order it again.,2
3,JUST OK,2
3,Disappointed in the huge air pocket in this container given the price of this product.  Not sure if it's a fluke.  Won't risk it for this price.,2
3,"The perfume smells great, the scent doesn't last as long but worth the price!",2
3,The shipping was very fast and the colors are beautiful. But I didn't know the colors were random so I got 3 of the same colors and not the one I wanted,2
3,Need more  time to  see  how it works,2
3,"I was looking for a night creme as effective as Lancome's Renergie double performance-it penetrates very well.  This failed to do so, but I use it for a body creme...it smells terrific!",2
3,Mixed with olive oil too dilute I wanted the oil of calendula and less diluted for healing my skin I have used this oil before,2
3,"\\""Seven oils\\"" is more a fanciful name than a product description. This is your grandmother's mascara - petrolatum, beeswax, and parabens. At the bottom, it does say the mascara MAY contain several kinds of oil plus iron oxide.<br /><br />The inky black color is nicely saturated. Try not to blink until this dries or it will smear, but once on, it lasts pretty well - again, a lot like the old fashioned kind of mascara. It doesn't lengthen at all but may volumize a little if you put on several coats. Despite the waxy formula, it didn't make my lashes stiff.<br /><br />If you just need color, this is a nice black bargain option. If you need something that will enhance or treat your lashes, I'd say spend the extra money and try elsewhere.",2
3,"In terms of pure function, the product is okay, it trims closer than the Oster T-Blade trimmer that it is replacing. That is the only good thing about the Andis T-Blade trimmer.<br /><br />Everything else about the product is awful.<br /><br />First there is the smell. The first trimmer I received smelled so bad that I had to box it up and return it to Amazon. It stank up my house and gave me a headache. The second is only marginally better. I let it air out in the basement for a week before moving it to the bathroom. After six weeks of almost daily use I still get a pungent acrid burnt smell after each use, but at least the headaches have gone.<br /><br />Build quality. If this was a free toy that had been manufactured in 1960's China perhaps the sharp edges on the non matching halves of the plastic enclosure would be acceptable. Acceptable for a throw away, but not for a tool designed to be used day after day for many years. That Andis ever let a product with such shoddy build quality out the door is testament to the companies complete disregard for product quality. Who ever does quality control (or rather doesn't) must be stuck in the 1940's. I called Andis HQ and asked to speak with someone in QC to find out if my two samples just happened to have slipped out the door, but of course, no one returned my call.<br /><br />Ergonomics. Who was the genius who placed the on off switch furthest away from your fingers, so that you cant flick it on and off without transferring the device to your other hand. Pure genius.  To say that this device was designed by an engineer and not a designer would be to slander 99.9% of a profession.<br /><br />Vibration. It vibrates. Not to the point of leaving your hand numb, but more than I would expect a so called professional level tool to do.<br /><br />So why have I kept the trimmer? Because I have gone through two Oster trimmers which didn't cut as close as this does. The second trimmer vibrated even more than this Andis so my choice is between a light weight consumer product designed to last a few years with a less powerful motor and non removable batteries or this solid 110v, but junkally built ergonomic disaster.<br /><br />I am giving the product 3 stars because it trims closer and vibrates a little less than the competition, but everything else about it is a disaster.ce is between a light weight consumer product designed to last a few years with a less powerful motor and non removable batteries or this solid 110v, but junkally built ergonomic disaster.<br /><br />I am giving the product 3 stars because it trims closer and vibrates a little less than the competition, but everything else about it is a disaster.",2
3,This product is just okay if you are just learning how to apply your makeup. 2 of my brushes have already broke and I barely even used them.,2
3,"This cup is small no doubt. It's great for traveling and does what it's supposed to do, but I will be purchasing something larger once I'm back home.",2
3,"I took stars off the review because I didn't notice any visible toning in my skin after a few weeks of use. I didn't really have a problem with this since I didn't think that it would. Body washes should not be held to such high expectations but I'm not a big fan of false advertising either.<br /><br />This body wash feels good and smells good. I suppose that's what matters. I've also found that I haven't had to use as much per bottle, which is also worth something. The smell is easily the body wash's best attribute though.<br /><br />At only five dollars, this body wash is great for anyone looking to wash themselves with a new scent. Anyone looking for a skin toner should look elsewhere though. Expectations should not be unrealistic for a body wash.",2
3,Had for a little over a year now.  Plates are starting to darken. But that not suppose to happen. Its not suppose change like ceramic painted  Plates. Makes me wonder if this is worth it.,2
3,"The order was received within 3 days, but the box was a bit mangled. Also, it doesn't quite smell the same as the bottle from the department store. It is supposed to be a gift, but I am rethinking this as I don't want to give anyone something fake. I purchased Kenneth Cole (women) in the gold bottle.",2
3,Contouring coverage was not the best.,2
3,I have purchased this product a few days ago and found out what's wrong with it.<br /><br />The product I bought from here is seem not concentrated because I went to see skin doctor and he gave me examples for this product. The one doctor gave me is orange color and I meant way more color than the one I bought from this sellers. and also the thickness of the serum too. I haven't tried it yet but I just want to post this so someone might be able to answer me correctly what's is going on or this seller just mixed with water and resell it.<br /><br />I would like an answer because the different is too much.,2
3,works on my scalp but leaves a residue on it too. i don't like that its not natural at all.,2
3,"I Purchased this cream because of its natural ingredients.<br /><br />Pros: Good moisturizer, feel good factor because it has many natural ingredients, reduces fine fines<br />Cons: Might be a bit greasy for some.<br /><br />Overall good product, which doesn't cause any skin irritations.",2
3.0,Nice product overall but the sciccors were cheaply made. I replace the sciccors with a better product.,2
3,I bought this for luck and it didn't work for me. So I hope it works fo all those of you who really know how to use it. I did not.,2
3,"Can anybody tell me how to \\""open\\"" the dispenser on this Nature's Gate Body Wash?  The first bottle of this, I just pushed down and the dispensing faucet popped up, but this new bottle won't do that.  And the Nature's Gate website is not helpful.",2
3,Lasts for about.. 3 hours? Then you need to reapply.,2
3,"It has somewhat of an interesting taste. Kind of an weird taste, so either you might or might not like it. I've tasted other kale chips before and liked them, and I still think this one in particular has an interesting taste.",2
3.0,Worked on my mom,2
3,"Heavier than otc browl.....I am strawberry blonde and the color is good for me although I have to make sure I don't put too much on, darker than you think.  Too expensive for what you get.",2
3.0,Smells wonderful just too heavy for my thin hair. Would probably work great for someone with truly dry hair (not dryness from damage).,2
3,"I love the scent of the conditioner. It smelled like a mixture of cherries and jasmine. I used this conditioner after the Essential Shea shampoo. I did not have to use a lot. I am African-American with dry, natural hair and my hair soaks up moisture. I was not impressed with the performance of this conditioner. After using it, my hair did not have much of a shine, was not so soft and did not feel moisturized.<br /><br />I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and my honest review.",2
3.0,Wow! I really liked this product but the price jump is just too high. What happened to make the price go from $6.00 to $20.00. Unfortunately for me I can no longer afford this products so I now purchased a cheaper brand.,2
3,THis is another mild fragrance that would fade out near the end of the day. I probably would buy it again.,2
3,"I bought the original razors since they are cheaper than the Venus Embrace razors, but it isn't worth spending less money. My skin is very sensitive, and the original razors irritate my skin. If my skin weren't so sensitive, perhaps these razors would have been a good purchase. So, for those of you with sensitive skin, try to spend a little more money for a better razor. However, if your skin doesn't get irritated easily, these razors should be fine. And whether you have sensitive skin or not, always be sure to shave slowly! :) I hope this helps!",2
3,I have had this for a while (couple months) and didn't see any real major improvements to my dark spots. Some lightness but not very much. Darned! :(,2
3,"Not a super fan of this, I really only tried it for the Bond logo, look, and my employer said I may like it. The scent is okay, but not really my style. It's too stark, almost woody, but not. I can't really describe it well.",2
3,"This product isn't bad...I still use it every day but I definitely wouldn't rely on it to keep you shine free.  I have oily skin, so I usually use this as a base, add foundation and follow with pressed powder.  I'd say by the time I finish my commute to work it's time to reapply the powder.  So if you're looking for something that will actually keep you shine free for any period of time I would go with a matte primer or something like that.  But as a light moisturizer I think it's decent.",2
3,If you like pachouli you will like this spray.  I thought it would be more lavendar.  It still smells OK but I like Bath and Body Works Lavendar and Vanilla Spray much better.,2
3,Gave u 3 stars just because it didn't feel wet enough do I gave it to my daughter she says it's ok so ok then,2
3,"Works a little, but not to the degree a razor would (from my experience at least) so i don't use it all too often",2
3.0,Unfortunately the spray nozzle doesn't work consistently.<br /> Folks when you are spraying your tired feet  with this product after a tough<br />  day  at work & the product doesn't spray well it's a little frustrating. The product<br /> does contain organic ingredients including tea tree oil & it is somewhat refreshing.,2
3,"I used this on my 13 yr. old son.  He has had a sudden out break on the hair line.  I do not want to say that it does not work since he was using something else that I did not know about.  I waited for that effect to die down and have started him this week on the Lavender Water.<br />I am going to give it another week and see how it works and come back to this review.<br /><br />I have used rose water on him and it has kept his face clear of blemishes, but wanted to try this as a night time toner.  He does not mind the smell, but he said you have to get use to it.",2
3,"I wish that ALL the hair was 24&#34; long, so I could practice my braiding technique better, but overall it works.",2
3,Was a little too bright for what it looked like. I would recommend getting a darker color. Does smell delightful though.,2
3,I used this years ago with success. But when I recently bought it again to try it burns my eyes. So I won't be buying it again.,2
3,"What I disliked was the opening for the water vessal, it is to small and you need to be very careful when filling it.  Other that that it works fine",2
3,"[[VIDEOID:mo2F82F3HTH2V93]]I got this before from the CURLS company and never liked it as much as other products (such as 'Kinky Curly' or plain olive oil), but my mom wanted this, so I decided to buy it for her and leave a review.<br /><br />My hair was already (mostly) detangled from the night before. I added water to the section, then the product. It was easier to brush with this moisturizer, but it was a bit sticky. The stickyness goes away when the product is dried, but when the product is dried, it feels like I never really added anything to the hair. o_O There is a ton of shine, however, which is quite nice. I don't really like the flowery scent. It's light and barely noticeable to most, however.<br /><br />Strangely, my mother (4a) loves this product and says it's the best moisturizer I have ever bought.<br /><br />If you're looking into CURLS' other products, their conditioner ([[ASIN:B001OOLONI Curls Coconut Sublime Moisturizing Instant Conditioner, 14-Ounce Bottle]]'coconut sublime') is wonderful for detangling and softening (with no flowery scent).",2
3,I really love all pca products! This particular cream was a bit too heavy for my skin leaving my face oily after applying makeup . I'm not quite as dry as I thought . The silk coat balm is perfect for me. If you have very dry skin this would be a great cream for you!,2
3,very expensive. it´s not worth it!,2
3,"If you read the ingredients list you will see that this cream has pretty good ingredients:<br /><br />Aqua ((water) eau), paraffinum liquidum ((mineral oil) huile minerale), cera alba ((beeswax) cire d'abelle), propylene glycol, petrolatum isopropyl myristate, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, cetyl esters, persea gratissima (avocado) oil, sesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil, sorbitan oleate, lanolin cera ((lanolin wax) cire de lanoline), sunflower seed oil, glyceride, pregenolone acetate, lanolin alcohol, sorbitan trioleate, tocopherol, niacinamide, cholesterol, cetyl alcohol<br /><br />The oils are all very good and plant derived/plant based. Lanolin, unless you have a lanolin reaction/allergy is wonderful for most people. Cholesterol is great for your skin. Tocopherol (vitamin E) is a cosmetic rock star with substance (Beetles rather then Reality T.V. to use the rock music analogy).<br /><br />In short, wonderful ingredients.<br /><br />The price is dreadful. About $15 dollars for 2 ounces is the cosmetic equivalent  of cattle rustling. I would highly advise anyone who is using this product to look at CeraVe Moisture Cream which is about $15 for 16 Oz. and features the following ingredients:<br /><br />Water (Purified), Glycerin, Ceteareth 20, Capric/Caprylic Stearic Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methylsulfate/Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6 11, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum<br /><br />For anyone with any paraben allergies you can try Aquaphor. Or if you are on a &#34;one natural ingredient&#34; kick you can put grape seed oil on your face fresh out the shower. Google the cosmetic cop and check out the ingredients dictionary. It is really eyeopening.<br /><br />My mother swears by Revlon Eterna 27 (for decades) and I'm educating her on being ingredients driven because the price per ounce of this product is obscene. Fortunately companies like Vanicream and CeraVe and ThinkBaby have started to break the &#34;cosmetic cartel&#34; and offer the same or better ingredients at a much reduced price without the fancy celebrity endorsements.",2
3,"Bought this at Wal-Mart and really wanted to love it. Unfortunately it caused little red bumps on my forehead and breakouts on my cheeks. I've never had acne on my cheeks. It's rather thick and leaves an oily residue. Might be good for drier skin types. Very strong scent, pretty, but strong. Will probably use as hand cream as to not waste it.",2
3,I like the easy wash feature since I can run it under the faucet.  Takes a long time to shave as it is not the most powerful shaver out there.  It is value for money though.,2
3,"I bought this shaver a while ago, and I hardly use it.  I bought it to use on my legs and bikini area.  I liked that it could be used in the shower, but the battery does not hold a charge for too long - I have to keep it on the charger constantly.  It also does not shave as closely as I would like on my legs, but I do like the bikini attachment.  I still use it here and there, but it's not my first choice for hair removal.",2
3,"I do use this every night after toner before moisturizer. In the beginning I could tell a difference. My skin felt smoother..I've got acne scars and still get the occasional breakout, but it seemed to smooth it out more. After a few weeks, I noticed the serum doesn't make my skin worse but doesn't really make it better, either. Good for the price, but I'm sure another kind of hyaluronic acid serum would do the same.",2
3,"it's just ok, not the best but not the worst.  have never found the perfect trimmer.  is it out there?",2
3,I like this product but this is a really small size.  No bargain.,2
3,"You get what you pay for. The lashes are really stiff and hard to get to stay on , and unless you are a performer you can't even use half of these because most of them are way to dramatic..",2
3,Spark is my favorite perfume but I was disappointed because I purchased 2 items at the same time and where shipped in 2 different boxes . That the cost of shipping was twice as much. Otherwise I could have purchased more perfume.,2
3,"Dis is a great product! It has a scent that cannot be ignored. When you walk into a room wearing the MAMBO the ladies all make a face of seduction.<br /><br />I love Mambo by Liz Claiborne and I use it on a daily basis. Whenever I use the restroom and then clean my ass in a sink. I lift my cheek and give a nice small spritz to make sure I am fresh for the whole day.<br /><br />I would recommend this cologne to anyone who likes to meet girls, and likes to meet guys. This cologne is for everyone",2
3,"Crest 3D White Whitestrips With Advanced Seal Professional Effects WORKS. However, if you suffer from the littlest bit of tooth sensitive, be prepared for major tooth ache. My bottom teeth were hurting for 2 days straight after 1 strip, and even though the instructions said to use them for half an hour once a day, I found myself using the strips once a week due to tooth sensitivity.<br /><br />I have tried other Crest whitening lines and did notice tooth sensitivity, so it was not a surprise that this was hurt as well. Disappointing.<br /><br />It did gave me good results though.",2
3,Def not my fave hair oil. There are other better brands out there for hair oil. This particular one wasn't all that great. The smell is also rather annoying as it has a a musky wood smell. Makes your hair feel somewhat soft but only for a day or so. I think it dries it out a little actually due to the perfume scent perhaps.,2
3,"Cheaply made,but cute. Wouldn't purchase again due to long wait for shipment.",2
3,The orange smell is quite strong,2
3,they are good brushes i just had to glue the brush back onto a few of the handles ive only tried them once but they seem good,2
3,"First time use dermaSilk, I does help conceal lines around eyes, face & neck. Not sure the small amount in bottle vs. price.  After applying and dry then you use regular creams and a small amount of make up. I'll continue to use it for awhile until I can find  another product that can deliver better. For those unhappy there is no miracle creams or products, lets face age with grace or try botax or plastic surgeon for younger results.  As far Amazon as usual great service!  AW",2
3,"I had tested this in a department store and loved it. So-I ordered it the fragrance does not last for more than an hour, if that. I was very disappointed.",2
3,"the design is convenient and gives good lift underneath the hair when drying.  the issue i've had is the power -- in several uses the motor would overheat and stop after only a few minutes, causing me to have to wait 5 min to resume drying my hair - very frustrating.  when i reported this to amazon, they credited me immediately.  later, a friend who owns one suggested that i turn off the ion button, and i've found that as long as i keep that off, it will keep running normally through the time i need to dry my hair.  of course this means i've lost use of the ion feature.",2
3,Eyeshadow flat brush is too big it is difficult to use and eyeliner brush I don't like it at all .<br />Other brushes is fair good .,2
3,Ok,2
3,I don't own this razor anymore.  The price was too high.,2
3,"I may actually prefer a razor without the flex ball. It was a bit of an uneven shave in some parts, and I had to look in the mirror pretty closely to catch the parts it wiffed on.",2
3,"I have been using Sabino for several months. My hair's roots are natural and the ends are relaxed. I purchased the product to use during my transition to natural hair.  The product is really good for straightening hair and it leaves a nice shine. HOWEVER, when I walk outside for more than 10 minutes, the product does not hold up to Texas humidity. I even purchased the flat iron from the Sabino site.  I did exactly as the instructions suggested and even turned up the flat iron to the recommended temperature.  Within 10 minutes of being outside in the humidity, my natural hair was completely kinky again and the relaxed portion was very frizzy.  It's a great product for a special night INDOORS.  It will hold up to a fun night on the dance floor or even through a workout at the gym so you don't leave the gym looking crazy. Otherwise,it doesn't seem to be a good match for the Texas humidity!",2
3,"Giving a 3 star b/c I do like the consistency, it feels very moisturizing and seems to last all day. It also was the best price I could find (and I SEARCHED) for this brand, type and size of lotion. I have very sensitive skin, and it does not seem to to be making my skin react so that is a positive. I am just not wowed by the &#34;skin clearing&#34; results (or lack thereof). I have alway struggled with acne (nothing too severe, but enough to be fed up) and was hoping this would really help. That said, I am happy to have a lotion that I know has good quality, organic ingredients that seems to be gentle enough for my picky skin.",2
3,Recommend it. works great for the price. a great buy. no bad experiences with it. All positive feedback. Highly recommend it to anyone.,2
3,"I have been using this for the last couple months along with an Olay day cream and serum.  they do not hurt, but I really do not see that they have made any difference.....I do not think they are worth the money to me....you may be different.  what seems to work best for my skin is plain organic coconut oil...not only do I love the smell, but my skin loves it and it does not irritate my eyes.  But the Olay is not expensive, as wrinkle creams go, so give it a try!  it might work better for you!!",2
3,"My 4 and 6 year old girls really wanted this tooth tune toothbrush and I gave it to them for Christmas.  It wasn't easy to get the tune to play even when they were brushing.  Sometimes no matter what they did it didn't play.  It didn't encourage them to brush longer or more often because the reward was so inconsistent.  However, they rocked out whenever it did play and had great fun with that.",2
3,"I don't really like the 2-inch size. I thought I would prefer it because it would be a faster process, however the handling was difficult and awkward.",2
3,"very expensive, not worth it",2
3,"Our only problem, the leg extensions need another hole to extend. They were just a little short.",2
3,"Its a good almond oil, but its a bit liquid the oil, i have had others before and they have more consistency and thickness, so i use more than what i expected to use because of that, it doesn't has any smell, so thats something good if you dont like weird smells on you, i will keep trying other marks until i find the almond oil that fits me more, this one just i can say it was good.",2
3,"It looked like a plane stud earring, but when it arrived it had a ring of silver dots around the table portion of the earrings.",2
3.0,"These were just okay for me. The package arrived safely with no broken bottles, and it did come with a free earring (which I will never wear, but on of my students will probably appreciate). The colors are okay. Some are definitely nicer than others - even with a dark or corresponding base several of these look exactly the same. I gave a few away and my friends who aren't nail addicts like me were happy with them.<br /><br />The colors did last a long time without chipping, so that was a plus for me and they aren't particularly smelly - which you get sometimes with less expensive polish. I like that this brand is cruelty-free and they are reasonably priced. I will probably order from this company again, but I would not repurchase any of these colors.",2
3,This is a nice brush but I was very disappointed when I found the same exact brush at Wal-Mart for $4.97.,2
3,"The string that attaches to the goggles is repeatedly coming undone and falling off. They work when they're tied, but they fail when the string becomes loose again.",2
3,"Lip Venom does subtly plump the lips. It brings a mild, sexy color, and it doesn't taste nor smell bad. It's also less heavy than most glosses so you don't feel like your putting some thick glop on your lips. I do like that fact that it's not too sticky. The plumping effects, for me, were more mild. There was a little tingling but I did not find it painful. Some may. <br /> <br />This is all very well but I do prefer Too-Faced Lip Injection over DuWop Lip Venom. I get better plumping results with Lip Injection but the only bummer with it is that Lip Injection tends to get gloppy at times. <br /> <br />I do recommend at least trying the lip venom because I have seen it work nicely on others with very little \\""ouch\\"" factor on most.  <br /> <br />Go to Sephora and sample it. Wait a little bit and then check out your lips in the mirror. You may be pleased.",2
3,This hair dryer runs very hot compared to the salon dryers I am used to.  The low temp. setting dried my hair just fine.  It also is very loud when running.  I experienced a high chirping sound as well as rushing air sound.  I had to dry my hair with my fingers pushed in my ears.  I plan to solve this problem with a pair of industrial ear plugs.,2
3,"I really like this perfume's scent, however it doesn\\""t last very long. Went with the parfum as opposed to the eu de toilette thinking it would be better.",2
3,"Its a pretty cool razor don't get me wrong. I just would have to say it does an okay job. Maybe it is because it is my first electric razor and it leaves me wanting for more or what. I would say that it is a great pick-up for a spare/alternate for shaving. I did like that about it. I just find myself sometimes going over areas a few times. I don't know but I just feel like it is an okay product and not something that is just calling me to purchase it on a whim. This would have to be complimentary to another shaver or alternate for when you are not able to use a blade. I do not recommend picking this up for a dedicated electric razor. You might be better off looking around first before you decide on this one, or unless you need something really cheap and a must need for that moment.",2
3,"not as sharp as other tweezerman tweezers I've purchased. Maybe these are just a lemon, or maybe knock-offs",2
3,"Painful, but does the job. If you have senitive skin I would not recamend it. It leaves my face red .",2
3,"I bought a new set of these as a replacement.  I bought the old pair from Sephora a few years ago and I loved them, but the tip of the point tweezer chipped a little bit when I dropped them so, I needed a new one.  I thought I was getting the same quality Tweezerman petite tweezers.  The old pair were heavier and the quality was better than the ones I received.  The new pair feel lightweight and cheap. The slant tweezers work fine, but the point tweezers are not sharpened very well.  The tips seem dull and they do not grab hair very well.  Tweezerman quality and craftsmanship seems to have changed over the years.  Don't get me wrong, I love the truly well made Tweezerman tweezers I have from a previous purchase.  I wish they would go back to their original materials and design.  I'll still use the petite slant tweezer, but I've seen better from Tweezerman in the past.",2
3,"I normally don't review but I wanted to add my two cents since all the negative reviews were making me panic about buying this. I found this in a big box store and picked it up. I've never used a bikini trimmer before but I thought it was about time to do some maintenance. It worked pretty well as a trimmer. It thinned out and trimmed the hair nicely and I was not irritated, no nicks or anything using it with the comb. And so far I've had no problem with the battery dying or not charging. However the shaver attachment really doesn't do much good, but if you're going over the rest anyway with your own razor then the trimmer is fine.",2
3,"Once again another Mizani product lets me down :(    Pros: It is very light. This moisturizer will not weigh your hair down. I do like the smell which is a plus.    Cons: However, it's almost too light. I don't think it gives my hair enough moisture, which can be a bad thing. IDK maybe I should have tried the Butter Rich instead. Its also very expensive, i paid $20 for this. I have never paid $20 for a moisturizer before.  I really wanted to like this product. Normally, I love light moisturizers, but Mizani's Coconut Souffle is so light that half of the time I'm not sure if it is working or not.    Update: i hate this stuff!!!! It dries out my hair.",2

3.0,"really like this item, but didn't like the brackets in the back.  would look better if it was a continuous band.",2
3,they are light weight but the texture of the lashes can improve. I wear them on certain occasions. The thinner ones look more natural. FYI to make them last longer use contact solution before you apply the glue,2

3,"I was a huge fan of Oxygenics products throughout the last decade. I recommended them to anyone and everyone. However, I've noticed that the quality of the product has gone downhill. With this particular model, I've had to replace two shower heads three times due to reduced pressure and defective hoses. The hoses come defective from the factory and are very leaky. Customer service is fantastic about replacing them, but the hassle isn't worth it.<br /><br />The water pressure is still very strong!",2
3,No need to spend a fortune on a mundane tool like this.  This was not expensive but very well made.,2

3,black mold inside after a month or so. I'm a long time purchaser of shea butter and have never seen that before.,2
3,"I usually spend upwards of $50 on a blow dryer but this one had such great reviews, I thought, why not? Well, I guess the less money you spend, the less power there is behind the warm air. Because of the lack of power you are looking at a lengthened dry time, however, I'm sure a light breeze is better for your hair. So if hair health matters to you, then this is a good choice, but if you're like me, a working mom, who always runs late, well I need the job done quickly. Wish it had more power!",2

3,Not like i expect,2
3,"Wouldn't &#34;form&#34; even after repeatedly trying.  It would melt and sag in the hot water and it would put it into my mouth SUPERFAST (ouch) and suck, push, etc. and it wouldn't form to my teeth.  Seemed to lose even more form after I took it out.  The end result was about what I started with (like the pic).  Also tastes toxic.  Since I am using it for remineralizing gel and not for bleach, it will be fine.",2
3,"The product worked really well - I was able to wear my hair down 2 days in a row which I wouldn't be able to do otherwise. I have dark hair and it did not leave a chalky residue like other dry conditioners.    However, I did not like using the product because it smelled like something out of my grandmother's perfume cabinet.  If they worked on the scent, I'd be all over this product.  For now, I'll move on to a different brand.",2
3,"Moisturized on par with any other Suave conditioner. Didn't smell anything like mint or eucalyptus to me - smelled like a leaf (and not a eucalyptus one!) I don't really have a dandruff problem, but it didn't make my scalp less itchy than normal.",2
3,"I got this to accompany my merkur safety razor.  After having used it around ten times I post this review.  I am not sure if all badger hair does this or not, but when I use it, even when loaded with soap (Old Spice Swagger Bar Soap) it smells kind of funky.  Not like the soap, but something else that overpowers the soap.  I haven't noticed smelling funky after I clean up, but during the shave I do.  Also, I have noticed some some shedding, not a ton and again this is probably normal but I wasn't expecting it.<br /><br />It is plenty soft and the quality seems good as well.  I guess it was just not as I expected. I know my Dad had a super old horse hair brush and it didn't smell funny and actually worked up a better lather than the one I have.  I have tried two different types of bar soap.  I hope this helps someone.",2

3,"I did read the reviews before purchase.  I received the extensions 2 days before estimated date which was great!  The package was doubled and well put together.  These set of extensions are thin and get thinner towards the ends of the hair strands.  I had purchased a hair extension set at Sally Beauty for about $130 14 inches but I wanted longer extensions for lesser money.  You do get what you paid for.  The ones I purchased here online were supposedly 18 inches, which do not look 18 inches in comparison to my other extensions...  I would definitely recommend Sally's extensions, they give volume, length, able to curl and are a lot thicker than these I ordered.  But if you're on a budget, have thin hair and want a little bit of volume, then these will work for you.  Other than that, I plan on incorporating and sewing some of these 18 inch extensions with my 14 inch extensions.  In which this works for me. The pic I attached, the left extension is part of the hair extension set I purchased at Sally's; the right is from this online seller. I just know which one will last longer and won't come apart easily...",2

But the results were nice. It performs well, and leaves your hair clean and full bodied. But I have to give it only 3 stars, because there are many other shampoos that perform as well, or even better, for a third of the price.  (Aussie or Bedhead shampoos, for example)",2
3,Slippery but good,2
3,"On receiving the brush I rinsed it a few times in warm water after gently applying shaving cream foam to the bristles to clean out the manufacturing oils. I had to return the first brush since it started loosing bristles during the first few shaves and bristle loss only got worse during the third and fourth use. I am pleased to note that Amazon responded immediately, the customer representative was effective and I got a replacement brush sent to me.    The pros.- pretty cheap compared to the rest of similar brushes in the market. A great starter brush, it lathers soap/shaving cream well, retains water well and the bristles are stiff enough for a good shave. A good starter bush.  The cons.- build quality could be better. This brush could be a winner with a large percentage of first time purchaser market if the manufacturers do the 10% needed to address the quality issues. These quality issues make this product a 50-50 instead of a winner.   That being said, if you buy and the bristles come out during the first few uses, return it and ask for a replacement and be sure to add your comment to this board so that the manufacturer knows what word-of-mouth and reviews are critically appraising the product quality. Make sure that you tell them to send a product return label for free shipping. You shouldn't have to pay for returning a product that is not performing as promised. When the manufacturers get sufficient numbers back, they will need to reconsider their manufacturing practices.  NOTE - A few bristles are coming out of the second brush but no where near the quantity that fell out of the first.",2

3,"My sister is the top stylist at a famous philly salon.  I went to her today, she trimmed my long(4 inches past my shoulders), thick (I am jewish and italian)  red (dyed) hair, then applied the product.  She used her pro flat iron, and my hair soaked up the product.  Smell wise, I am extremely sensitive to synthetic smells (I can't use any shampoo, soap, lotion that I don't buy from Whole Foods that is natural) and oddly, this did not bother me at all.  I've been coloring my hair since I was 14, so I was expecting some harsh chemical smell, but noticed none.  My hair smells like coconut now, which is quite pleasant.  Anyway...my hair feels super heavy and does look waxy,but looks super cute.  I'm willing to wait the 48 hours to see how it goes...My sis does the real deal BKT's all the time, and she seemed happy with the product as well.  Keep you posted!<br /><br />UPDATE:  I washed it out, and apparently, all of the magic too.  My hair is softer, but not any less frizzy, wavy, or smooth.  Just feels like I used deep conditioner.  Do not expect this to even approach BKT treatments..I am going back to my sister next week for the real deal.  There's a reason why this is so cheap! Save your money.",2

The brush is decent, but not top drawer, and the ultra cool polymer (plastic) brush stand is not really going to fit in with the rest of my stuff.  Soap?  Not worth writing about.  Just like any soap that comes in a set like this, it's probably best to save only as a backup.  It's an ok deal, but I think I probably overpaid a little for what I actually received.  YMMV, but I really thought it would be a little higher quality for being more than $50 for this little set.",2

3,"Clarisonic Mia....I think I agree with the other reviewers about this skin care brush. Its nothing more than a fancy rip off. I bought it as a Christmas gift to myself because I love buying beauty products! I'm 27, have normal skin with small pores and very minor acne. I use Benzamycin( benzoyl peroxide and erithromycin) at night for any blemishes. I wanted pimples underneath skin gone (on forehead and some on cheeks) and for blackheads because those are my favorite to pick. I don't take the time to exfoliate so I thought the Mia would be perfect for that purpose. I made a visit to Clarisonic's site a few times before ordering. Originally, I was planning on getting the Clarisonic Classic b/c it has a charging cradle but I ended up going with the Mia. Not to mention I couldn't justify spending $195 on one product. Upon arrival, I followed the directions to a T. I wet my face to begin, then applied cleanser ( I use Mary Kay). Afterwards, I usually wipe my face down with a warm washcloth to make sure all residue is gone. Bottom line: Not impressed, skin has stayed the same. Knock on wood, I haven't seen any out of this world breakouts so that's a plus or I would absolutely be returning it. The \\""sonic\\"" part is such b.s. Its just a gimmick to make you think your skin is getting cleaner. All it does is vibrate and make noise. After first use, I looked at the brush head and its stained from removing my foundation. It makes it look dirty. I wish Clarisonic could have made a stain resistant brush head. :( I'll admit is nice to have and it looks pretty but not really worth the money. (Also I did not get mine from Amazon).",2
3,This cologne is just ok. Does not seem genuine. Scent doesn't last very long at all and the box had bar codes and information removed or cut out from it. Seemed like product was repacked/re-shrinkwrapped too.<br />It was fairly cheap and came fast + it was packed well so 3 stars. I'm afraid I will not be buying this product again.,2

I decided try it out on freshly washed hair that had plenty of conditioner on it.  My results were alright, the Detangler worked pretty well on the back of my head, the tool was hard for me to hold on to once I got to the top of my head.  For the sake of time I used the tool on about half my head and then starting just finger detangling instead.  I noticed that by me being a left-handed person, it was much more comfortable to use with my right hand.  I even tried turning the tool upside down and both ways were more comfortable right handed. That was a little disappointing, because it would have been nice to be able to flip the tool and be used comfortably with the left hand. In my right hand it does have an ergonomic/ comfortable feel to it.",2
3,This set is very small (I was expecting it to be similar in size to the Naked sets but this is way smaller). The colors are very nice but they're all squished together and they're different widths. It's hard to grab one color at a time. Also slightly too shimmery since all the colors are pretty shimmery. Would be nice to have a mix of a few matte ones in there.,2
3,"Chose product since Bosley does hair implants and thought product would have same philosophy in &#34;augmenting&#34; hair on the scalp.

3,"If the plastic wrap containing the 6 items had been opened from the other side, I would have returned it then, As it was, from the side we pulled from, the first three to come out of the wrap were perfect, but when the fourth was removed the dial on the bottom dropped off.  The fifth and sixth are the same way.  There had been no damage to the shipping container and no damage to the items themselves, but half the order is unusable unless we find a way to attach the dials.",2

3,My hair felt great after I used this shampoo/conditioner a few times...but if you lighten your hair...it will affect the color and make blonde hair look brassy and dull.,2
3,Let me start off by saying that for the price of this item it has a great scent. It was exactly what I was looking for. It has that backwoods outdoors smell to it. My problem is the lack of length. I know the term you get what you pay for here. I just wish that you didn't have to spray it on every hour in order to keep the scent going. When it is going though I have got some pretty nice compliments from it.,2
3,"If you have sensitive skin, be very careful about Taun's face cream. It's packed with supposedly good stuff - it contains several compounds such as retinol, peptides and esters hat are scientifically proven to help with aging skin. However, just because this cream can dish it doesn't mean your skin can take it.<br /><br />I had some decent initial results - my skin looked a bit smoother and brighter than before, however, it wasn't long before my skin reacted negatively. It's been several years since I've suffered from acne, but this cream caused pimples to appear on my face including in the crease between my nose and cheek, and on my eyelid!<br /><br />The rest of my face and neck feel very itchy and irritated after a couple of weeks. This cream is like a steak - it's dense and intense. I've switched back to using coconut oil as a moisturizer - greasy but easy. There's a lot of hype on here about this cream, but please don't drink the Koolaid. This is not the silver bullet of anti-aging creams for men, especially those of us who have more sensitive skin.<br /><br />Update 6/17/2012:<br /><br />I've continued to use Taun's, but with a twist. I now apply a layer of virgin, cold-pressed coconut oil on top. This has stopped all the itchy irritation I used to feel when I used Taun's alone. Taun's has not eliminated any wrinkles or lines, but it has made my face look smoother, and hopefully will help prevent more wrinkles in the future. It's still the most comprehensive cream for men out there, with scientifically proven ingredients, and I've made it work for me.",2

3,"The price of the fimo canes and the amount was what really convinced me to purchase these canes. I paid around $12 (including shipping) for 200pcs + blade. When the items arrived I was really excited to open the package and finally try out nail art with fimo canes. Well when I opened the package I was really surprised to see how small the canes were! As someone who does tons of research before purchasing an item, I knew that these canes were a lot smaller than those from MASH, etc. The canes were less than 5 centimeters long and .5 centimeters wide! The one good thing about these is that the assortment is really good and I received only 4 duplicates! The designs are really nice, but had I known of the size prior to purchasing them I would have probably ordered the MASH set. I will still be using these in my nail art , but will probably in the future place an order for MASH. Hopefully this helps someone make their decision.",2

3,It is called &#34;Juicy Red&#34; so it was with some surprise I smeared it on only to discover it is a clear lip gloss with the slightest of slight tinge of red.  If you expect a red gloss don't make this purchase.  If you're looking for a gloss with the barest hint of red this one is for you.,2

Sun protection is a must on lips because certain glosses will amplify harsh UV rays-so any product that combines hydration and sun protection intrigues me. I purchased the menthol and orange varieties, neither of them had an over powering mint or orange smell/flavor (like lip smackers or certain Bath and Body Works products).<br /><br />However, both varieties wore off very quickly and I found myself reaching for a more hydrating lip balm after three applications in one day. This is advertised as a lip balm-and not a gloss, but it is worth mentioning it adds very little to no shine or color. Additionally, I did not notice any odd taste coming rubbing off my lips.<br /><br />I will most likely not buy this product again-but it has potential if re-formulated slightly.",2

So, for the price it's ok. It has many shades and it also includes primers (green, yellow, purple). The coverage is not the best. It's on the sheer side. Also the colors on my skin look lighter than in the pallette.  The texture is really thick and is hard to blend. If you are on a budget and really need many colors of concealer go ahead and get it. But if you are looking for good coverage this is not the pallete for you.",2

3,"I purchased this lotion because I wanted something soothing for dry hands and for use after showers, and I needed a scent suitable for both men and women. I have very dry skin and need to use lotion often, especially after shaving. The scent of this lotion is pleasant and unisex, and it is very inexpensive (at my local drucstore the bottle is huge for the price I pay!). It absorbs reasonably well and is better than other cheap lotions I've tried, but it doesn't penetrate really dry skin or help alleviate razor burn; mineral oil (a petrolium product) just doesn't sink into the skin as well as good seed and vegetable oils. I am now using [[ASIN:B001ET72ZW Avalon Organics Lavender Hand and Body Lotion, 12-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)]], and like it for its fast absorption and pleasant scent that is suitable for both men and women. It is sold at many drugstores and also at Trader Joe's under the Trader Joe's label for a much lower price.",2

3,"I've recently switched from high end department store beauty products to natural products.  I am a stage performer which means I have to regularly deal with heavy duty high performance makeup... which leads to my sensitive skin.<br /><br />I have light-to-medium cool asian skin tone, and sensitive combination to oily skin (dry in winter and oily in summer), so I wanted to invest in products that I can use on a daily basis that doubles for skincare.  I do expect natural products to be more challenging to work with, which I am happy to accommodate.  I have come across excellent organic beauty products, but unfortunately, this Sculpting Trio isn't one of them.  The texture feels very light and silky, which is good, but pigments barely hold out.  I would have to pile the bronzer and highlighter on respectively areas on my face to get a bare minimal contouring result.  The highlighter powder looks so lovely in the box and on the back of my hand, but on my face, it barely does anything.  I will continue to use this as a finishing powder which works well, and I haven't broken out - however, there are ample organic finishing powders I would like to try out in the future instead.  Also, the shipping had caused this particular powder to crumble, which was a shame.  I have nothing against Physicians Formula Organic wear products, but I probably wouldn't bother re-purchasing this.",2

3.0,"I've loved all of the Crest 3D White toothpastes ever since they have started coming out many years ago.  I've tried other name brands to attempt to save a little money but I have always come back to Crest.  No other toothpaste has made my mouth feel so clean, fresh and bright!  The Luxe Glamorous was no exception to this this rule, but I ran in to a big issue with it.  Shortly after switching to this Crest 3D line I was finding that my teeth started to have a blue tint to them.  As I am psychotic about keeping healthy teeth this freaked me out.  It almost looked as if my teeth were dying (the grayish, blue tint) or as if my gums were receding and veins were starting to show.  The blue would usually appear when some time had passed since my last brushing.  It was most prominent in the morning when I first woke up.  Sometimes I could scrape it off of my teeth, but sometimes it just disappeared in to my gums while trying.  It continued to get worse and worse until I couldn't take it anymore and researched what it was.  I had no idea that it could be occurring from my toothpaste - but that's exactly what it was.  I actually found endless articles about the use of polyethylene microbeads in toothpaste - Crest being a huge contributor to it's use.  Although the use of the plastic is FDA approved, it can trap bacterias in your gums and lead to other mouth problems/diseases.<br /><br />I immediately stopped using this toothpaste and went back to the 3D Luxe Brilliant.  Within a week all of the blue particles had disappeared from my teeth and gums.  All of the 3D line of toothpastes use polyethylene but I only had a reaction and residue while using the Luxe Glamorous White.<br /><br />The good news is P&G (manufacturer of Crest) has decided to remove the plastic from all of their toothpastes within the next 6 months - but a firm deadline of 2016.<br /><br />In the mean time, I would go with a different Crest 3D product until you see the ingredient removed from the box.",2

3,"I love this color and yes, it does last longer on me than regular nail polish.  Not a week, but about 4 days with no chips.  I also like that it can be removed with regular, acetone free nail polish remover.  On the negative side, you cannot use a base coat.  I have tried, and it chips within a day on my hands.  The reason we wear a base coat is so that the intense color does not discolor finger nails.  That plus is lost with this polish and after removal, my nails had a distinct pinkish tone which I do not like.  If discoloration does not occur on your nails, then this will be a great polish for you.",2

Yes, the strip leaves my nose feeling smooth and tight as if it did something to my nose, but I am not sure it is actually doing anything.  It seems to function the same as putting a Band-Aid on my nose and pulling it off.  Maybe I have strange pores or something, but I just can't be excited about this product when I see no visible results.",2

Because they're pretty fine, I did expect to see SOME improvement based on what I've read on the internet.  Well, I honestly can't see ANY difference in my wrinkles.  I gave it three stars because it has seemed to help a little with some redness I have around my mouth.  But just a little.  I'm going to continue using it (for a while anyway), and if I notice any changes, I'll update.  Update 7/3/12:  I stopped using this because although it did seem to help with redness, I've started to notice a darkening of some of my pigmented areas.  I can even see freckles starting to become faintly visible on my bottom eye-lids.  The only time I've seen that happen was when I spent a little time in Arizona. I haven't been outside, and I live in a non-sunny region, so the only thing I can figure is that the BQ is influencing my coloring.",2

I called again and they asked me which toothpaste I was using. I told them Arm&Hammer and they said in the manual that toothpastes containing baking soda or peroxide or abrasive cleaners may damage the plastic housing thus void the warranty. Doesn't leave many choices for toothpastes.,2

The colors were cute and coated my lips beautifully. Truly no matter your skin tone the colors work with it instead of against it. It would have gotten a perfect score if not for the fact that as soon as the keys slipped out of my pocket onto CARPET it SHATTERED!!! It was horrible. The color splattered (it's soft anyway) and the hinges and little locket broke. My happiness was short lived, less than 8 hours. I kept what I could of it just because the gloss is super amazing. However if I could do it all over again, I probably would ONLY if I could find it reasonable priced on ebay, for say less than $5 including shipping. Otherwise the fragility makes it sooo not worth the money.",2
3,"Lovely purely white cream. Rich and thick. A little goes a long way, truly. However, even though its fragrance-free, there IS a slight smell that is offputting to me. It does well at moisturizing, but of course the price is ridiculous. BTW, I bought the 4oz size.  UPDATE: I took the helpful hint of another reviewer. Thanks BTW. I mixed in 15 drops of lemon essential oil. Now the smell is divine. After I use the jar, I will post another update. Personally I bought this only to moisturize. I don't expect anything to help with my wrinkles except good nutrition and staying out of the sun.",2
3,"I agree with the other people on this review thread. The product is very thick and does not rub into your skin, I'm assuming because of the sunscreen component. I've used it a few times now and by the end of the day my face is still sticky and goopy and it apparently &#34;makes me look sick.&#34; It is also hard to put my mineral makeup on as the makeup does not want to spread over my face, it just sticks to the moisturizer.

3,The result did not show like the one they were talking about. I still have hair that can't not be remove by the cream.,2
3,They are ok for buzzing with no guard. If you are balding or bald these probably wont cut short enough to your liking with no guard.,2
3,"The dress is very much like the picture. Make sure you note that this is a very good dress. I ordered it for a friend who is about 5'5\\"" and it fell pretty high on her thighs. The sequins at the top seem a bit scratchy but no more than you might expect. The delivery was well before expected which is always a bonus especially for overseas shipping. This is not the highest quality dress but it is good for the price.",2
3,"nice product but not as soft as i would of liked. it pokes my face every time i use it and I've had it for half a year now. I'll definitely look into other brushes, bu this brush does spread the powder well onto the face.",2
3,"I'm only giving this item 3 stars because the night light does not work.  My contractor installed it for me; however, as far as the hair dryer itself ggoes, I'd give it 5 stars!  Every woman should have this one in her bathroom,  It's handy, neat because of the cord storage, snd really works fine.  I'm hoping by the time I have my other bath done, it will be made in beige.  I like to co-ordinate my colors.",2
3,I have very curly frizzy hair and this product did nothing for me. I used more then half of the bottle and it still didn't do well I had to use my other products. For a product to cause this much it should do everything it says. Safe your money,2
3,"This product far exceeded my expectations.  The quality was excellent, the color was much richer than I imagined and the leather smell was superb!  I will definitely be a return customer.",2
3,A little dry and not as easy to put on. It could be that it was not a fresh mascara?,2
3,"Shipping took a lot longer than expected.. I got two of the same pen and the metal part of one of them fell off as well.<br />Fortunately, I was able to put it back together.<br />I'm still pretty happy with this product though, for the price it's still pretty good.",2
3.0,The blades are not very sharp.  Not sure if I like this razor.  I am on the fence.,2
3,"I had used Doak's  Acid Mantle for years to control eczema. For some unknown reason, Acid Mantle has disappeared from the internet I saw several reviews that indicated Risabal  was a comparable replacement. It is pricey and is definitely not as good as Acid Mantle but I use it anyway. I will probably not buy it again.",2
3,Expensive thing considering it is too small...but finally I liked it fragance endeed. I will not buy it again until you triplicate the volume of this product.,2
3,"It is okay, never a good idea to buy cologne unless you had already had it at one time. But, it did smell good and i like it. So it wasn't a loss really.",2
3,Its not horrible but its not amazing. Just your standard run of the mill lotion. Nothing too moisturizing about it. An overall average product.,2
3,"The first time I opened one it was a gift from my mother, and it was dark and went on smooth ans easily I LOVED it! A week later it was beyond dried up! I've had different colors like the plum and the teal that last for 2-3 months and other colors like black and brown that dry up after a weeks use. If you leave the cap off over more than an hour you might as well throw it away instantly.",2
3,Doesn't work extraordinarily well in holding up my big hair. Does a decent job of making my hair flow in the general direction. No replacement for wax,2
3.0,its ok,2
3,"I dyed my hair a few days ago, and it's true you have to rinse it for a very long time.  I washed it for the first time since dying it and there was orange everywhere.  The color?  Still not sure.  It's a mixture of burgundy, oranges, and in the sun...pink.  Kind of cool, but not at all natural.  Plan on keeping it a few more days to see if it grows on me.  Was hoping for a deeper burgundy, that I usually get from nice and easy.  But that fades in a few washes.  My hair is naturally a medium brown, so maybe it was too light for this kind of color.",2
3,I'm almost done of my first tube and I'm waiting for the best result<br />It moistures my face,2
3,"it's ok. smells horrible, but supposed to be with healthy ingredients inside. I'm white with thin curly hair and I use it on my hair. My daughter is mixed with thin dry fro and it does nothing for her hair. I use the same line shampoo and conditioner for her and works great. I probably wouldn't buy it again because of the smell. This leave-in treatment feels like water on her hair. but on mine it helps define my curls w/out making my hair look greasy.",2
3,"This worked for a minor change in shading, but to say that it actually whitens, that's not true.  As for sensitivity, at times you will feel sensitivity but not like other brands that i've tried.  However those other brands have whitened my teeth.  By the way I ordered two of these and was charged shipping and handling for separate orders, when they came in the same package.  It's worth 99 cents and ended up paying close to $10 for each with shipping and handling.",2
3.0,Meh.  Not as sharp as other blades I've tried in the same price range.,2
3,I only gave the dryer 3 stars because it is the second one I have purchased and it simply doesn't get as hit in the lower heat as the first one I had.,2
3,"I've only had it 2 days so will update. It is very yellow, but light weight and would need multiple coats to see the color. I used it under eye, on eyelids and blemishes. Under eye okay, didn't like for eyelids creased too quickly and blemishes so-so.",2
3,Didn't care for these the colors are very pasty looking.,2
3,"I figured I would try this.....It's available locally at several retailers, and I like other AC products. AC advertises this as a medium hold product. My hair is about 4&#34; long on top with shaved sides, and this did not provide any hold at all. I have wavy hair and have to blow it straight. This pomade brought the wave right back. The shine is nice and isn't too greasy looking, but I need more hold. I'm sticking with Layrite and Suavecito for my water based pomades.",2
3,The case is to to be placed inside the pocket .the glass that I bought doesn't really fit right into the case and that you need to place them in a way for you to secure that the case is closed,2
3,I thought that the Alabaster Flask would be much bigger than it appeared.  It was suppose to come with five packets of oil.,2
3,IT SMELLS VERY GOOD. IT HAS A RARE SCENT TO IT. BUT STILL SMELLS ELEGANT. I GOT THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY MOM. WHEN IT ARRIVED IT WAS SOO SMALL..MY MOM EXPECTED IT TO BE BIGGER EXCEPT IT LOOKED LIKE A SAMPLE BUT ANYWAY SHE IS CURRENTLY USING IT WISELY,2
3,"Not worth the money, it broke within a week. If you use it lightly, maybe it would work for you.",2
3,"I would like this product a lot better if it didn't smell bad.  I understand that they don't want to use heavy perfumes, but the addition of a pleasant essential oil would go a long way toward making this product easier to buy again.  It seems to perform as well as the comparable StriVectin product, at a much better price, but I'm having a hard time getting past that smell.  :-(",2
3,"If you're looking for a floral yet very pungent incense with a long burn time you would probably like this. Certainly a decent product, but my tastes prefer other flavors.",2
3,"Having been a fan of the Josie Maran argan oil for a while now, I was excited to get my order of Poppy Austin, since it's much more cost effective. But while the oil itself is lovely, it smells *exactly* like kalamata olives, and the smell is quite strong to my nose. I use argan oil as a general moisturizer as well as for my face and hair, and while this brand is probably fine for the latter two uses, it just won't do for the rest of my skin. I'm a perfume lover and I can't have &#34;eau d'olive&#34; interfering with my scents. Back to Josie Maran!",2
3,"I expected to see at least a little pink, but it's almost clear. I had to apply 4 coats before to achieve kind of milk color.<br />I think it would work great for french manicure.",2
3,"I LOVE the design & didn't give it all the stars as I have been using it less than month & the piping on the magnetic closure edge is already coming apart. The magnetic closure like another person commented on is weak but so far it stays closed, just hope over time it doesn't weaken less.<br />DARN IT!!! I have looked & searched all over & the quality of the rest of the wallet is great.",2
3,"I have been using this for only 3 weeks and I have not seen any improvement. Its not worse but not better.  And, the smell is sooo strong its just too much",2
3,Not as good as I had hoped for. A little too heavy.,2
3,"Its not really blue. It looks more black/indigo color than anything. It could be a really really dark blue as it has a small shimmer of blue in it when held up to light. It nothing against OPI, i love their nail polishes, i am just not a fan of this color",2
3,The scent does NOT linger its a NO go.,2
3,"Product is ok, not as good as other name brand fiber lashes but if looking for an everyday I would recommend.",2
3,"It's a lifetime supply of clipper oil.  Unfortunately, mine did not come with the orange cap on top.  Needless to say, once I opened the bottle, I have no way of sealing the bottle.  I must now make sure it stays upright and hope it doesn't leak.  Good quality item, but I wish it had the tip.",2
3,"The price was right, so i bought it hoping it would work with my later model Waterpik - but it doesn't accommodate the nozzles I have.  One of the previous reviews said that it would work, so I decided to take a chance.  I can't use the handle, but at least I was able to splice the cut hose back together using the nipple provided with the new hose.  I corrected most of the original problem with the old handle, which was excessive water leakage, by taking it apart (it is ultrasonically welded and has to be cracked open) and replacing a small O-ring inside.  Then I Super-glued it back together.  I'm sure this product would work just fine with an older model Waterpik with corresponding nozzles.  The 3 star rating was given to reflect all these comments.",2
3,"This is just a volumizing shampoo. It does nothing to stimulate the scalp, balance pH, or cause hair to regrowth like Bosley or Nioxin.",2
3,"Seems to work okay but, don't see any great breakthroughs in terms of whiteness.  Perhaps, my expectations are<br />unrealistic so must consider that,  too.",2
3,"A pretty good product, good for beginners! I started using the flat blending kabuki brush and there was some shedding. on one of the brushes there were some strands of hair longer than others. Hoping they hold up but I won't be mad if they don't last too long because they were quite cheap.",2
3,The stud is for a piercing gun not for just free hand but it will get the job done if you needing to re-pierce.,2
3,They worked just fine.  Make sure the heads match the model of your razor.,2
3,"I loved this diffuser until it broke. I carry this in my gym bag, and it been in use for about 6 months, so it may get jostled a little more than one for home use, but it broke. The metal center popped right out, and now it's useless. Until I find the metal center and pop it back in I can't use this...not loving this item at this time.",2
3,The oil is not as dark and rich as another argan oil I have purchased.  I thought I would try this because it is cold pressed which is the better oil and the price was good.  I will use this but I think I will look for a better cold pressed that is not so thin.  The price is good for what you are getting,2
3,"The item arrived on time, that is always a plus. I was disappointed when I opened it because it looks damaged on the Handel where the two color meets. Whatever it's been glued with it's all over it but dried up so it must have been like it before shipping. I needed to use it right away so I decided to keep it anyway, but I'm not 100% satisfied.",2
3,These are very inexpensive and when you get them in the mail (warning they take a LONG time to ship) you will be able to see that they are not the best quality. I have to admit I have never seen fake eyelashes that actually look plastic. But for the price you cant really expect anything else. I bought them to put in a Bachelorette Survival kit and I think they will be fine for that!,2
3,This is ok really dosent last real long.,2
3,"I've been using this for 3 days now, and I'm just beginning to see some color. This is the first self-tanner I've used, so I can't compare to others, but there definitely IS a smell, and I wouldn't classify it as particularly pleasant. As for the shimmer, I noticed for the first time when I was in direct sunlight that I was super glittery. Even in normal lighting, you can see tiny sparkly flecks. I don't mind this; in fact, I think it's really pretty, but I doubt guys would appreciate it. Overall, I neither hate or love the product; I'm just curious to see how much color I can accumulate with continued use.",2
3,"I have thick hair.  The blades easily clog in the shower and I spend more time cleaning it than I do trimming.  It does what it claims.  I would like more efficient blades and maybe a larger trimming head.  I like how it has blades on both sides of the head.  The part in the middle, like an electric razor head, trims below the skin surface.  On wet skin, it gave me a bit of razor burn, even with soap applied.  All in all, it works well and does what it claims to do.  I'm pleased.",2
3,Ok but would not purchase again,2
3,Bow ties are great but did not get the sorting box that was supposed to come with them. They arrived on time and look adorable on the nail,2
3,"You can buy this here, and it says it ships \\""prime\\"" but you can't get it in 2 days. You will get it \\""free\\"" (meaning it will come included with your prime shipping) but it will not come shipped within the 2 day shipping. (Don't count on in for Christmas, and don't use Amazon's shipping dates for Christmas! I learned that the hard way! Best give your mom the I.O.U. And the gift card to the upscale boutique where you ought have purchased this in the first place!) It will arrive to her doorstep in the Amazon packaging, and it will send a tracking text to your phone. Both a plus!<br /><br />Escada is a lovely fragrance, and that it still sells in 2009 when Escada releases a new fragrance every year every season says something. My mother made sure I knew it was the 2003 RED bottle she wanted. Magnetism does have staying power! If it's the RED bottle from 2003 she wants, that's the bottle you should buy. Perhaps you should order it a bit farther in advance than I did, however. The price was good here. The tracking text to my phone was nice. The speed, NOT a plus.<br /><br />I was lured in by the \\""Prime.\\"" It does NOT come 2 days because it is NOT actually coming from Amazon. It's from a second vendor through Amazon. I ordered it late, and it will arrive by January 4th, a full 10 days after what it said it would be when I ordered it. The shipping is free, and included in the Prime, but no where NEAR December 28th, the day it SAID it would be there when I purchased it.",2
3,"I suppose I should have known by the weight, but I wasn't thinking. The box was very small, maybe 7 in x 3 in x 2 in. The product was nice, but it's not a lot for the price.",2
3,"The argan oil is a great product it does wonders for frizzy hair. However go for the larger bottle, I was stupefied when I saw the size. This must be a sample because noone, except me, would be dumb enough to pay $14 for this.",2
3,"I Like the way it exfoliates. It smells good, but it kind of dries my face out. I only use it once a week when i need to exfoliate my face because any more than that will dry it out too much.",2
3,Great costume wig.. for Halloween,2
3,"I usually only buy the sandlewood and nag champa fragrances, but decided to try some new ones.  I didn't like all the 'flavors' but found a friend that did.  Worth trying if you aren't sure which fragrance to buy.",2
3,This wasn't a bad product but I just didn't see enough results to warrant spending the money on it again.,2
3,"This is a great product for the category it lies in. But in the theory of combating bad breath this product only receives 3 stars.<br /><br />Bad breath is caused by bacteria in the mouth. Bacteria lives in plague which is in between the cracks and crevices in your teeth. The best solution is brush after breakfast (not before) and floss daily. Flossing removes plague, which in turn your mouth produces saliva which removes the bacteria that causes bad breath.<br /><br />This product is 70% or 140 proof drinking alcohol with the flavor of peppermint. Alcohol dries the mouth, which in turn reduces saliva thus reduces your mouths natural ability to remove bacteria causing bad breath. Solution? Buy an alcohol free mouthwash or buy sugar free gum as chewing increases salivary flow.<br /><br />I ended up putting this in the guest bathroom.",2
3,This is the second one I buy.  The previous one came in hardened plastic container that could be used for storage.  This one came in a flimsy disposable plastic wrapper.  I hate to see this sort of corner-cutting in products.,2
3,"purchased this bath scrub instead of the one i usually (dead sea products) get, because it was larger size and cheaper.  The smell is not near as good as dead sea and granules are smaller.  It is ok but for a few more dollars i prefer dead sea salt scrub.",2
3,Mirror is too small.  Cannot see all of face. Should have gotten larger mirror.,2
3,Blades are very nice but the wait wow....,2
3,need to use 2 clips to keep bangs off forehead. 1 is too small even for my baby girl's fine hair.,2
3,I like it but the smell can be a turn off,2
3,"Yes, it does clean your teeth, but it is a bit big for a small mouth and it is very noisy.",2
3.0,It took a long time to received the product. I liked it though. Thank u,2
3,"after reading all the reviews I decided to try this product over one that I had used and purchased previously and loved...I like this product but am disappointed in it.  I thought my hair would be straighter like it does when I get my hair done from the salon; this product states it is professional quality.  I do have thick course hair, but it never seemed to be as straight as I like the day I straighten it, it looks much better the next day after been slept on.  I would rate this product good value for the price.",2
3,"This is a nice color and YES its nude but its more of a light pink/ nude. Stays on pretty nice, but if you eat with it on it starts to look ugggggggggggggggggggggg. lol when it arrive it looked kinda melted ;( that could of been a reason",2
3,"When i got these I thought they were other Stone Creek glasses I had ordered previously and love.  These are okay, but I don't care for the design or fit as much as I like the others.  These are too racy, slanted, unflattering to my face and not as comfortable.  They work ok though.  If you like them, they will be fine for you.",2
3,"The bottle is listed as a &#34;spray&#34; bottle; but, it is not.  It's a pour bottle and I went out and bought a spray bottle to use.  The scent is perfectly beautiful, though.",2
3,Would be nice if numbing action would last longer.,2
3,"good product, but too expensive. not to knock the product, but the people selling these items are charging way to much.",2
3,this is very nice cream for mild acne and also can be used at a night for a light night cream.,2
3,The video is very graphic. This kit is for hard wax so do not buy the cotton strips. You are actually yanking the wax wen it dries. I think I let the wax heat too much - that's the tricky part. It stained my bikini line.,2
3,"It looks nicer in the picture, although it's still pretty nice.  It's a light material glued to a hard plastic headband, and I found it pinched rather badly and I can only wear it for a couple hours at a time.",2
3,Wish I didn't!,2
3.0,"If you're looking for a good value package of deodorant this is a decent deal, though if you are looking for the cooling action of some of the right guard line of products, these don't have it. I guess I'll get back to that action when I run out of my 6 pack",2
3,"I won't order again bc it smells so much like Chanel 5, and I have that..I don't remember Antilope smelling like this in the 70s!  So, that's why I only gave it 3 stars. I remember it having a more musky scent!",2
3,"Sometimes I love this foundation, sometimes I hate it.  You canNOT have dry skin whatsoever when wearing this or it will cling to every little flake.  When my skin is really soft and moisturized it looks great.",2
3,"I've been using this product for about two years now and normally it's no problem. It's gentle, doesn't sting eyes and does a great job of cleaning skin...as long as you do not wear makeup.<br /><br />Yesterday I was practicing contouring my face with foundation and highlighter. Came out nice, but I digress. When it was time to wash it all off, I had to wash, and wash, and wash, and wash and wash and still makeup came off when I used witch hazel afterward as an astringent. So they really need to remove the tagline about deep cleansing. One of the products I was washing off was Wet and Wild Coverall which does have staying power, but it shouldn't have taken that much product and time to remove it.<br /><br />This is not a good product for makeup removal. For powder mineral makeup which is my norm, it's fine. Anything more, I need something else.",2
3,"Nice soap, it really is... But it is extremely sweet smelling, as in sweet like you have never smelled sweet before. On a scale of<br />1-10, the strength of the smell is an 11. I can't say I highly reccomend it, unfoertunately it is just a bit strange that soap would smell that pungent. It must have 200mgs of sugar or more in it, almost like raw or concentrate mango juice. Too expensive for what you get here. But if that does not bother you, it looks to be of nice quality. Otherwsise check out some coconut soaps, etc., or try your luck elsewhere!",2
3,I'm skinny girl and it looks too baggy on me. And the quality is not so great.  But my mother do like this wrap.,2
3,"I've had this for years and I'm just now doing a review ... lol! When I first received this product I did notice that it was somewhat sticky. With that said, I started off using this as a flat iron spray for my AA natural hair and it was ok for a while until the stickiness started to get to become noticeable and left a film on my hair. From there the product  became my blow dry spray. Although this isn't a completely bad product, it didn't provide my hair with any kind of moisture and because of that it has been phased out of my hair regimen. I can attest that the smell was pretty good and it wasn't a bad detangler which is why I was able to continue using it for as long as I did. By the way, when I got it, it was 10.50 so I definitely wouldn't repurchase it at the price it is now. If you catch it cheap ... it is worth a try.",2
3,"I have severe fungal infections in all 10 of my fingers, and since I have no insurance, I decided to buy this product to try to manage it on my own. it shipped fast, I bought it on Tuesday, and received it the following Friday. The box was smashed and opened when I received it, but there was no visible damage to the product. It did not come with any instructions, but it wasn't hard to figure out how to use it. only 1 of the bits fits in properly, the others just slide all the way down, but I've made it work. sometimes when I touch the buffer pad to my nail it stops, but if I increase the speed, it works better. I'm a little peeved that all the bits don't fit properly, but I bought a cheap item so I didn't expect actual salon quality. This is a fair product if you're short on money, or if you don't plan on using it much. If you have the money, I suggest you buy something higher quality.",2
3,I bought this as a gift for my mom's birthday. She didn;t use it for very long before the zipper broke. Kind of a bummer.,2
3,Beautiful colors. Like all of her makeup- great staying power. I wish there was more matte colors in her pallettes.,2
3,The area I have to cover is pretty large. I have bald spots. Dark brown hair. I ordered the brunette and it's too dark. I haven't had luck with any kind of powder or the fiber kind. So I've given up on powder for my head. Really wanted this to work.,2
3,"My hair is med-fine texture and tends to get frizzy in the spring and summer.  I used this conditioner and at first it felt good.  My hair was detangle and somewhat smooth.  I didn't see much shine like I normally do when I use Argan oil but thought it would come over time.  After several uses, the conditioner has left a heavy build up in my hair.  My hair looks limp and without body.  Still no shine.  I am not sure this is a conditioner for my type of hair.  I think this would work best on coarser hair.",2
3,"Great price as compared to what you would pay in the store.  As for how it works, kinda like a &#34;super gel&#34;  I prefer the putty  ones more",2
3,"I love the color, but it is a matte color -- no shine to it whatsoever.  I prefer colors with a brighter tone to them.  All in all, it's a pretty color!  I was just expecting something shinier.",2
3,"This product is advertised as a two-in-one, (face) wash and shaving gel. As a face wash, it's OK - not a great smell, but cleans OK enough and rinses easily. As a shaving gel, the instructions say to add more of this product than one would use while washing. The big problem with this used as a shaving gel is that it absolutely does not lather up to allow ease of shaving. I had to finish with another (actual) shaving gel to finish the shave.",2
3.0,I really thought I selected the 3.3oz bottle for $11.39 to be added to my cart. Instead I receive 1oz Bottle for the same price. I really wanted the 3.3oz bottle!,2
3,"Smells like French parfum... which we really like, yet it seems to lack something.  Not very distinct, just kinda like a good generic perfume smell.",2
3,"this product had no instructions. I am glad I found some information on Amazon. I do not know whether you rinse it off or not. I would assume you don't, but anyway it does make my skin feel real tight like a mask. I only paid $4 for it at Burlington so whether it works or not I did not spend a lot of money.",2
3.0,"Well the product is great... but you better don't need to replace the shaver's head ( $20 ) simply absurd !!!<br /><br />I have to replace it since after 6 months the head begins to lose the main net,so no way to continue shaving.<br /><br />Think about it.",2
3,Unclear how to change out the blades.  If you have better instructions on how to change out and install the blades I sure would like to have them.<br /><br />boseimmp@msn.com,2
3,omg i need to have 15  words ..not sure i can do that. sure like it ..it was a little to big..she cute it down,2
3,"This lipstick is just okay.  It gets REALLY dry after about 10 mintues of wear.  The color is amazing and it feels wonderful when you first put it on, but.... you really need to carry a gloss if you don't want your lips to feel like they've been kissed by the sun in the Sahara.<br /><br />I actually ended up throwing this out after 3 months because of the dryness. :(",2
3,It's ok. Not my style. Light clean smell. The smell gone after a few hours. I like rose one better.,2
3,"This product is quite convenient and quick. Moreover, we can use it to shave hair without using shaving cream since it doesn't cause scratches like regular razor. However, it is noisy when it is turned on. Additionally, it does not shave the hair as clean as regular razor does. Therefore, we would have to spend more time for shaving. Most importantly, its price is too expensive. It should have other special features to make up for the price.",2
3,This works great for my redhead with dry hair but not for my brunette with straight hair. Makes her hair look dirty and limp.,2
3,for sure does what it is meant too and well but is a lot smaller then expected for 10 dollars i expected it to be a little larger,2
3,The quality is OK...It was bought for my 10yr old to play dress-up in.  Good enough for that.,2
3,Very pretty. The length of the material could be longer.,2
3,"Wished more info had been put in the online description.  The elastic is only a temporary hold.  They work, but they aren't great.",2
3,too big  size I need small size,2
3,Good value but it doesnt clean the hair so good.,2
3,"Have used this 3 times now, and see no difference in my skin. I dont have any specific skin issues - just wanting to look a little refreshed and well moisturized. This product has not delivered. I have used other products from this line that I loved - this is disappointing; pretty much like putting clear sticky gel on...I even left it on for 20 mins. Will try the Eminence face masks next!",2
3,"What inventory genius decided that all four heads in this multipack should be the same color?  In the past (and we've been with Oral-B for years) each head in a multipack either came packaged with a number of different colored snap-on  rings or, came with a different colored ring already on each of the heads. In either case, it was easy to tell which head belonged to whom in our household.  No more folks...each of the brushes in this multipack has a white ring!  Now, we have to use the position of the brush heads in the storage rack on the charger base to determine whose is whose.  Dumb!<br /><br />By the way, these brushes do work well and they do make for a clean feeling mouth.  But the deal killer for me with these heads is noted above.  We will cancel our next order for these and go back to one of the other heads.",2
3,"It reminded me of Clinique Happy. I didn't think it smelled like grapefruit. Very citrusy, but too much of that orange-citrus sweetness for me. I was looking more for a grapefruit scent. It's a clean, light scent and I'm sure that those that like Clinique Happy will like this. It came on time and in a cute tiny blue bottle. I'll still keep it around in my purse.",2
3,"The mirror is beautiful but the 'crystal' teardrop just looks like a big plastic gem (which isn't a big deal to me, just letting you guys know) so not quite as elegant as it looks in the picture. Maybe it should have a slightly iridescent coating or something to make it prettier.<br /><br />My only real problem is that when I opened the box the mirror was broken! I wish the packaging were more secure to prevent this: there was no foam or bubble wrap or anything inside the box. I had it shipped to Trinidad and Tobago via skybox so to avoid the hassle of returning it I just had a mirror cut to the right size and shape and stuck it on the broken one... but I really wish I didn't have to go through that at all.<br /><br />The Magnification is perfect... anything more intense would be too much and fortunately, that side of the mirror was fine when I opened the box.",2
3,I like this product but it is a very loose powder. I still use it for highlighting and contouring but since the consistency is so powdery I know it will not last long throughout the day.,2
3,"this is a fun product and good for costumes.  It is a bit messy, as it came out on clothes, jackets, car seats, etc.  It's not natural in the least, but fun for a costume or a sports fan.",2

3,"It warms the towels a little,but not as much as I thought it would. I wanted it to be very warm.",2
3,"The product is okay -- quite painful at first, with minor irritation, but not bad compared with other methods e.g. shaving, nairing, etc. <br /> <br />Recommended usage could have been better articulated -- ensure your hair is as short as possible prior to using the product in order to mitigate discomfort.",2
3,I just got my razor today through a free promotion from Gillette.  I really enjoyed the weight and feel of this razor but I'm not 100% sure that the vibrating handle actually did anything or if all the credit goes to the blade.  I still like the look and I will continue to use this razor and replace it with a similar one should anything happen to the one I have.,2
3,OK as serums go but doesn't really firm the skin.,2
3,Too strong; it would have been a great fragrance had it been bit mild.,2
3,"Wish I could do 3.5  It's ok...it does the job, but I don't like it as well as the one that I have had for years that I replaced it with.  That one was a Revlon, but since the recent Revlon curling irons aren't getting great reviews, I thought it would be better to try a different product. There's something about the staying power of the curls that I don't love.  My hair gets silkier, which is not a bad thing, but it's like it loses all texture and doesn't hold anything, almost like when I flat-iron my hair.  I have had similar results with another ceramic product, so maybe it's the ceramic factor?  Because it's still fairly new, I am still experimenting with different products and processes to get it right.  Another thing about this one is that the stand comes up 1/4 of the barrel when it's extended, so when you try to wrap your hair around the wand, it gets caught on the stand.  Very annoying.  So either you can work around it (but my hair is much too long to not use the whole barrel), flip it up and down when you pick up/set down, or just not use it at all.  I just use my curling iron without the stand and I rest it in the bowl of the sink.  It works ok, but it really shouldn't come to that.",2

Big disappointment for the price that I got only four months of use out of it.",2
3,Product is acceptable.  It is a little more stiff than similar products.  Perhaps I need to give them more to soften.,2
3,the product quality is very good but the colors were too dark .  I would recommend for someone with much lighter skin than mine.,2
3,"I loved the product but, you don't get much for your money",2
3,Since i am 73 i noticed in the past year that my hair had thinned quite a lot and  this product gives my hair a fullness that i had lost and is only needed to be applied once a day.  it helps to hide the fact that my hair has thinned so much that you can see the scalp.,2
3,"Hair drying gloves are just OK - not the greatest thing since sliced bread - which is what an article about them that I read led me to believe.  They work slightly better than a towel, but not much.  And now I've got one more thing to dry/store/deal with - unless you like having specialty stuff to make you feel pampered.  The quality of the Studio Dry gloves is good, so there's no problem with this brand - I don't think another brand would be any better.  I've used them for about a month on both waist length hair and shoulder length hair.  My hair is fine but thick, so maybe they're more effective on other hair types.  I thought they'd be perfect for me as I don't use a hair dryer and live in a cold climate, so hanging out or going out with wet hair is not ideal.  But overall I'm disappointed compared to the hype.  The gloves are extremely warm, so if you have cold hands you might enjoy them, as long as you don't need to use your fingers and don't mind feeling like a muppet.",2
3,"I purchased my SECOND shower floss recently. The first one lasted about five years with daily use, and cost about half of what I paid for this new one, shipping included. The product works well in removing food particles from hard to reach places between my teeth. (I have very hard water and that is the reason that the first shower floss died). The entire unit probably costs less than $3.00 to make. I down graded this purchase due to the over &#34;high price&#34; for the unit, and the unbelievable &#34;cost of shipping&#34;.",2

3,"I tried this product a while back.  What I liked about this product was that it gave me an instant tan.  However, the instructions said that I had to wipe the tip of the spraying gun after every spray.  Also, I had  to protect the surrounding furnitures with newspaper, so that they wouldn't stain, so it wasn't too convenient for me.  Other than that, I thought this was a different tanning product that worked.  I stick with the tanning lotions though.",2

3,"I bought this lotion but have only used it a handful of times. I have used it in a tanning bed and outdoors as well. It is my 'backup' lotion for when I run out of my better stuff. I actually used this the first time I went tanning this year, and none of the bronzers showed up, so I guess you really have to slather it on. I know it has bronzers in it because some leaked out from under the lid and dried and it's a dark brown.<br /><br />I really recommend this lotion for beginners or people who don't want to go tanning often and spend a ton of money on a more expensive lotion that won't be used much. This lotion is very hydrating and goes on smooth and has a nice consistency. The smell is also pleasant, and no burnt after smell, which is why I rated it three stars. If the lotion had not been advertised as having bronzers in it, I would have rated it five stars for a decent tanning lotion, but since the bronzers don't show up good, I had to take off 2 stars.<br /><br />So basically, if you don't want a tanning lotion with overwhelming bronze, this is for you. As a lotion it's great.",2
3,love the matte color but the polish goes on kind of chunky,2
3,I was all about getting these things when I read about them in Redbook... But they aren't as amazing as they sounded. They don't wipe away eye makeup (even waterproof) in two swipes like the magazine said. Shoot! I was super excited but they take just as much patience as any other eye make up remover. The great thing: they don't sting my eyes.,2
3,It is darker than I thought. Also it's very thick and a bit hard to spread.  Not buying it again.,2

3,I loved the shower gel but the the spray is just okay - you can smell the fragrance but .. its not very strong -- I wish it was stronger or lasted longer.,2

3.0,"Update (5/30/16): I've had this product almost 1yr (about 20days short of a year) and the poor quality is showing. It is beginning to dry out in the middle making it crumble & difficult to use. It almost looks like what happens if you drop water in a makeup powder pan (i've done that before--&#34;d'oh&#34;), how it gets dark, rough, and difficult to lift with a brush but that's not the case here. I haven't hit pan yet (the metal pan it sits on isn't showing), it never leaves my house, it is always housed in my makeup organizers atop my vanity along with all of my other products and this is the only only that is having this happening. My other makeup products are higher end Fashion Fair, Mac (lots of mac), Urban Decay, Smashbox, etc. I have some Mac powders that are so old I probably shouldn't be using any longer but even those don't have this issue, so at not even a year I'm a little disappointed. However considering the cost, I still say it's &#34;okay&#34; and just use a sponge and a little more effort to lift and apply. Unfortunately since it does not seem to last I probably would not buy it again.  This is great for contouring. I use it over my cream foundation stick (that I contour with) to give a softer appearance in the daytime, around the bridge of my nose, and perimeter of my face. I'm a MAC nw45 and this is a great contour shade. You can build it up a little for drama or keep it subtle. There's no glitter effect, but a subtle bronzing. I would NOT use this as a face powder or as a typical bronzer. It's just too dark, but I knew that when I ordered & I ordered it for contour.",2

3,"Doesn't work all that great and if you apply pressure to get it to file better, it stops the wheel entirely.",2
3,"I bought this because I thought these new barrels were better than the old curling irons.  I will say it heats up fast, stays evenly heated, and is easily interchangeable.  The glove provided is pointless and awkward.  If you need a glove I suggest buying a full one instead of using the 3-finger glove provided.  Also, there is no mechanism to prevent the hair from sliding down the barrel.  Furthermore, since I have to hold the hair, I can't achieve a curl to the end of the hair, so every curl has a straight end.  This can be OK sometimes, but I would like more variety.  I give this 3-stars merely for the functionality and not the quality.  If you like clip-less barrels, this was a good buy for the money.  I'll probably go back to regular curling irons in the future.",2

The charge indicator will only stay in the green zone for 2 or 3 shaves and then goes red. I have a light beard and my shaves are short, I never use the turbo mode and rarely use the trimmer.

The Wet Brush is well made & fantastic with wet & dry hair but the Sharkk is not.  The Sharkk Brush has weak bristles and works okay with dry hair but when I tried to brush conditioner through my wet hair the bristles went flat and the conditioner went no where.  After I towel wrapped my hair I thought I'd give it another try on wet hair and, again, the bristles went flat.  I paid $5.oo more for the excellent Wet Brush (very happy I did so) and lost $4.oo on the Sharkk.",2

3,"I received the Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle from Gillette to test and review.  As I've come expect with Gillette's products, the shave is close and comfortable.  My skin, which is sensitive and has been subject to irritation with other razors, was completely irritation free with the Proglide.  The Flexball was an interesting twist - it gave me better control of the direction of my shave, something that resulted in less shaving over the same area of my face.  My only complaint is the size of the handle.  I understand that the batteries have to go somewhere, but I find the width of the handle very hard to grip.  At times I found myself fumbling just to keep the razor in my hand.  I'm still using it and I hope to find a satisfactory way to hold it because the shave is outstanding.",2

3,I suffer from mild dandruff. I can keep it under control by using a typical Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%) shampoo every other day. This product is no different to me as it uses the same proven active ingredient and drives the same positive results.<br /><br />Pros: This one has a nice/strong minty scent and does create a nice/slight tingle when using. It washes clean and I've had zero flakes while using the bottle.<br />Con: The bottle is a pain to open and when it is nearly empty it is a pain to get the last bit of shampoo out of it.<br />Bigger con: The cost per ounce vs. some of the competing products is high. Nothing comes close to 40 ounce pump bottle of Head & Shoulders from Costco.,2
3,I'm hopeful about this product but it is too early to give a review.  It's been 2 weeks and I have not yet noticed any changes or improvements.  I would expect that one must finish the 1st cycle of 6oz rubber bands and then 8oz to see if the product works.  I will provide an update after the fact.,2

3,"Well, I've owned this razor for over a year now and I think I'm going back to my old Norelco 9160XL (similar to the current 8200 series).  What don't I like about the Arcitec model?      1) It's loud--loud enough for my wife to complain in the  morning when she is still trying to sleep.  It is much louder than my 9160 which is nearly silent.   2) I don't think this new HQ10 blade set cuts as well as the HQ9 set.  I believe I get a closer cut from the old razor, and with less effort.  I find it easier to shave my neck with the 9160, which is exactly what I had hoped the Arcitec would do better, but it doesn't.  3) I don't like the hair trimmer design.  The design on the 9160 (and current 8200) is much better.  It's much more convenient to use and it trims better.  4) It's nearly double the price of the 8200 series.    What do I like about the Arcitec?      1) I like the design of the handle much better.  It's thinner, longer, and feels better in your hand.  2) I can get about 1 month of daily use out of a single charge.      If it was quieter and it cut better I'd highly recommend it; but it doesn't.  If I had to purchase a new razor today I'd buy the 8240. By the way, I've been using Norelco razors for decades.  I've not had any problem whatsoever with my razors since they moved away from NiCad batteries (at least 5 years ago).  The old razors batteries used to die and they were not replaceable, so you'd have to throw the whole thing away.  But this is now very much a thing of the past.  I highly recommend the brand.",2
3,"So far I rate this a 3 as it has not been the miracle I was expecting, but I do think it helps some.",2
3,It's ok doesn't have a curve like the picture shows but still good.,2
3,"Great product, but did not flow through my hair like the Conair products.",2
3,It falls off very quickly. I love the color though.,2
3,"I'm not sure if this really does anything. I put it on my skin and then begin to rub it off after about 20-30 sec. As I rub, it starts to ball up into greyish little balls of &#34;skin&#34;. I don't think it actually is skin, but rather the product balling up and helping to exfoliate your skin. It does make your skin feel a little bit smoother. I'll continue to use it because it is gentle and makes my face feel a tad bit smoother but I probably won't order another bottle.",2
3,Doesn't work. Don't waste your money.,2
3,"It's one of the best looking brushes I've owned, and probably the best made. This brush is made in Great Britain, and is adorable. I love the pink rubber where the rounded bristles poke out. The black handle is cute too, with the gold-plated writing.<br /><br />I bought the D-31 brush, which is supposed to be good for detangling curly and kinky hair. (I am a 4A/4B type). If you're a natural looking to purchase a Denman for detangling the D-31 is good for detangling ALL TYPES (but preferably short to medium length curly hair). On the other hand, the D-41 is the better choice for THICK, or medium length to long hair. I bought the D-31 because I thought it would be a better investment.",2
3,"I was not \\""blown away\\"" by this product.  It's okay & I will use what I have, but won't buy it again.  The smell is very strong, not a bad smell just very strong.  It does not have the instant bronzing in it so you don't see immediate results.",2
3.0,"Feeling of Sticky and Greasy is not happy for me. I am going to change to red bottle, the regenerist cream.<br />though I like the sun screen function.",2
3,I think.this is a pretty decent hair dryer. I thought the air would be stronger but it  does the Job. And gets hair dry quicker than other hair dryers.,2
3,"works good , but wont last long .  have to reapply often",2
3,"From the description, I expected that this product wouldn't flake or be dry but it is pretty dry.  The hold if ok but I'm an African American woman with short hair and I'm looking for something that will lay the hair down and smooth it out with shine.  This doesn't really do that so much.  It's not a bad product just not what I was looking/hoping for.",2
3,"It has a distinctive smell, similar to lanolin, that I have not been able to cover up with mixing with coconut oil and essential oils. I will try mixing it more with beeswax next...I do love it for it's moisturizing properties, though.",2
3,This is a great product but it slightly breaks me out. I would recommend this for anyone that has normal skin.,2
3.0,They were ok,2
3,"The dryer works just fine but the switches are ill-designed. The switches are located in an awkward position.    First:  the blue \\""cool\\"" button is where your fingers rest so when you are drying hair and easily rest your fingers on the cool button, you blast the dryer on the cool setting.  This is very annoying and you have to get used to not pressing this button.    Second:  in order to turn on /off the dryer and turn the setting to how you want, you have to get used to doing it from an awkward position in the back of the handle where your fingers are holding the dryer.  Once you get used to it, it's not a big deal, but it's constantly annoying trying to turn on/off the dryer from this position.    The power of the dryer is great; it's powerful and the dryer works well but I wish the buttons were designed better so that I didn't always hit the cool button and that the on/off switch were easier to turn the blower on and off.",2
3,"So my husband bought this as an Xmas present and gave it to me early. I had one bottle that had leaked, which might have been caused by shipping...who knows. I love all the color combos. I was a little bit disappointed that they weren't for base coats and the bottles were a bit on the small side. My husband had no idea that they weren't meant for base coats. He is a man after all...I don't expect him to know. The color did take close to an hour to dry and with 2 kids, it's a bit of a pain...but overall a small price to pay for the cute colors.",2
3,"I don't look younger or older after using the product, it is not really an effective wrinkle filler for me.",2
3,"I think they're okay but I feel dumb about buying this product now for the reason that I wasted $28 on this when I could have bought them individually for $2 or less. So just a heads up if you want this product just get them individually from some other seller. Just saying. But I used the sponges this morning and well theres nothing to special about it, brushes do the same thing this sponge does.",2
3,"This polish is quite thin and runny. In order to create the effect in the picture you'd need to apply at least 4 coats. I applied 3 coats and still didn't quite achieve the results in the picture. As with most of these quick dry nail polishes, the first coat dries very quickly but additional coats take longer. By the third coat it took at least an hour before I felt safe enough not to dent the finish. I liked the polish but didn't have the patience to keep applying coats.",2
3,"I understand some hair products are only guaranteed if they are purchased at a salon, I don't care for salon prices so I thought I would try online. Much cheaper, but my hair didn't feel as smooth or sleek. I ordered two pairs, maybe it will be the same after I use the first pair up.",2
3,"My husband died suddenly, he used to put lotion on my back after a shower or bath, not what it seemed",2
3,My experience with these was good at first. After about the third or fourth use they had cracked .leaving me with soar pinch marks .,2
3.0,bristles fall out easily,2
3,Great kit and 9.00 cheaper than Target and Walmart. Light/medium shade is very dark. I had to return.,2
3,"I love the smell and the tan that it gives but as some bronzers will do this one turned my palms, toes, and in between my fingers orange.  I have used other bronzers before without this effect but I now know to thoroughly wipe those areas well after applying before getting in the tanning bed. Other than that, love the \\""push\\"" that it gives my tan.",2
3.0,"cheep but ok for the cleaning packs. for 144 teeth brushes its ok, really cheep though",2
3,"I'm not sure I understood that I would only get a fancy powder box and puff that contained no actual powder.<br />I love the puff and the box, however what I really wanted was the powder.",2
3,Sometimes the it takes a little bit of &#34;fiddling&#34; to change the heads but otherwise no complaints. Comes with a useful set of attachments and the lithium battery has been great-the unit never bogs down.  I would have given it 4 stars if it came with a travel bag.,2
3,Nothing happened,2
3,"I have terrible scalp psoriasis and initially when I started using this, I found it to help a lot, then after I got my hair colored... not sure if this effected my scalp with the heater machine they use at the salon, but now my itchy flaky scalp is back. I'm gonna keep using it until I run out and see if it starts to work again. Otherwise i'll try another product.",2
3,"Feels nice at first, by after a couple of days using it, my face got really dry. Now I use two timse a week at most and then it seems okay.",2
3.0,This item is very good.  Once I learned how to use it without spraying myself and the mirror.  I like the idea of being able to adjust the pressure for cleaning in between the teeth. It is easier to operate than one that runs from a resivoir.  I would like to see a ball cock put in the line to shut off the water. Otherwise it is an excellent product.,2
3,To be clear- I haven't used the product for more than the one time the brush touched my face. I guess my question would be... is the brush goat hair? Because I owned goats before in my life and let me tell you... that brush smells EXACTLY like a goat. HORRIBLE! I made the mistake of putting it on my chin first (who knows why) and now the smell was directly under my nose and it didn't go away until I washed my face again. Yuck. To be clear- its not the make up that smells.... just the brush. Count on throwing it away the second you get it... unless you like your face smelling like a goat.,2
3,Got here quickly.  Seller sent a reply to my email promptly. The expiration date was rubbed off but I decided to try it.  Maybe it's just my skin but I got itchy spots and had to get a shower to rinse it all out.  Please don't go by my response.  It could just be my sensitive skin.,2
3,"Pros:  -smells amazing  -heats up quickly   -comes with TONS of strips  -sugar based wax so water soluble  -easy to use esp. for beginners    Cons:  -stiffens quickly even though still hot (will need to reheat)  -doesn't get out coarser hair    Overall I would say that this product decently works.  I'm a beginning self-waxer and this was easy to navigate with no mess. I only had 1 minor issue with this wax (which I kind of anticipated but wanted to try this anyway).  Because it is sugar based I didn't feel like it harden enough to really \\""trap\\"" coarse hair.  I have a small amount stubborn, thick hair and none of it really came off.  If you have coarser hair I would recommend using a harder wax than any of the sugar or honey varieties.    The product works wonderfully on normal hair.  And I love that it is water soluble.  It makes for effortless clean up on your body (sticky fingers included) and on any hardware spills.  Also if you need more strips (which is doubtful because they give you more than enough) you can just wash out the used ones and air dry them.",2
3,This thing is really small. I would not order it again. I wish they had one 10X bigger. That's all I got!,2
3,I like the way they heat up fast and are very comfortable. My only minor issue is that they don't seem to make lasting curls.,2
3,"Can't see that these are any better than my store bought sponges, they are firmer and easier to find but I felt fine discarding my other ones and despite washing these have a hard time feeling as if they can be disposable.",2
3,"It is matte when you first apply it. Also it smells a lil funky, but if It worked I would be fine with that. But about 3-4 hours into my day it gets just as oily if not more oily than I normaly do. Not impressed. Nor will I repurchase. Good for short periods of time though. Like a photo shoot or a trip to the store.",2
3,I don't see much efficacy in this product.,2
3.0,"I have a mixture of 3C, 4A, 4B hair. This product is okay but you can't use too much or you will have white residue all over your hair when it dries, (embarrassing) and your hair only last for 2 days. Its great for the health of your hair but unless you have the time to wash & style every 2-3 days it's a lot of work. I brought the clarity shampoo, twist defining cream, leave-in hydration conditioner and the curly jelly, about $80 bucks. In my opinion it's not worth the cost. I do a lot of twists outs and found that Cantu curly cream shea butter for 5 bucks gives you a great twist out without leaving residue. Love the name of the product but the price should definitely come down.",2
4,Very good product for the price. It does a pretty good job of trimming. Not as much power as a corded item would be but very acceptable.,3
5,"Good stuff, really works on weak nails...but you should apply just about every day.  Keep it near your tv chair and you'll apply more often if it's at the place you relax.",3
5,I bought this for a 1920's dinner and am in love with it! I actually think I may start wearing this headband regularly :),3
5.0,"I can't wait to buy more, this is an excellent product",3
5,This is my second hair brush like this!  I love it.  I bought one for my nieces since I love mine so much.  It definitely is great quality and very durable.  It also does detangle hair amazingly well!,3
5,"I received a sample of Simple Protecting Light Moisturizer from Bzzagent, and I love it! It only takes a little bit to cover my face, so the small bottle will last a long time. The lotion is light, and it's designed for sensitive skin, so it's not irritating. I love using it after my shower. It makes my face feel so smooth. I would definitely recommend this product to someone looking for a facial moisturizer with some sun protection.",3
5.0,good,3
5,It is better than I expected,3
5,"I get a great shave with kiss my face and it is not an overpowering smell.  The pump pick up tube should be longer, I have trouble getting the last of the shave cream.",3
5,These brushes are so soft! Washed them multiple times and they haven't shed a single hair. Intact delivery by Senyx. I highly recommend them!,3
5,"I have to admit when I heard about this product I was thinking &#34;yeah. Right…&#34;. But after a friend suggested I try it for my daughter's fine hair that tangles when you look at it, I purchased one.<br />Pros: Easy for a child to handle, easy for an adult to handle<br />  DOES take the tangles out with no pain.<br /><br />Negatives : I can't think of any.<br /><br />If you have hair that is kinky, curly, knotty etc, this is a fantastic find.",3
5,is a good product and fit all the different tattoo guns that i have also good quallity for the price definitely worth it,3
5,"I have very thick dark hair that will also frizz some at the thought of humidity.  I've tried probably 30 different hair products (paste, gel, spray) over the last 10 years or so to try and tame the hair monster.  Most products either leave my hair sticky or hard as as rock.  Then I found this Pure Clean pastes and my decade long search is over.<br /><br />Now, this won't hold your hair in one place in wind like some products do, but it will allow you to take thick hair and blow dry it without it frizzing out.<br /><br />For me, I wet my hair with a spray bottle or apply just after a shower, do  a quick and moderate towel dry, apply about a quarter-sized blob of this paste, work it through my hair , brush it through and then hair dry with a tight round brush.  Then brush it out a few minutes later.  My hair wont stay like that all day long, but a simple brush through or even raking my hands through will usually fix things up quite nicely.<br /><br />And stickiness?  None. Absolutely ZERO stickiness.  Easy to wash the excess off your hands and the round container is easy to store or toss in a bag for travel.<br /><br />As long as this paste is on the market, I have no plans to use anything else.<br /><br />If you're after the spikey look or a product that holds your hair in the exact position all day long...this isn't for you.  And I would imagine that if you have thin, straight hair, this probably isn't for you either.  But for thick hair - you know the kind that resembles a football helmet in the morning?  Give this a shot.  Your search for the perfect product may be over. :)",3
5,"I've bought all kinds of combs but this same type of ACE comb lasts the longer, doesn't break hair, and won't kill my bank account.<br /><br />For the money; this is great and I'm a happy camper!<br /><br />Thank you.",3
5,"I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. It is a light fragrance, and one that my teenage granddaughter likes very much, as a matter of fact, her mom loves the scent also. It is usually on her Christmas or her birthday list of her favorite items.<br />Jackie",3
5,"While this may be an expensive candle, it is totally worth it if you want a candle that smells like a TRUE Christmas Tree. I burn this constantly through Christmas season and it's always on my Christmas list.",3
5,it's the best body lotion for me,3
5,Love this kit! It's very easy to use. Also it smells wonderful! Her instructions are well written. Very worth it,3
4,"This product gives good sun protection, but if you have oily skin and don't want shiny face, go with a mineral powder sunscreen instead.",3
5,"I recommend this company and product to anyone who has inflammation for any reason.  From what I've read, this is the natural version of steroids.",3
5,"I received the Aquage Hair Oil on Saturday, November 6.  The outside of the bubble protector package was soaked in oil (the hair oil was not in a protected packing), but only on the bottom side, which means that I did not initially see it.  I put it down on a futon in my studio and it soaked through to the fabric and mattress below.  There should have been extra protection as the oil is pumped up without a stopper.    This is totally unacceptable and reprehensible.  DO NOT USE THIS VENDOR!",3
5.0,I have been looking for an all in one trimmer that actually excels in performance using all the attachments and I found it with the Wahl.<br />Even the foil shaver gives a close and smooth shave.  I especially like the t-blade for trimming my beard and lining up my side burns.  This is the 1 product to buy for ALL ur shaving needs.,3
4,The product was received in the stiplated time and was as described. It works as expected and so I have no complaints.,3
5,"This product was advertised to fight fine lines, and I don't think I've ever tried a product that smoothed out my skin better than this.  There's been a marked difference in my skin in the fine lines from before I used it to now.  I also use it on my neck and have noted results there like I haven't seen from anything else.  I have tried MANY products over the years, and this is one I'll probably stick with.  It's an excellent serum, and I hope it's always available!",3
5,Smells great and lasts a long time. It is my new summer time scent and my boyfriend loves it on me. I love smelling like coconuts :),3
5,it cleans my nose without pains and makes me elegantly.,3
5,Love this gloss. Can't buy it at the stores anymore.,3
5,I am a huge fan of the BORBA waters and always have my refrigerator stocked with them.  I buy two cases a month and choose the water type depending upon the season and my skin condition that month.  I recently had a baby so I've been keeping the guanabana on hand for the wonderful firming effect it has on my skin.  I have a ritual of always drinking a water before working out.  The waters taste great and leave my skin soft and glowing.,3
5.0,"Cape fear kojic acid cream,suprise me l tried so many different creams,none of them worked they all lied about,cape fear worked for me in a week l have never been any happier keep up the good work .",3
4,Great product! I use it on my cuticles and it keeps the nice and moisturized and cuts down on hang nails! Love it!,3
4,"These are definitely for a bold look.  You kind of have to master applying these...because if you get it wrong...there's no way to fix it and you're out of a tattoo not having a second identical pair to use.  However, they can be used for many occasions and are definitely worth the price!",3
5,"Expensive, comparatively, but well worth it.<br />HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR VERY MANY YEARS.<br />EVERYONE SHOULD TRY IT.  HAVE A GO. YOU WILL REPEAT THE ORDER!!",3
5,"Best one I have purchased, and I have many.",3
4,"The reacher works fine for me. I tried other brands of reachers but they didn't last as long. This was the name brand of the reacher I received in the hospital, which still works, other than normal wear and tear. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that the reacher was bent at the tip when it arrived. It was shipped in a bag. My husband was able to straighten it out. Too much trouble to send it back.",3
4,This is a wonderful product and great for the skin without be greasy.  The smell is very nice as well!!!,3
5,"I bought this after using the travel model. It works perfectly. The Violight is based on sound scientific principles. I bought Violights for several of my adult children last year for Christmas. They love it, too. Now I no longer have to suffer from yeast infections in my mouth.",3
5,"This item works fabulous, appears just like it is in the picture and description . Its so convinent and makes my hair look the best its ever looked.",3
5.0,I love this Haruhi wig it fits perfectly thank you ^_^,3
5,"I have soft skin, and it is difficult to get a close shave.  I had a previous version of this foil shaver which I left at a hotel.  I bought this one, and it is unbelievable.  Save money, avoid the more expensive models, such as a tilting head. You can tilt your hand. As would be said on a popular investment program- BUY BUY BUY!!",3
5,"I was skeptical, especially when reading a good amount of reviews saying its great, but it really is. It's great for a nightly eye, and when you first out it on you feel it working right away. Then it says you can use on your forehead and other areas of the face that may be wrinkled or concerning, and it works outstandingly! I'm impresses and hope it doesn't just wear as I continue. So far been using it for a few days and its doing better than my last eyes cream. Only thing, I don't recommend using it in the mornings before makeup if you do wear makeup because it leaves a film where you applied it, so it may leave a weird spot under your eye when you put on foundation or concealer. I didn't like that. But if you wear it at home it's great.",3
5,"With a new baby and time for myself being limited, I was drawn to the idea of a fast cure time- and this did not disappoint !  ust used for the first time, and even if it lasts half the time it promises to, I am sold.  After final LED cure and swipe with pad, they were slightly tacky for a few minutes, but did not smudge - and 4 hours later, are still perfectly smooth and shiny.  I'm accustomed to doing manicures at home, and was very impressed with the quality of the polish and final results. Definitely professional looking {even when I accidentally added a layer of base over the color instead of the topcoat!}<br /><br />My only [minor] concern is replacing more of the alcohol pads (it comes with 10) -- I have no idea if my drug store carries them, but maybe I can just use alcohol...<br /><br />*Note, the \\""shell\\"" color is not opaque - more like a french manicure pink.",3
4,"Wonderful mascara, Stays on long, and is clump free! stays on all day! love this product! and will continue to use it! I got it free courtesy of influenster!",3
5,I got this from Angelic Whispers and i am surprised at the size and what I paid for it.I would highly recommend her store to anyone.,3
5,Have used this product many times.  It is the best strength to lighten my teeth and not hurt my gums.,3
5,"The Wahl 3 Hole Blade is working very well, I'm pleased!",3
5,This product is great came exactly like the picture and it gives you a CD on how to wax. Defiantly Recommend.!!,3
5,I just love Garnier Fructis style sleek and shine flat iron Perfector as my hair is always shiny and clean looking at all times and no more frizzy hair for me.This leaves my hair so conditioned and I plan to keep on using this great product. It's amazing how you can make frizzy natural curly hair so relaxed with out having to have it straightend  at hair salons.,3
5,"Best soap ever. I use it in the kitchen for hands and quick cutting board wash-ups. Here's my trick for saving water. Buy any kind of foaming soap in a pump dispenser. They're the ones designed to work with thin, watery soaps. Throw out the soap and rinse well. Refill with diluted Dr Bronner's 1:8, soap to water. Using the foamy dispenser keeps it from sliding off your hand before you can get to it.    Pump foamy soap on dry hands, lather, scrub, then turn on water to rinse, it only takes a few seconds to rinse away.    It's good for me, my senses, my pocketbook, and the planet. A quart will last forever.    Spread the word about the foaming pump dispenser!",3
5,Awesome product ... makes my skin so soft,3
5.0,love,3
5,just what the Dr. said to get,3
5,This brush cleans really well without drying out your face or irritating it. I have a great complexion due to this brush.,3
5,Love this shampoo and conditioner!!!! My hair is growing and more manageable. I recommend a color treated shampoo if you color. My color is dull after using for the last 3 mos.,3
5,I love it. It works beautifully.,3
5,"Fabulous mascara. I switched from the traditional pink and green Maybelline, and have no regrets. For the price, you can't beat this.  It makes my lashes look long and thick, without clumping or smudging.",3
4,"Easy to use. Quickly put hair up off your neck with just one, big pin. However, sometimes it digs into one's scalp, becoming painful. And the paint comes off, revealing the silvery metal underneath.",3
5,Blends well with hair that is light brunette and dark brunette.  These grip well throughout the day - no loss yet.,3
5,"While looking to try a new face cleanser, I came across this on Amazon. After reading some reviews I figured I would give it a shot. I absolutely LOVE this cleanser. My skin has never felt healthier. You only need 2 pumps for your entire face and neck. It foams/laters up quickly and leaves your skin feeling refreshed and soft.<br /><br />Additionally, I have noticed the overall tone/color of my face has evened out. I do have some redness on one cheek which has never really gotten better with any facial cleanser, moisturizer or toner. I firmly believe this one has helped soften that redness a great deal.",3
5,"very good razors very smooth and clean will use again ,a big step up the ladder from disposable razors so if you use disposable razors it time to step up the ladder and try schick quattro razors",3
5,"Started using Wildroot in the 50's.  It is the best hair product every made, in my opinion.  At age 83 my hair grows so fast using this product that I have to get a haircut more than once a month.  And like they said in the original ads &#34;A Little Dab will do Yah&#34;.",3
4,Good when you need a fast brightening of the eyes.,3
5.0,Works great. Quick to heat up and it takes less than 5 minutes to do my hair. Wonderful product.,3
5,This is a great product.  Goes on so light but hides all the flaws. I have switched make up now!,3
4,"I gave these a 4/5 because they are decent eye shadows. If you bake something the moisture has evaporated from the product thus, they will be dry when applied dry! It says you can apply these wet if you are looking for a deep foiled pigmented look. If you want just a bit of shimmer and color then sweep it on dry. You can even use your fingers to apply if you like. You do need decent brushes to pick up the color. Overall, the colors are beautiful although some are very similar. I like that about it because I can do a natural smokey eye for the day time and blend them very easily. For the price, it's about getting what you can out of it and you can achieve some sexy looks with this palette with some patience.",3
5,"I was looking for the long, wood stem cotton swabs for use in my electronic, wood, and metal shop. I have used them before at work and they are very useful for many purposes, both cleaning and applying various liquids, lubricants, adhesives, etc.  These are exactly what I wanted and expected. The wood stems are smooth and uniform as needed for mixing things like epoxy adhesives. They do not break as a cheap product might. The cotton tips are standard size and tightly wound so they stand up well to most uses. I do recommend them.",3
5,Works as intended and advertised,3

5.0,Works great! Leaves my hair soft and styled!,3
5.0,AMAZINGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!,3
5,Good!,3
5,"I was a little skeptical about purchasing the floral essences because there were not any reviews on amazon. I knew I would love the dry shampoo because of the amazing reviews on the other smells/types of dry shampoo batiste offers, but I 100% love this smell! I depend heavily on dry shampoo; I not only need one that does the job, but one that adds a little fresh smell to my hair. This dry shampoo did just that! I'm already addicted to it and will be ordering more! I wish they made the floral essences in the small bottles for when I travel :)",3
5,"I can't find a product that is both floride-free and is also sensitive for my teeth.  Sensodyne has always been my brand, but they do not have a Floride-Free product.",3
5,This product is great. It nourishes my dry hands and smells great. It does not leave a greasy or sticky feeling either. I would recommend this product to anyone with dry hands who hates using sticky greasy lotions.,3
5,this is by far one of the better colognes that i have used. i use only this brand for regular use.,3
4,They work great - but instructions for how to use them might have been helpful.  It took some playing around with them before I figured out exactly how all the pieces were supposed to fit together.,3
5,I purchased this product in hopes to wear shorts and bathing suits  without having to worry about how my legs look.  I go to the gym a few times a week and still have cellulite.  Well after a week of use myself and others noticed a reduction in the appearance of cellulite.  I have been wearing dresses with confidence and have started wearing shorts around the house.  I have just purchases a second set of lotions and will continue to use this little miracle in a bottle.,3
5.0,Beautiful lashes,3
5,It came perfectly and on time. :),3
4,"Pros: Good size, nice make up mirror, good magnification<br />Cons: Light is not so bright and the you need to be real close to the mirror to see anything properly with 10x magnification.  That is why I took out 1 star",3
5,Great service And price.,3
5,My kid loves the flavor!,3
4,"I really like this mascara and will probably buy again when this runs out. It makes my eyelashes pop and rarely clumps, however it is a little slow to dry so can get elsewhere on your face if you're not super careful",3
4,"Dovo excels at straight razor products.  True to their name, this paste is a winner!  Try this one for ease.",3
5,"Thanks to Infinite Growth for this wonderful product. My husband started using this product to recover his lost hair. We were really surprised with its results. Within few days of using this product, the results are clearly visible. At the same time, using this revolutionary hair growth product regains the lost confidence. Trying to purchase one more bottle.<br /><br />For those people with thin hair, it is definitely a worth trying product. Happy with it and thanks!",3
4,"It contains Menthol, Camphor and petroleum jelly.  It seems to be pretty effective but I know you can get a lung disease from sticking too much petroleum jelly in your nose.",3

4,"I'm a lady, and I use this just to shave my armpits, for the most part, and it is a great alternative to buying shaving cream in a can. I appreciate that it is cruelty free and environmentally friendly, as well as having (what I think is) a great smell. The lather could be a touch more lather-y, but it gets the job done.",3
5,By far the best SKIN79 cream out there. I have tried all versions and this one is very creamy and makes the skin dewy looking.,3
4,Very big bottle that lasts me for months.  Helped my hair feel nice and soft and strong too with it smelling good too.  I use it in conjuction with &#34;the daddy&#34; wax.,3
5,"I purchased this for my hubby, and it worked great.  No leaks, easy to pack, and makes him happy, enough said.",3
5.0,"Not only do these brushes look good, they also work great. Love how soft the bristles are.",3
5,"I am 70 years old and I love the feel of my skin after cleansing and using this product.  Nothing extravagant, it just feels good and fresh and soft.",3
5,"Excellent item, i will order again.  Does the job.",3
4,"I love the fact that this product contains some organic ingredients, is very effective, and all natural. Furthermore, for all its benefits, its price is so reasonable! Even though it makes my skin look whitish, i will still reorder it, because like someone else mentioned, just using a little of my mineral foundation over my face after the sunscreen takes care of the whitish look :)",3
5,I buy these whenever I see them on sale.  Usually a hair salon has a sale once or twice a year so you can get these bottles for 1/2 off Ive noticed... I wait for them.   But the product really works for my all natural hair.,3
5,"These are perfect for my essential oil blend sample. Also, great for travel! I'll be ordering again.",3
5,"A few years ago, I'd ramped up my anti-perspirant strength to the one just shy of prescription, and I still wasn't feeling confident. I had a chance lunch with a friend who had always had issues with underarm sweating, and told her about how frustrated I was with antiperspirant. She surprised me by saying that she'd given it up some time before & switched to a natural deodorant, and that it turned out her body had just been over-compensating. Since the switch, she'd been cool & dry.<br /><br />I went out immediately & bought the unscented variety of this Crystal Spray, and I couldn't believe it-- she was right! On bottle number 2 or 3, I switched to this lovely Chamomile & green tea scented version, and I've been using it happily for several years now. My whole family has converted since then, and we can't believe how nice it is to have given up the chemicals and the problem at the same time!",3
5,"I ordered this item fully expecting it to be a: too dark or b: would break me out.  I was pleasantly surprised when it was a perfect color and made my skin actually look better for once!  I've tried literally a dozen BB creams over the past year.  This product lives up to its claims.  The seller was quick and the side samples were a nice bonus as well.  I can't say this is for everyone.  I am VERY fair skinned and have highly sensitive skin, so that is where I'm coming from.  Curly haired, red head here who is happy ,for once.  Thanks.",3
5,Wonderful.,3
5,"Bought this as a replacement because it is easy to use and travels well. Works well on my short, coarse hair.",3
5,Everthing I expected,3
5.0,great,3
5,"Just got this cream. The first time I applied it, I noticed a little tightening and moisturizing. I have now been using for a few days. I am very pleasantly surprised and satisfied with this cream, the lines on my neck looks tighter after a few days use. And the skin on my face appears fuller. I am very pleased overall with the price and the results and highly recommend this cream. It's definitely worth a try! BUY IT!!",3
5.0,Works pretty darn well. Much more than I expected. Jergens has never disappointed me with their products.,3
5,To tell you the truth I haven't use these yet. I ordered them as back ups from my razors. I have inspected them and they look to be in excelent condition. I'm sure I'll need them in a couple more months. Then I'll order more backups.,3
5,"Bought this as a gift.. It is a casual fragrance , long lasting,  garden type fragrance ..<br />Recommend to all casual users..Not a nightime use unless you are in the South Pacific or Bermuda",3
5.0,Great product. I just love this scent.  Works Well for men or women...,3
4,I found this product to really refresh my skin. I like using it and and find it makes a difference. Easy application.  I just think the product is a bit over priced but most beauty products are really. I use it everyday. I also love exfolikate.,3
5,It is not a very large bag but it has so many uses and you don't need much for any of it. It is awesome!,3
5,"Great hair dryer, I've used it for months now, works like the day I rec'd it.",3
4,its comfortable to wear I guess expecting it to totally keep wrinkles away was a bit much for one product. It does however greatly reduce them. Im still using mine.,3
5,"I've always wanted an electric shaver, but didn't want to spend $150.00+ for one.  This one got good reviews and the price was right.  I've shaved with it 3 or 4 times in the last couple months and, though it doesn't shave as close as a blade, it gives me a good looking shave with no discomfort.  I have a light beard, I'm retire and don't need to shave more than once a week. Its perfect for when I'm traveling.  I like that its rechargeable and doesn't require the mess of foam. I can shave with my clothes on and not have rinse water running down my neck.  I now shave with a blade when I want that baby soft face, but this shaver is my go to shaver.  I'll give it a 5 star rating for its performance in the 2 months I've owned it. I'm gonna go shave right now (<;",3
5,"I am an Aesthetic Registered Nurse who works in a Medical Spa. We don't sell Weleda Skin Food at the<br />spa that I work at so I ordered it from Amazon. I love this amazing product. I am 56 years old with very<br />dry skin. This is truly the best nighttime skin cream I have every used. It is wonderful for the neck and<br />decollete area. It will help with the \\""texture\\"" of your neck if you are started to show aging there. I can't say enough<br />good things about this wonderful hydrating cream. Highly recommend that you buy!",3
5,"Great moisturizer stays for long but does not creat film, I am enjoying the natural ingredients.",3
5,"It's a handsome razor, with good weight. The shave isn't super aggressive, but close enough for me. Great lines and a good overall look.",3
5,This is the first polish ever that I will buy again.  I wanted something that gave some color but you could still see my moons.  This stuff is fab! With two coats you can still see the moons a bit but one coat was equally great.  It would look nice as the base coat for a French manicure. I'm super happy with this polish.,3
5.0,Absolute beautiful!!! I get nothing but compliments on this item. I just love it It is pretty and comfortable to wear!,3
5,"I do not have thin shapely toe nails but thick hard as rock ones.  I constantly found myself fighting with regular nail clippers trying to cut my toenails.  These are well made and cuts even my thick large toe nails without any problems.  They do a very clean and straight job.  If you have small, thin toenails, these may be overkill for you but if you are like me and have thick stubborn to cut toenails especially the big toe then these are the clippers that can do the job.",3
5,Moroccan Oil NEVER disappoints. I would recommend this to anyone who loves volume in their hair and prefers mousse over gel.,3
5,Love. This,3
5,This wig will be something new for next summer.  The style and highlights are awesome.  Can't wait for summer 2014.,3
5,I bought this for my sister. she cannot find this in any store and I also looked. she says it is the only thing that helps her skin and was so happy to find it. thank you amazon.,3
4,LOVE THE WIG IT REALLY LOOKS GOOD AND FEELS LIKE HUMAN HAIR<br />i DO WISH IT HAD COMBS IN SIDE TO HOLD IT DOWN,3
5.0,"This serum is clean, clear, has no odor, and I've reordered several times.  This is great for the price point and the way my skin looks.  I love it.",3
5,The only product my husband will use. Loves it!,3
4,I love rollerball fragrances.  It is so much easier to control the amount you put on!  And this is a wonderful scent. The only thing I would change is the writing on the bottle.  It is so faint that I have a hard time seeing which side is which fragrance! And I have 20/20 vision!  I had to mark it with a sharpie.,3
5,"Knowing that Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for a number of purposes (cell membrane formation, brain cell function, and the like), I'm committed to taking these Country Life Omega-3 fish body soft gels. Until about ten years ago I was taking flax oil, which is also very good. However, flax oil has a very short shelf life. Not so these capsules. Plus, being in capsule form they come in handy, and unlike a bottle of flax oil, they travel well. Although I'm in my sixties, I'm in great health. I attribute this in part to taking an Omega-3 supplement regularly.",3
5,"Great for my dry, maturing skin.  I can definitely see a difference.",3
5,"Never have dry, cracked cuticles again.....brush on day & night....& it smells good too!  Great gift item or stocking stuffer!",3
5,I've been using this serum for a little over a week now and have started to notice a slight difference around the eye area! I'm excited to continue using it.,3
5,All of my family uses and loves this. No irritants and contains ceramides which actually improve the skin barrier rather than just covering it. Will be a constant customer,3
5,"it got here (venezuela) today, it's safe and beautiful, perfect for a gift for valentines day.. just on time! thanks",3
4,"I use this bag organiser at work all the time. I use many different types of little tools and supplies on the job, and this bag makes transporting everything around much easier.",3
5,smells delightful- not a cheap childish odor! & really glad to be able to relace my broken original purchase (i dropped it) at affordable price!,3
5,"Una fragancia excelente que combina notas de vainilla. Me encantó este perfume, lo compre por los  buenos comentarios de otros compradores y no me equivoque al pedirlo. A un precio asequible y razonable obtienes una fragancia inolvidable y que perdura todo el día.",3
5,I have used this product for years and to this day have zero cavaties.  It is worth the price.  REALLY,3
5,"I have dry, brittle nails, cuticles that don't stop and am very rough on my hands. I'm also a huge beauty junkie - so I've tried most. I stumbled across this when I had done a secret shopper job for a store. I figured I didn't have anything to lose. Well, this stuff has my nails growing, and they're strong - I've even used it on my hair and skin when extreme conditions needed  me to try something different. It's silky, not greasy, absorbs super fast, and my skin and nails look great. It's pricey, and I go through tubes of it like toothpaste, but when the body shop has 1/2 off or $10/ for anything, I stock up. Highly recommend!",3
5,Great Products,3
4,"This stuff stinks. and its the gift that keeps on giving. somewehre between chemicals and sour wine. but, with consistent use i'd say the stuff works. no real notice of skin brightening but looks like a smoother shave to me. I'd say it was worth it, maybe the one without chromabright would smell different, at least it will save you some money. I dont regret the purchase :)",3
5,I've used this product in the past and for months forgot I had any.....I found the jar and started using it again....not too much left but used it and remembered how much it helped in the past....I am 76 years old and take aspirin....the slightest soft hit on my arms or hands and it is bruised....my arms are a mess - wish you could see them...This cream helps tremendously...I will not forget or run out of it again......It makes such a difference - I still bruise but CeraVue hellps them get lighter and they look so much better....I'm glad I'm old having this problem...Thank goodness it didn't start when I was younger it would have bothered me so much - but now I accept it as my aging process.,3
5,"i bought this hairdryer for my grandaughter for her birthday and tried it out before i gave it to her because she has thick hair and wanted to make sure this would do the trick.  i used it and loved it, then gave it my daughter in law to use , she loved it and wanted it for a christmas present.  so i bought her one and me one too !!!",3
5.0,Best straightened ever,3
5,"If you or any one you know is a fan of natural products, this little kit offers up a nice selection of products that anyone would love.  The two soaps are small, but will last through several baths and/or hand washings.  Best part is they DO NOT dry out your skin like most soaps (natural or not) do.  They leave skin nicely scented and moisturized.  The lotions are nothing short of amazing for dry skin.  Haven't used the massage oil yet, but it smells great.  The room mist is addicting.  It gets rid of any smell and leaves only a wonderful scent behind - nothing over powering or chemically.  It's safe for pets, too.  The bath salts beg for a deep tub, candles and your favorite novel.  The lip balm is yummy and works well.  There's even a little bottle of hand soap that's perfect for travel.<br /><br />I got my kit at a local Whole Foods and have used almost everything so far. It's far too easy to get hooked on this line of products from Indigo Wild.  For the price, this really is an amazing and thoughtful little gift.",3
5,"Order arrived on time :)  love this lotion. Also had a trial sized C.O Bigelow lavender and peppermint conditioner included, which I absolutely LOVE! thank you!",3
5.0,"i bought them for fun not to look real, and i must say that they are  very fun to play with haha",3
5,great for cinnamon toothpicks,3
5,Love this night cream!,3
5,"Batteries were hard to find so ordered through Amazon.  Delivererd quickly.  Installing them I realized that this is a job for experts or the highly mechanically inclined.  No instructions.  You have to take the Panasonic ES7008 completely apart to install and it's like a 3-D puzzle.  Took me 40 minutes and I had to reverse engineer everything to figure out how.  Succeeded, at least it works again, but I have no confidense that it'll survive shower use any longer.  Suggest try taking batteries out of your unit to get a sense of what's involved before ordering new ones.  Good luck.  Victor in San Jose",3
5.0,They do help me from grinding at night. I found for me the best fit is to put on top,3
5,Works better than the gels.  Doesn't get on my clothes.,3
5,"This polish is pretty much rad. It has sort of a reddish/orange base with holographic flakeys in it. In my opinion, this polish is meant to be used as a top coat. It goes well over most colors I've swatched it over. I will post a customer image of it over sinful colors Dazzle.<br /><br />The flakes seem to holo between green/orangey shades mostly and overall, they just add a brilliant sparkle to any mani.<br /><br />As always, KleanColors STINK, but I love the polishes so much that I put up with it.",3
5,"I'm very happy with the product, it's lightweight and makes for a nice smooth appearance.  I'm all about organics and I also like that it has a sunscreen in it as well.  My face stays moisturized all day as I have a tendency towards dry skin although this is not oily to me.",3
5,"I wanted a nail polish that sparkled on my nails, kind of a snow/glitter effect for the holidays. This nail polish is perfect! It goes on easily, doesn't need a second coat to make an impression. Some of glitter polishes you couldn't hardly see the sparkle without reapplying, but no problems here. As a mom of four very young ones, I am also glad it dries so quickly. Especially if it chips, I know just putting a second layer on a nail will dry in time for the next task.",3
5,great smell. natural. cruelty free,3
5.0,Olay Quench Daily Loition Plus Shimmer is my favorite lotion. It makes my skin feel satiny and I love the shimmer that it leaves. This is the only lotion that I use. It smells great and keeps the skin soft and smooth.,3
4.0,"I received the bottle yesterday and my first thought was \\""wow, 1.01 oz is a very very tiny quantity! I used it for the first time about 10 minutes ago, and I am writing the review because the laptop just happened to be on and nearby.<br />Immediate reaction: not bad. I have bad skin because I am generally bad at caring for it, and I like to blame it on the 2-yr old. I used a very small pea sized portion (just where some of the product was sticking to the cap). When I rubbed it in it felt very gel-like and I was about to feel some regret for not heeding the 1-star reviews, when the consistency started getting more watery. Then the globules began to form. I kept the circular motion for about 30 seconds from start to finish then used tissue to wipe it off then warm water and a soft washcloth to clean it off. I used it just around the area of my nose where my pores are the most visible. I have to say after the treatment the skin in that area feels very smooth compared to the cheeks and forehead. The pores and blackheads are still there, and I wasn't expecting miracles either, but when I used a Biore blackhead removal strip the pores cleaned up much better than usual (the proof being on the strip). My goal will be do use it twice a week and see where the 1.01 oz will take my skin. I will update in a couple of weeks.<br /><br />UPDATE (10/15/2012):<br />As I said before I am bad at caring for my skin and I have not used this product as regularly as I should, BUT everytime I do use it, I like the effects. The first few times I got a few bumps in my acne-prone areas. Now I am more careful to scrub more gently and I wash well with cool water. I read some of the reviews where it is said the product doesn't really peel, just balls up on itself. I think if you look in your sink you will notice that the \\""rubbings\\"" are brown (mine were!) especially if I use after a gap of a few days, which to me suggested that a lot of dirt was being removed. But don't just go by what is in thosecast offs. I would be surprised if your skin did not immediately feel very....well....clean, kind of stretched, just better complexion overall. I know this because my normally unobservant husband noticed :) I am definitely keeping this (and committing to more regular use, lets see how that goes).",3
4,"The Braun Vitality electric toothbrush is a reasonably priced item, but the replacement heads are a rip-off. These generic heads are a fraction of the cost and they work fine for me.",3
4,I don't like the smell very much… but works very well… I just think the smell is too strong and I can't wear perfume when I use this product.,3
5,"I am loving this. To start with, it was easy to start using and is attractive enough to leave out if you want to.<br /><br />We have a kit to suck out blackheads and I find this works wonders if used right before that! It really opens up your pores. I then go on to apply a mask etc and it ends up being as good as spending a lot of money on a facial. This steamer isn't cheap but if you think about it as part of a routine to replace facials at the spa then it's not so bad.<br /><br />It's so simple and easy to use and really does work. Your skin feels great afterwards. I also have allergies and I find this is a quick and easy way to get relief from them.",3
5,The E-series heads have been kind of hard to find in stores for a few years now. Sometimes it seems like the prices have been artificially marked up as well. I've tried using the generic brand heads and they are truly awful considering they're only slightly cheaper. This Amazon system with the easy package is great. No price gouge either.,3
5,"I have been using this blow dryer for about 2 months now and I love it.  It dries my hair very quickly and the attachments stay put and do not fall off.  I can understand why some of the other reviews say the cool button gets in the way.  When I first starting using the dryer, I accidentally hit the cool button but I have easily adjusted how I hold the dryer so this no longer happens.  That would be my only complaint with the dryer.  Other than that, I love it - my hair looks great, it takes me much less time to dry my hair, and it's not too heavy.  I am happy with my purchase.",3
5,I've used Bare Minerals Original foundation for years as it's the only foundation that doesn't clog my pores or cause me to break out.  I am very fair with blonde hair so Light (W15) works perfectly on my skin.  I don't bother with any other foundations anymore.,3
4,"Decent smell, but very sweet and strong smelling.  Strong vanilla smell, spray at your own risk, and only a LITTLE.",3
5,"Excellent product, great service-thanks! Great to relax to, even doing chores or while in the shower, end of the day or bedtime",3
5.0,The only natural deo that works for me! ITs best to apply 2x per day,3
5,"I really like Too Faced products, so I decided to try this travel bronzer.  It is a great color, goes on smoothly (the brush is very soft) and it's the perfect travel size.",3
5.0,Great for your skin,3
5,Worked great at the scene! Everyone loved it and it glowed forever!,3
4,This eyebrow tint was super easy and fast to use. I thought it would be be more work than it was. I didn't have any problems with it dyeing my skin or anything like that. My only hesitation in giving it 5 stars is that it seems a little ashy to me. I'd like it have a warmer tone to it. I have naturally blond eyebrows and they picked up the dye in the first 2 minutes like the recommendation. I just dyed them last night for the first time so it'll be interesting to see how long it lasts but I can't tell you how extatic I am to find an alternative to going to the salon. I typically get this service done at Benefit and with this i'm spending less than even the tips I'd typically add! I'll definitely continue using the fool proof product.,3
5,This was the most amazing thing I have ever used. I absolutely loved it I will buy it again so happy!,3
5,I keep buying these candles because they have such a great fragrance and the scent fills the entire room.  I love these!,3
5.0,Perfect for trimming. Vacuum doesn't get everything but the clean up is still much quicker.,3
5,"I have joint and back problems that have made me a big user of these reacher/grabber products. I own dozens and keep them scattered in and outside. I've used so many that I've become somewhat of an expert on them. This brand and size is BY FAR the best. It is the sturdiest and best made. Well designed and easy to use. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't currently carry them. Search the internet - they're around. Be sure to get the \\""PRO\\"" as there is a lesser version not quite as good.",3
5,I've been looking for this shade of purple in OPI for a long time! Very glad it finally became available. Will be using in the next two days.,3
5,I have used bare essentials for years and just started buying it through amazon. This seller is fantastic and the product is always as described. if you have a slight shine to your face by the end of the day i DEFINITELY recommend getting the mineral veil! it keeps my face shine free and fresh ALL day :),3
5,I like,3
5,This razor is of excellent quality and very easy to shave with.  There is no need for a longer handle.,3
5,It's the perfect neutral color.  Love it!,3
5,"Great product - wonderful scent, great moisturizing. I love it. I was given it as part of a Christmas present a year ago, but I had not been able to find it locally. I was really happy to find it here. The seller was great and will certainly buy it again.",3
5,GREAT PRICE,3
5,The only way I see this being way too white is if you apply too much. Every morning before applying my makeup I use this sunscreen. I love it because it doesn't break me out and it leaves my skin really smooth. The reason I picked this sunscreen is because it doesn't have a harmful ingredient called oxybenzone. Its pricier but worth it.,3
5,"I usually do not write reviews, but I had to for this one. I have used A LOT of products. I bought this because it was on sale and I figured why not try it. I was shocked at how well it cleaned/cleared my face! My face felts so clean and I seen a difference it the amount of blemishes I had. WAY TO GO, Avon. Thank you, for making such an awesome product!",3
5.0,"I am of mixed race of black, asian, and european, and have somewhat thick wavy hair that looks nice when wet, but usually poofs up when dry. I always blow dry my hair first before flat ironing it to make my hair sleek straight. A standard blow dryer along with using a round ceramic brush usually takes me 30-45 min to finish. But with this it literally takes me about 10 min (on high setting). Which is a huge time saver! I have never had my hair this straight by just using a blow dryer alone! Now I don't really have to flat iron my hair as much, unless I'm going out.<br /><br />Cons: low setting is pretty much useless if your hair is coarse, frizzy, or thick. you will not get the &#34;sleek straight&#34; results and takes way longer to dry. On the other hand, the high setting is extremely, annoyingly LOUD. At first I thought it sounded like it was gonna blow up. But I guess you get used to the noise over time.<br /><br />Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this to everyone with all hair types/textures!",3
5,"Great product. I cut my hair using the &#34;6 on the side, and #7 on top. It came out better than I thought. My advice: GO SLOWLY. DON'T RUSH. And watch the how to direction on the actual Wahl website. It;s their product, they know how to use it. Other online videos contradict each other so just go to the Wahl website directly.<br /><br />I made only one mistake. The ear tapering attachment will cut short unless you do it right way. I did it the wrong way so one ear looked a bit off to me but no one seemed to notice.",3
5,"I've used different sugar scrubs, but this has the best texture and the best scent I've found--does a wonderful job on my skin and leaves me feeling fresh. I bought up all the ones I could find at Target when I realized I wouldn't be able to get any more! The toasty vanilla is my favorite--wish they'd keep making them. For $6 (the price at Target for 16 oz.), you can't go wrong, but it was still the most superior scrub I've ever used.",3
5,"If you are looking for a gentle but effective shampoo with a wonderful natural fragrance that keeps your rebonded hair silky smooth and straight - get this!  The shampoo is gentle on the scalp. The plant based ingredients in this shampoo mean that my scalp is no longer itchy and irritatable.  Its been half a year since I rebonded my hair but this shampoo keeps my hair silky straight and swinging. What I appreciate most about this shampoo is, despite its super power in making my hair smooth, my hair doesnt feel weighed down. Two thumbs up for this range of shampoo (and conditioner)! Thanks Aveda",3
5,"I'm really enjoying this diffuser. It works well, i like the colour options. I've used it almost everyday since i bought it (couple weeks) with no problems. Turns off when the water runs out which is perfect. No need to worry about forgetting to turn it off. My room smells wonderful when i use it with my essential oils.",3
5,This is so important to me.  I have very sensitive skin.  Right now this is the only soap I can use on my face.  I have tried many since they stopped making Free and Clear bar soap.,3
5,Im oily person when i tried it helps control my oily skin. I dont use any brand beside this. Love it!,3
5,Fantastic conditioner!! I had a horrible bleaching gone wrong at a stylists. Decided to give this a go and all I can say is... what bleaching mishap?,3
5.0,Love The color,3
5,"I love this shampoo! I use the conditioner as well. I have blonde highlighted, kind of an ombre look.<br /><br />Overall, it makes my hair super shiny- both the blonde highlights and the brown roots. Makes the highlights stand out a bit more and absolutely  tones down any brassiness. I use the shampoo and conditioner for a few minutes each once a week. It does dry out my hair a bit, but I use Aussie 3 Minute Miracle after the conditioner, and my hair feels amazing afterward.<br /><br />Over all: adds tons of shine, brightens up and tone blonde, but it great for ombre looks!",3
5,Bought this for my daughter-in-law and it works well on her thick hair.,3
4,"This is and always has been a very high quality anti-dandruff shampoo. The 2.5% coal tar is the selling point here.     Good value for money.    I was very dissapointed with the shipping by Pricebully. They hadn't sealed the lids properly so I ended up with a package with multiple bottles that had spilt. So I lost some money on this purchase. Stupid Pricebully. Consequently, will not be buying this product from the Amazon website.",3
5,"I have been cutting my own hair for many years. It is naturally curly and it is nearly impossible to find a hairdresser who can cut curly hair correctly. (it needs to be cut dry not wet).  I had a favorite pair of barber shears that my husband broke while trying to open a package. So after stifling my frustration at him - he was very apologetic - I went to the local drug store to find a replacement. I got the Conair brand and they were just awful. So then I went to Amazon.com, saw the reviews for these Utopia Shears and ordered them.  They are amazing, especially considering the reasonable price.  Very sharp, well balanced, they don't pull my hair and the cut is precise. I like that they come in a case so I can easily keep them hidden in the back of a drawer.  All in all I am very pleased with these shears.",3
5,I've been coloring my own hair since I turned gray at age 35.  I've used Naturtint for 2 years.  LOVE it!  Colors the gray well; easy on the hair due to natural ingredients.  I've tried a few colors and this one is perfect for me.  Anyone who colors their own hair should try this product.,3
5,"When I look for make-up, I look for something that won't feel cakey and thick on my skin because I like my skin feeling as natural as possible. I used a brush and applied this product over a tinted moisturizer and it did an excellent job of hiding any discoloration or blemish on my face. This is my favorite pressed powder and I would highly recommend it!",3
4,"These work very well even from the first use.  The only downside is they made my lower teeth hurt like crazy afterwards on the first day, but not the top.  So now I am just sticking with whitening my top teeth...",3
5,"Great straightener! Does not snag my hair, and straightens my unruly thick mess in one press. Very good!",3
5,Great and not over bearing fragrance for the springtime. ..love the fact that it is light and refreshing..like candy..sweet and powdery,3
4,"This color went on smoothly, maybe a bit darker than anticipated but it did stay on longer than normal for me. Blended nicely.I will buy again.",3
5,"Since 2005, I have been using my Razorba to get rid of the pesky back hair. Unlike others, I don't like to put \\""shaving cream\\"" on the back because it's hard for me to \\""see\\"" the spots that have been shaved versus where I need to go over again.  So I just use diluted shampoo on the back. I also have my shower head on \\""jet power\\"" so that I can water rinse off the hair (on the razor) in between shavings. I also bought a \\""sink trapper\\"" deal for the drain so that the hair will be collected in that trapper so it won't collect inside the shower drain and pipe.",3
4,NuNutrients is an affordable way for us to see regrowth in my husband's hair. We have tried other products but this one seems to be the safest as well. We also like the easy way to apply by using a spray bottle....or if he chooses to spray it in his hands. We are seeing great results and love that it too is made here in the US!,3
5,"Love it!  I have always had very good looking skin even with in being &#34;oily skin.&#34;, even into my into my sixties!  Didn't think acne ! 40. For the past 2 years, my skin changed and I was shocked to realize it dulll & dry. This stuff made a my skin feel fab but firm. No love touching my face.  It's only been five days of use twice a day..  Good price too!",3
5.0,Have used this product before and love them!! My hair feels and looks so much better since using this product!,3
5,Had this straightner in the past.. and after it stopped working I always thought abiut rebuying it. . Have tried other brands and models but I hadnt been finding the same results from this Remington straightner. . I decided to purchase and I have to admit it works just like a remember..,3
5,perfect colour and it melt at body temperature. good moisturiaing for hair and skin,3
4,"I'm happy to see Amazon has lowered the price on this item. I bought it instead of pure coconut oil as a way to lower frizz and up shine. While it might take a few tries to get the technique down, the product is great for dry, damaged hair. I found that using it from just the ears down was best for me. It turned my ombre'd out ends into regular soft, silky hair again. I'll continue to use this product, however I wish it had fewer ingredients in it. i use it in combination with DevaCurl No Poo and One Condition. After using a hair dryer I did not need to straight iron my hair to tame frizz. I wish I knew more about \\""ethnic hair care\\"" products before now.",3
4.0,"Like all Axe shampoos, nice and thick, you just need a bit. Smells good.",3
5,Absolutely love this product! It was shipped very fast with no issues. The variety is wonderful. I can never get bored. The entire family uses this product. It is great for athletes to replace lost nutrients while training.Our teenage son has commented how good he feels after a long run and how he is sure it's because of the Spirutien.,3
4,"So far I'm satisfied with this product.  I bought it to replace the Hot Tools Deep Waver that suddenly stopped working after a handful of uses, which actually cost three times as much as this one did.  The main difference between the Hot Tool iron and this one is that this just has high/low settings, where the other one had temperature settings---not a big deal to me.  Love the pretty turquoise color too.",3
5,This makes my face look and feel amazing. I used to feel like washing my face was a chore but the tool helps so much and the effect that it has on my skin has made me not miss a day since I got it,3
4,"This product really fills in the lines and creases under your eyes, around mouth,  and on forehead.  Would definitely buy it again.",3
5,Excelente,3
5.0,primo was and has been my fav. perfume. it last long and not to strong. you have to try it if you have not.,3
5,"this thing is so cute I find my self using it more often than I would a regular toothbrush sanitizer...your toothbrush will smell a little funny after sanitation but it's a normal \\""hospital\\"" smell.  Took forever for me to find the battery slot but I eventually got it ;)",3
5,"A friend recommended this brand of hair ties, along with a raving review herself.<br /><br />They're soft, durable, do not leave indentation marks on your hair (or your wrist!), and do very little damage to your hair.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend them.",3
5,"I love using this product to exfoliate my skin, as it helps buff away dead skin cells and it tightens my skin/pores. It also does a great job with skin renewal – ergo, fine lines are eradicated with continuous use of this microdermabrasion cream! A little bit goes a long way with this cream and what I love about it too is the fact that you only need a minute or two to work the product on your skin! I used to be a big fan of microdermabrasion and diamond peel treatments but they tend to get very pricey. I am so grateful that I was given a chance to try this product out, as it gives me almost the same benefits as the aforementioned treatments.<br /><br />I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.",3
4,"It is a little messy, doesn't take the place of flossing but I like it.  The design is concise, easy to clean.",3
4.0,"Nice effects, although the sections that are lowlighted (painted to be darker) tend to bleed into the rest of my hair. Using pieces of foil and wrapping it around the painted sections of hair does help this from happening. All in all, I really like the effect it made on my blonde hair.",3
5,"I ordered Mavala for my daughter who has been sucking her thumb since birth. She is now five and we have tried many different methods to stop her habit. This stuff smells and looks like clear nail polish, but tastes so bad that it deters her from putting any of her fingers near her mouth. I painted my nail to test it and the taste is nasty, though it is not physically harmful. It has been hard for her, but after only 3 applications and two weeks she is thumb sucking free! It truly works!",3
5,"No you won't have a trimmer and you'll need to buy batteries but still you are getting a very good shave for very little money, less then replacing the foil / cutter or heads of most any brand shaver even after the cost of batteries.  So long as it lasts over 6 months this is a great value.  I see several people had issues with it not lasting that long but after using about 6 months now I'm very happy with this shaver.<br /><br />I prefer the larger sized Remington shavers as those shave a bit faster plus with the features you'd want for daily use but I'm not nuts about their current ones.  Really Remington and Wahl are the value leaders in shaving in my opinion with shavers that lack the Braun type of detail but give as good a shave.<br /><br />I have found spending over $60 on a shaver is just a waste of money, same on spending over $25 for replacement foil/cutters.  You get features but not a better shave.",3
5,"There's a pink to it but looks very neutral, I just love it. I was worried that it was part of the 2011 collection but the quality of the polish was excellent.",3
5,well,3
4.0,"I was not expecting such a bold scent, but I love it... And it lasts all day I would buy again..nll",3
5,"It was a little tricky to take off the old head, but the new one is a snap to attach.  After using it a few times I must say that my razor shaves like it's brand new now.  As a replacement it's a little pricey, but far less expensive than buying an entire new unit.  I'd definitely buy it again.",3
4.0,Smells good. Does not last very long.,3
5,"I like the product very much. The bulk order convenience is great too.  At first the butter seemed for 1 second  to be slightly grittier than another company's product I've used in the past, but as I applied this new one to my skin,  3 strokes of rubbing and anything that almost felt like grit was 100% non existent anymore. Product was great as promised.",3
4,I am just saying this right now so u know because I didn't until it got to my house. THIS IS NOT THE VIOLENT LIPS BRAND!!!!!,3
5,It is a great size for the price.  Exactly what I was looking for.  It is the best in minerals,3
5,5 minutes sunbathing and now I'm tanned. Awesome product and works great if as me you don't wanna spend the whole day sunbathing,3
5,Everything as expected.,3
5,"Picked this product after I heard some buzz about it in the salon, I purchased the shampoo, conditioner and the Smoothing Balm. It is hands down the best product I've every used.  It smells wonderful and the scent lasts, my hair is full of volume, smooth, but the best part is the shine! It's unbelievable. I've been a stylist for a long time and I've never felt so strongly about a product line. I've used other it's a ten products, and I've been a fan for some time, but this stuff is the best product they've come up with. My hair is long and thin, this product didn't weigh my hair down at all. Love it!",3
5,Love my Zebra Straightener! Heats up fast and does a fantastic job in a short time.<br />Great decision to buy.,3
4,mom loved it - great price for it - she begged for it and i got two since they were at such a great price,3
4,It's good and my teeth get whiter after I use it everyday. So I was thinking to get one more pack and keep using it!,3
5,I am very sensitive &#34;down there&#34; and this product really helps for a smooth shave. The protection mist feels so nice and helps to prevent rashes and itching on sensitive skin. It smells really nice too!,3
5,AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT FOR PROVIDING A SMOOTH AND CLOSE SHAVE. THIS PRODUCT WILL ALSO ALLOW YOUR ELECTRIC SHAVER TO OPERATE AT IT'S TOP PERFORMANCE.,3
5.0,This is a really great product!,3
5,This Remington is now not being made anymore. My husband has used this model for years. Actually his Doctor recommended it because of the allergies his has from shaving.  this worked for that. He will have difficulty finding a replacement.. Good product for many years.,3
5,"Love the smell of it. Love how smooth my hair feels after use. Best of all, I've stopped shedding!! I used to lose handful of hair daily. Well not anymore! Best shampoo & conditioner I ever used",3
5,Christmas gift for grandaughter.,3
5,"My brother-in-law is a dental hygienist and he gave my year old this tooth brush for his birthday and we love it.  It says it's for older kids, but it fits his mouth just fine.  He's now 18 months and we are still using it.  We don't always use the tongue brush but it's nice just in case we do.",3
5,I love these! It beats using toothpicks and other things to decorate. I have gotten at least 4 throughout the years both as personal use and as presents.,3
4,"I have reordered this product because it feels very good on the skin, and I have very sensitive skin. It also shows remarkable changes on wrinkles right after application. Unfortunately, the effect does not last very long. At this point it's too early to tell what the long-term effect of this product will be.",3
5,"This product is great. I just got it in the mail today and used it right away. I have used other products before to do my own bikini area and eyebrows. This product takes the hair right off and it is far less painful. I am very satisfied with all the products that were included with this purchase. The only negative is that the wax is really sticky, so watch out when you first open it. However, I would much rather use this kit than the other kit I had ( GiGi) . Even the after feel is great, it leaves your skin feeling smooth. I would recommend this kit to anyone, it is well worth the money. :)",3
5,"this deadsea soap bar with orange skin extract oils, is so good for the skin and super natural ,love the price and its healthy for the skin leaving it so soft and smelling",3
5,bought these for my mom who has a colostomy.  they work great when she takes them.  she doesn't like the taste of them though.,3
5,Purchased as a Father's Day gift....Dad loved it!  He has been looking for the bay rum that his barber used to use and this was it!,3
5,Excellent staying power  and lovely  natural shade that make one's nails look healthy.  It makes one's nails hard as well.,3
5,"wife loved it, i got her a two year supply. its a larger size then you can buy in the store apparently.",3
5,"I haven't had it long enough to really see results, but my skin likes it and looks fresher. Worth it.",3
5.0,"Great Product, my husband loved it.",3
4,"My fiance' and I have been searching for a good soap for his skin since he has psoriasis and eczema.   We've tried many and nothing helped, or it would just dry him up.  We bought this and now it's the only soap he will use.  It leaves his skin soft and it doesn't dry out.  I've started to use it too since we found out I have pupps, a pregnancy rash that came out of no where.  I suggest cutting the soap into smaller pieces and using it like that because it does run and melt in the water quickly if you're not careful.  And don't leave it on anything that you don't want stained.   Other than that this product is amazing.",3
5,"I like this product because I do not like anything heavy on my skin. This goes on, feels great, but it feels natural rather than like you have a lotion on.",3
5,"Great product, this comes with everything you will need to wax whatever you want. Heats up quick!! The only thing I was completely unsatisfied with is the when I went to open the wax it was all over the place I lost a good amount of wax that was stuck to the top which I had to throw out. Other than that all is well!!",3
5,Great product!,3
5,"I'm a man and I prefer the look of less body hair. I use this product in the shower about every 6 weeks. I've found by applying it to my wet skin, I can leave it on about 10 minutes without burning. It works great every time.<br /><br />When I occasionally burn myself, its my own damn fault (smile).",3
5,Does what you buy it for.,3
4,tastes good and even my kids (4 and 7) will use it. i have no idea if it's effective or not.,3
4,I like the shampoo fragrance and how it cleanses my hair. There seems to be no residue left in my hair. I will purchase this again.,3
5,"Although I think the item is bit overpriced (but still the best deal I found was from Le Edge on Amazon), I definitely would recommend the Le Edge Exfoliator for anyone who wants an exfoliator, rather than just a rubbing/soft scrub.  As noted by other reviewers, it looks and functions similarly to an ice scraper.  It's just a bit longer than a hand-held women's razor but with a broader handle and a safely dull-flat edge for exfoliation.  This very simple design proves to be extremely effective and efficient at scraping off excess skin, often in small swatches, in a relatively gentle manner.<br /><br />It definitely is far superior of an exfoliator compared to the typical body &#34;exfoliating&#34; items like loofahs and polyester mesh sponges, as such items still leave large patches of dry, flakey skin in my experience.  I even find this item better than the stiff natural brush (made of palm fibers) that I typically use.  This device is able to remove excess skin and debris more systematically and more quickly and perhaps, more gently.  I have dry, often itchy, scaley skin and use of this exfoliator improved my skin's feel and looked significantly and immediatedly.  My skin felt and appeared smoother and brighter (but not irritated) right after the first use.<br /><br />The only significant flaw I see with this device is that its reach is much too short.  A longer handle would allow for easier reach of the back for those of us who aren't contortionists.  Still, it's an incomparable exfoliator.",3
4,Great packaging; very good product--have never tried argan oil before but a little goes a long way. This product is pure,3
5,the only product i put on my face other than moisturizer. bought this batch for stocking stuffers for family and friends.,3
4,"I was having a flakey itchy scalp and I tried all sorts of dry scalp shampoo's and none of them worked. I ended up going to a dermatologist and he prescribed me some Ketoconazole 2% shampoo and it did the trick, problem is that its super expensive. So I looked around on amazon with Ketoconazole as my look up and came up with this shampoo, so I decided to give it a shot.. a lot cheaper. Worked like a champ, going to be ordering my 3rd bottle here soon.",3
4,"It takes a while for the BB cream to adjust to your skin tone, but after it does it leaves your face smooth and the tones even.  I did notice this BB in particular in comparison with other Skin79 BB creams leaves the skin a bit shinier, so for people with oily skin beware.  Also because this product is made in Korea, where fair skin is cherished.  So people with darker skin shades may end up with too much of a contrast between the color of their face and neck.",3
5,"I think this is very cool, i learned to put nail glue on and pour the beads over my nail and wait a little bit and secure it with a little more nail glue on top. I'd definitely order it again, and probably will soon, the processing/shipping time took less than the approximate delivery date :)",3
5,Love the Ed Hardy line!!,3
5,Beautiful purse and I love how comfortable the straps feel on my shoulders.  Lots of room for a big wallet and more.,3
5,"My dental hygienist gave me free samples of this product to try when I told her I wake up in the night with a dry mouth.  I tried mouthwashes that were supposed to help, but didn't.  This product is AWESOME and worth every penny.  It is amazing how it works.  The directions say to use one disk on each side of your mouth, but I find one at a time works fine.  Sometimes they last only a couple of hours (when I end up not going right to sleep) and most other times up to 3 or 4 hours.  When I wake up in the night I'll pop another one in to take over (alternating sides).  I end up using 2 - 3 disks per night.  No problem getting used to this at all.  If I still have some disk left when I get up in the morning it's easy to dislodge and throw away.  I can't seem to find this in the stores, but Amazon has the best deal, I'm sure, and that's where I stock up.",3
5,I have been giving myself manicures for years and this base coat is making my manicures last one and a half weeks without chipping. Wish I ordered more than one.,3
5,"Was even better than described!  Was extremely happy with the quality and overall product when received.  Offers the opportunity to trim it down if I'd prefer it a bit shorter since it is a solid, thicker leather product and works great.  Will buy this vendor product again as I need more.",3
5,"I first smelled Youth Dew years ago when a neighbor of mine was wearing it. I just had to know what it was. I have loved this scent ever since, and it is my go to winter perfume. This scent is timeless, elegant, and different from any other perfume made. There isn't another on the market that smells like this. One of a kind, distinctive, and wonderful.",3
5,"Great color, long lasting, goes on smooth, smells great!",3
5.0,This is a replacement for an Oral-B that is at least 10 years old.  This has some new features that I really like:  The quadrant system for brushing teeth and the shut off if pressing too hard.  We are very happy with this model.  I don't need a brush that is a &#34;Smart Toothbrush&#34;.  Does one really need this info on their cell phone???,3
4,"I usually use Lush Brand henna, but my color was out of stock, so I tried this brand. Because it's pre-mixed, it's far easier to use than Lush, but still messy. I was very happy with the color result as well. This brand has many more color choices than the Lush brand too.",3
5,The bonnet works as promised.  There is no need to hold up the blow dyer in order to receive the full air flow you need to dry your hair like other ones do.  It does get pretty hot under there but if you leave your blow dryer at a &#34;warm&#34; setting you should be fine utilizing it for 20-30 mins.<br />NOTE:  Make sure to have a basic blow dryer (nozzle that is round).  The bonnet will not fit into a wide end blow dyer.  Other than that the item is a great buy.,3
5.0,"Amazing peel pads. All in one face solution. I don't think now about any other beauty product for my face. Furthermore, I feel refreshed and much younger than ever before. It cleanses so perfectly, that face skin no longer require its extra care. I wish I could have found these antiaging resurfacing peel pads a lot earlier. Anyways, Better late than never.",3
5,Great product!  I love it when a product does exactly what it advertises.,3
5,"Love this wig. It can be styled with a curling iron, which is great for a synthetic wig. Had to add to the collection. Great work wig or for when you want to rock a short, blunt cut. Would purchase again!!!",3
5.0,My &#34;go to&#34; masque whenever my skin looks dull and feels clogged. It's pure nutrition for the skin and leaves it looking glowing and brighter after only one treatment,3
5,We have an ongoing problem with no see ums and this spray covers them and mosquitoes.  Very satisfied with product.,3
5,"I am very happy with this product. These headbands are flexible enough for my thicker hair, yet I believe that they would be comfortable even for those who's hair isn't as thick. I've been using the same band for a couple of weeks now, and it doesn't seem any weaker for all the use. So far, the silver color is staying on too. For me, these were a very good purchase at a very reasonable price. I would recommend these for my friends who need something other than a ponytail holder to control their hair. My hair is between short and long right now, and for me, they work perfectly.",3
5,I use this oil for my cramps and also for an anxious stomach. It's awesome and helps every time! Better than any other oil,3
5,"Oh, how wrong I was!  A girlfriend recommended this to me and since it wasn't too terribly expensive, I thought I would give it a try.  I'm sure I'd have even better results if I used a high quality nail polish underneath, but it still did a great job.<br />My nails feel like they've got a gel polish on them and this dries very quickly. It even seemed to even out a small imperfection in my nail polish application.<br />I have found my &#34;go to&#34; top coat from now and and I have already disposed of all other top coats in my house.  They are no longer necessary.",3
4,Good!,3
5,"This sunscreen blocks a lot of sunlight!  Although not recommended, it will last over 80 minutes in the water while surfing.  I have gone for over 4 hours without reapplying!  Long paddles and the good waves you miss when you are paddling makes this a wave saver!  Buying by the quart helps save some money on sunscreen and comes with a convenient pump.  Smells like sun protection.  There are no hints of perfume, fruits, or other scents.  Real down to business sunscreen.  Will leave white streaks on your skin after your skin dries, so you know it has been protecting you.<br /><br />Tips:<br />Don't leave the bottle in a warm/hot car.  Sunscreen will ooze through the spout because of the increase in internal pressure.  I cut a small pressure relief hole near the neck to relieve the pressure.<br /><br />This bottle is a bit cumbersome to take with you, reuse old sunscreen bottles by refilling with this sunscreen!<br /><br />Shake before using, sometimes it will separate.",3
5.0,Every orthodontist should sell this.  Great stuff!,3
5.0,It's perfect for my thick course hair!,3
5,i love it good smell and feel on hair and all,3
4,"Product arrived quickly and is working well so far.  Simple enough to use.  Can't speak to durability as I have had for only 3 weeks.  Slight inconvenience to have to fill up the reservoir and then replace mirror unit on wall and then remember to empty it after use, but it becomes second nature.  Overall a good solution and and a well executed product.",3
5.0,My family uses the Olay Ultra Moisture Body Wash and it works great with moisturizing and hydrating our bodies. Sometimes I don't even need to use lotion. My skin feels moisturized all day. I like it so much that I signed up for the subscribe and save program which mails me this body wash every month so that I am never without it. It is nice to get a product that does everything it says it's supposed to do.,3
4,The Hip Studio Secrets Professional Truth Eyeliner is great and goes on so smooth.  I chose the color brown because I felt the black would be too harsh for my complexion.  I love this pencil and would order it again!,3
5,Very smooth and easily applied. I have fair skin and platinim blond hair and this matches my natural lip color EXACTLY! I'm not even kidding! It makes lips look fuller and moist. Trust me this is a great bargain.,3
5.0,I use it along with many other products and I like it very much. I look 20 years younger than my age and I know this one helps.,3
5,"Great natural sunscreen.  Easy to apply and provides good sun protection.  Just remember to reapply, especially if swimming.  I would buy again.",3
4,"Good shave at a good price.  I know you can get better, closer shaves with other electric razors, but this does the job. Easy to clean and the price was reasonable.  I've had Norelco shavers for a long time and I'm very happy with them.",3
5,This cream is a miracle cream. Gives me a super clean and fresh look. It is not heavy at all. And you really need to use very little.  I don't ever wear any sort of foundation but this stuff is great because it does smooth my skin out and provides the sun protection. There is no mention of mattifying but it does control my oil too.,3
4,"Arrived within a week, the bottle was much bigger than I thought. Smell lasts for about 3-4 hours and that's it. I suggest this to someone who likes a light, clean smell rather than a heavy, in-your-face smell. Over all I'm satisfied, thank you to the seller! Found a sample in a magazine a year or two ago and finally decided to buy it :)",3
4,"Easy to use and very easy to clean. Does a good job. It comes in a small zip-up wallet which makes it handy for carrying around. However, it's a pity that the wallet does not have room for the lengthy charger cord which means two things to pack, rather than one.",3
4,"These are a great middle of the road blade.  They provide a good close smooth shave and are better than the Merkur blades that came with my razor.  While not in the same class as Feather blades, these Derbys' are a great blade and a good bargan that is hard to pass up.",3
5,I have had a lot of compliments on this. They look and feel like real hair . You can curl it and just clip it and go. The hair washes nice and drys easy. No once could tell it wasnt my real hair. I also used this for an updo for my hair and it worked out great. I will be getting more of these in a different color because in the summer I lighten my hair. But I am a fan of these.,3
4,Best lotion for dry skin,3
5,Good price,3
4,"I use this to wax my bike chain and it is perfect. I measured the temperature of the wax at 100C, which is perfect as it boils any water off the chain and the wax fills the slots. I can't imagine putting the wax on your skin at this temperature.",3
5,"I can't live without it.  I have dry skin and this is my daily moisturizer. It has a slight, vague, hint of color which seems to be on the very, very pale golden or super rich vanilla ice cream side. It adds a subtle bit of color but you have to look to notice it. I feel it adds a bit of healthy glow but not so overpowering as to look made-up.",3
5,have been using it on rocasea skin for 3 month now. decent moisturizer and no reaction from my very sensitive skin. recommend.,3
5,It is hard to find lovely hair combs these days.....this is just what I was hoping for...thank you...it is beautiful and easy on my hair.,3
5,"These arrived a couple of days before they were expected.  I was thrilled!  These lasted a week and a half after I applied 3 coats of topcoat on them.  I only took them off because by then everyone had noticed them and had complemented me on them.  They are very cute, dainty and feminine.",3
5,"So I've been using this product for over a week now. Prior to that I use regular Vaseline or any other hair product for my bald head. I needed a product that wouldn't clog my pours and make me feel sticky at the same time whenever I step out in the hot or cold weather. So I decided to try this product after doing some research and love it. it doesn't clog your pours, nor does it leave you greasy when applied to your skin. The product does have very mild smell that wears off in once the air hits it. I use this product for my face bald head and hands. Since using this product I've notice that my beard is softer and looks healthier (Rick Ross Look). I've also notice that my scalp is not dry and less dandruff. Its a really great product and i would suggest buying it and trying it for you self. I will be ordering a few more bottles of this product since my daughters have gotten their hands on it and see that is works for their hair too :) I case readers are wondering, I am an African american male in early 30's.",3
5,"I have used the Conair Compact curlers for more than a year and a half, about four or five times each month, for a change of pace/style.  It heats up in only a couple of minutes, great for busy days (which is everyday). Hot enough to set curls rapidly, these rollers are still cool enough to pick up and use.  The compact size is very convenient for storage and travel.  I find that there are plenty of blue rollers to give body and gentle curls to thick, shoulder-length hair.  I would absolutely purchase this Conair set again.",3
5,"I'm making a concerted effort to use more environmentally friendly products, reduce plastic use, and minimize exposure to chemicals.  Because of my fine hair and oily scalp, I was really nervous to go the \\""no-poo\\"" route.  In researching options, I came across this family of shampoo bars.  What a find!    At first, it's a little difficult to get used to.  Traditional shampoo creates a lot of suds, which makes you feel like you're really deep cleaning your hair.  Unfortunately, that's part of the problem, and likely why my hair is so oily to begin with.  I apply the bar directly to my hair along my part and around the hairline where I have the most oil.    The peppermint smell is very subtle, which I like.  This shampoo bar cleanses the hair gently, and without stripping the natural oils.  I've been using the bar since about Christmas, and I'm still in the adjustment phase where my hair feels slightly oily.  However, if I put my hair up it doesn't look oily at all; in fact it's shiny, and those annoying flyaways are almost non-existent!  I've also read that shampoo bars result in less hair loss (as they're more gentle), and I have definitely noticed this as well.  It's fantastic.  My hair is already shinier and thicker than it has ever been, and I can't wait to see how it looks after I fully adjust!    One note is that if you have hard water, as I do, the minerals will interfere with the performance of the soap (part of the reason why commercial shampoos were originally developed) and leave a dulling buildup on your hair.  This is easily remedied by using an apple cider vinegar rinse or using a shower head that filters the water, such as the Culligan model that is available quite inexpensively from Amazon.  I use 2 Tbsp of ACV in 8oz of water with a few drops of rose oil to cover up the strong vinegar smell.  Definitely not going back to conventional shampoo.    UPDATE - 1 Year Later:  I have been using J.R. Liggett's shampoo bars (this and the Coconut Argan) for nearly a year now.  I honestly can't believe the changes to my hair in that time.  As I previously mentioned, my hair was fine and oily before.  So much so that after shampooing in the morning, my hair would begin to look greasy by the end of the work day.  Now, I can wash my hair every other day without having that matted down oily look.  My hair is definitely thicker and I rarely have issues with frizzy hair or flyaways.  This is a wonderful product, but you have to make a commitment to stay away from commercial shampoos as much as possible.  I have only used regular shampoo during my hair cuts in the last year, and I notice that my hair becomes oilier again in the few days afterwards.  Overall, I am very happy that I made the transition.",3
5,"They are original equipment replacement brush heads...exactly like the ones that came with the Oral-B electric toothbrush. They work the same, look the same, feel the same. What else needs to be said about them?",3
5,"a good product, smell so well and taste good, i love eos and this is one of my favorites !",3
5.0,Sigma does it again! This brush is such excellent quality. It is perfect for applying a light setting powder underneath the eye. It sets it perfectly without having to worry about applying too much. It fits in that area around the eye just right. You can use it with such a delicate touch and it's unbelievably soft.,3
4,"So far I love the oil, I put it on my legs when their dry and my face, and it smells great.",3
5,I really like this stuff.,3
5,Nice Item as described,3
4,"excellent product, very useful,would buy and recommend Andis products to others. Shouldn't have to write more than you wish to write.",3
5,I think this is a very efficient and easily used beard trimmer. It is the best I have had over a period of 40 years of trimming,3
4,very good purchase,3
5,Works great,3
5,Felt like real hair silky and stayed manageable even after being rain on all day long.  Would highly recommend this product.,3
5,"I've only used this oil in my homemade deodorant up to this point, but I have to say I love it! It has a very nice smell - not at all overpowering. It also really does seem to inhibit odors. I'm looking forward to using it in other ways.",3
5,Very easy to use & recharge. My DDS said this was the one he used. Light weight and small enough for small hands.,3
5,THIS IS THE BESET CONDITIONER i HAVE EVER USED IN MY HAIR IN MY ENTIRE LIFE! IT FEELS SO SOFT & SMOOTH IN MY HAIR! ANYBODY WHO DOESN'T LOVE THIS IS CRAZY!!! BEST DECISION I'VE EVER MADE!!!,3
5,"This is the brand of brush I have used for a number of years, last a long time and are better quality then a lot of the other brands. Fast service from this supplier",3
5,Great tool! Though the tip could have been a bit smaller but it still does the job!! Comes in a nice package where I can store it in after use.,3
5,"Works so well on my long, thick, wavy hair! The fig is supposed to be best for that and it does work well, but this one has proven better in my case. Makes my hair so shiny and I can run my fingers right through it. I won't use anything else!",3
5,"It's very easy to learn with one of these. The sample blade that came with it didn't do much for me, but the razor itself is very durable and easy to use, providing a close shave and preventing cutting my skin.",3
5.0,Love the auto shut off when it runs our of water.,3
5,Fantastic soap.  Helped with my dry skin.  I'm still on the first bar.  A little goes a long way!,3
5,"This was a nice deep purple that actually looked like purple (as opposed to so dark that it looked black). It stayed on without chipping for over a week, too, which was nice.",3
5,I have very dry hair with split ends and my hair has a tendancy to be frizzy after perms.  This has worked very well where other products have not.  My hair is much less like straw and is shiny.,3
5,Does just what its suppose to. Easy to use.,3
5,"I use these for at home styling and they are just perfect! I'm not the kind of person who spends a lot of time on her hair, so there are a life saver.",3
5,Best fit for me. I tried the nose pillows and a mask that only covered the nose. Both did not work well - I'd wake up making weird sounds from my mouth (scary really). This not only fits my kind of chubby round face but make a pretty fair seal over a pretty thick beard without having to cinch it down tight. The adjustable forehead piece adds a little comfort too.,3
5,My husband's most favorite perfume. Love it.,3
5.0,"Okay, so I've been using this $30 deep conditioner that I buy at the salon for about 2 years now. It made my hair soft, but not as soft as I'd like (I have colored hair). I saw a review on youtube for Aussie's 3 minute miracle and since it was just $3.47 at my target I figured why not give it a try. You would not believe how soft my hair feels now- and I JUST used it ONCE! Incredible, I'm SO happy I tried this product! I seriously recommend this for anyone trying to achieve softer, smoother, hair.",3
5.0,Great product reasonabl price. My skin look better than ever .,3
5,Great Transactions. Would buy again.,3
5,This primer is great! This is the first and only primer I've ever had so I wasn't even aware that burning could occur so I'm glad I found this b/c I didn't experience any burning or lifting! It is a little strong smelling but that's okay if your looking for a good primer for acrylics I definately recommend this one!,3
5,don't klow how they like them yet--hoping they like them really well -  i will let you know what i find out,3
5,"This fragrance is not like the original from long ago, but still pleasant.  Great packaging and speedy delivery.",3
5,Most natural eyebrow product I have ever used. Am blonde and the color is perfect,3
5,"I have been searching wildly for this loofah, I used to order them from another site but unfortunately they closed(sad).  I was slightly skeptical upon ordering from you because most of the loofah's shown online end up being the hard, bleached yukky kind.  My order came very fast and there was anxiety upon opening the package but YIPPPEEEEEEE, MY LOOFAH!!! They are so big, I just cut to size and when the water hit it, VOILA my old friend was back in my life. Thank you, thank you , THANK YOU!!!",3
5,I have to say this is a great product.  It helps me keep my beard in tip top shape and when I decide to it is very quick and easy to buzz it off so I can focus on a closer shave with my razor.  I haven't used it for the hair but it's great for my needs and I highly recommend it.,3
4,"so far i am happy with this product but still testing it with the result, i am hoping it will work",3
5.0,"Packaging is identical to the original and it has a fantastically warm almost Noir smell, however, unless you spray yourself well over ten plus times don't expect anyone else to smell it on you, even those in relatively close proximity - it's odor is authentic for sure but it is so light that I question the overall authenticity. Worth a try in my opinion, but would I purchase this product again? No, albeit again it does smell good to me when I apply it.",3
5,nicely priced and has a great stink. my wife loves it. get compliments all the time nicely packaged over all what can say?,3
5,My nails are growing like crazy and as strong as acrylic.  LOVE IT,3
5,I think it is a lot of money for a toothbrush but the feeling after brushing/ cleaning is great. worth the investment,3
5,THANK YOU!,3
5,Love this spray! Combine with lotion for all day/night elegant scent!  Never get tired of it!,3
5,it's a lot cheaper than to keep buying gillette cartridges.,3
4,"I liked the variety pack and received a couple of different brands than posed here, but it gave me a chance to try out the razors.  I'm still trying them out to figure out which blades I like best.",3
5.0,Awesome product! I use this product every morning under my makeup. It is light weight and my skin feels incrediable after putting it on.  Would defintely recommend it for all skin types.,3
5,I use this without a mug.  I just rub the bar over my whiskers and shave. I get the closest shave AND there is no skin irritation.,3
5,"its amazing , lots of space for everything , im a freelance makeup artist and this is just what i need to carry all my things with me :) it is worth the price ..",3
5,"Fast shipping, great product and a bonus recipe book!",3
5,"I love it. It's a lot cheaper than anywhere else. A little bit goes a long way. It makes skin so soft. It came package in a regular glam glow box, I would recommend to anyone who is interested in buying this product.",3
5,Loves the color and how small it makes her kindle look. She also loves that it protects the kindle even though it is smaller.,3
5,I love the product it smells rich and fresh and it really works.,3
5,Love it! This has been a life saver for me.,3
5,SKIN TAGS BE GONE!!!<br /><br />also works quite well as a bug dope without the deet!,3
5,great,3
5,I have not found this item in retail stores for several years. I live in an area where retail stores are a premium. It is nice to find English Leather Deodorant Sticks still available on the web. I have looked for another deodorant that worked for me as well as English Leather but have not found any. If you are looking for a deodorant that eliminates odor and does not smell like perfume or cologne this is for you.  I did not know that this deo came in two flavors. It would be nice to list them in the product description. Even though this was a new scent for me it still works,3
4,"I ordered it all the way from the US because here in Europe i can't find it anymore<br />i found perfectly my color, so am sticking to it<br />light and natural, totally does the job!",3
5,"Just as I expected it to be at very little cost.  You would spend 4 to 5 times more in the big stores such as J.C. Penney, Sears, etc.",3
5,"My husband has horrible dandruff and we had not been able to find anything that worked, until this stuff. After he used it the first time you could not even tell he ever had a problem. His dandruff is related to being diabetic too.",3
5,AWESOME COMB I USE EVERYDAY.,3
5,"Love it! Use it everyday, all day!",3
5,Works like a charm; as good as the stick version (which is impossible to find).  Am VERY pleased.  Your delivery time was excellent also.,3
4,"I just got mine this week and I do like that between closer shaves I can keep my legs looking pretty good. It doesn't give a super close shave, but it doesn't do bad. I also love that I can shave dry without getting razor burn :)<br />I had an electric razor years ago that gave a nearly perfect shave, but I can't remember the brand and I thought this was worth a try. I am overall happy with my purchase as it wasn't super expensive and it gets the job done.",3
5,"I LOVE this color!<br />I was looking for a perfect deep &#34;red&#34; lipstick that wasn't too gaudy, but not too plain, this is perfect!<br /><br />What I love about this brand is the fact that I don't have to apply lipstick all day...it lasts all day long!  Doesn't dry my lips out either....",3
4,"This is a great palette of shades ranging from nuetrals,dark blues,and a shimmer black shade.<br />They contain mostly shimmer shadows but a few matte as well.It comes with a nice eyeshadow brush in the case.It is exspensive for a typical eyeshadow palette but the eyeshadows are quite long containing alot of proodcut that will last a long time.So perfect for traveling.I did rate it a 4/5 only because of the price for the customer.I got this as a gift and was suprised at how exspensive it was when I found it on Amazon. I have found better products.My personal favorite palette for $49.50 is the newest Sephora makeup case with a variety of eyeshadows,cream liners,pencil eyeliner,lipglosses,cream lipsticks blushes and bronzer.Making in great for home use and especially traveling.It is in a small black case.It is worth so much more than $49.50,I got this at Chrsitmas time so you may have to check if it is still available or only during the winter months.",3
5,Exactly what I was looking for. Put a few drops in my diffuser and immediately my room smelled great. Couldn't be happier with this product.,3
5,"I really like this wig, the hair is very full, its true to length, and for a lacefront you get a lot of parting space. I washed and flat iron this hair no problems, very little shedding and very soft. Follow me on instagram @famous_bryana for updates on the hair. Thankssss im happy with my order",3
5,It is very hard to find hair nets in this color at the drugstore. Thank god for amazon. These hairnets lasted for months of weekly ballet buns. I am about to order another pack!,3
5,"It's just fresh & clean but girly, too. I've been using this for a few years now for my everyday scent.",3
5,Love this stuff.  I use it every day.  My feet are in great shape.  Even my doctor noticed and asked what I do to keep them is such shape.,3
4,"I have just bought it last week and the smell is so unique. When I first spray the perfume, the smell of Jasmine just fill the whole room. Its a light floral perfume.",3
5,I have been using Exuviance Vespera Bionic for a year now and it is fantastic. Getting Exuviance Vespera Bionic at Amazon saves me a great deal and the service is greatI always receive my purchases on time or even earlier than expected.  All of the Exuviance products are great.,3
5.0,Smooth shave,3
5,"I love love love this set. It comes with everything you would need and so many different colors of eye shadows, lipsticks, concealers, and blushes. The price is very very low for such a great product! The box is also very convenient :)",3
5,"These are a ton better than your standard bath pouf.  Very exfoliating without being scratchy, plus you can hang them up to dry so they don't get moldy and gross. Never going back to poufs.",3
5.0,product just as described!,3
5,works great,3
5,"It's hard to find the larger versions of this oil, but I've succeeded with Amazon.  This is by far my favorite odor and brand, as Now creates a more distinct and lasting oil.  I call it my 'happy' oil as it creates such a wonderful ambiance with its smooth and pleasing scent.  Yes, I definitely recommend others buy this version as it was a very good price for the quantity received.",3
5,This primer gives a super flawless look to make up. Makeup sits and blends much better with this product. Will definitely be buying again!,3
5.0,"Lancome has cut back on their selection of the Magie Noire product line and I was delighted to find the soap on Amazon.  I am unwilling to pay \\""whatever\\"" for it but this was not an unreasonable price.  It is a great fragrance and not sweet like so many of the newer ones seem to be.",3
4.0,All the products from this line are great.  I use the humecto conditioner as a treatment.  Works great!,3
4,"This is an older cologne, but it smells good.  I rate this up there with Halston z14.  It's a classic scent and works well if you want to put a little on around the house or a pick-me-up anytime of the day.  It's not as expensive and you don't worry about using it all the time.  Try it for yourself or if your like me, come back to a great classic scent.",3
5,Very good moisturiIng cream,3
5,"I teach sailing and windsurfing during the summer, so my hair gets maximum exposure to wind and sun - even if I wear a hat.  I minimize the sun and wind damage by using Sunsorials Sun Repair Treatment.",3
5.0,I love this product! Will reorder again when I need another bottle. :),3
5,"My biggest \\""secret weapon\\"" in my make up collection is \\""Second Base\\"" eyeshadow from Too Faced Cosmetics.  <br /> <br />It takes only an extra 10 seconds to apply in the morning and keeps your shadow in place, creaseless and beautiful all day. <br /> <br />I'm a self confessed make up junkie and by far, this is THE best find I've made all year.  <br /> <br />Second Base will enrich the color of your existing shadow and may appear slightly darker than usual, so use a slightly lighter touch with applying your shadow. When using Second (or First) Base, a little goes a long way! <br /> <br />Highly recommended as my #1 \\""You've Gotta Try This!\\"" cosmetic find! <br /> <br />",3
5,I have tried all kinds of lotions for my dry skin especially in the winter. Nothing works better. Not greasy and does not compete with any fragrance I may be wearing. I lotion my feet at night and put on socks. My hard calloused feet are gone. My skin is so soft even elbows. Love this Gold Bond Healing lotion at this great price from Amazon.,3
5,"daughter wanted and uses it everyday, thanks!",3
5,"I have had this for over a year now and it works awesome. Battery life is great and recharges quickly. Gets super smooth, my friends actually noticed the difference.",3
5.0,"Both my husband and I love this stuff for our daughter's long hair.  We don't always agree on products that are more &#34;twiggy&#34; as we say (i.e. without all of the traditional chemicals).  But, because this stuff works well to get the tangles out, it gets a thumbs up from my husband.  And because it's &#34;twiggy&#34; in addition to getting tangles out, it gets a thumbs up from me.  A win-win!  Wonderful stuff!  Can't wait to try some of TotLogic's other products.<br /><br />I also was impressed that the company (actually, the founder!) contacted me after my purchase to be sure I was happy with it.  Wow!  Another thumbs up for caring about their customers! :)",3
5,"Great for sensitive, dry skin with breakouts. Most cleansers leave my skin feeling irritated, dry, or red, but this leaves it feeling soft and clean. Even though it doesn't totally clear all breakouts (still get the occasional one or two every week), the fact that I can use it 2x per day is a testament to how gentle it is. Comparable to more expensive 'sensitive' formulas I've used in the past.",3
5,"I got this product before it said I would, I'm so happy with the results. Thank you so much for my new gun and ink!",3
5,"Smells exactly like a blooming lilac bush. Not too overwhelming yet has an amazing staying power. It lingers for hours. Unlike many other perfume oils I tried before, this one doesn't change its base notes when applied directly to the skin.",3
4,"There are a lot of really amazing reviews about this product but from my personal experience and expectations I didn't find it as amazing as other customers. I'm not sure if it is just this specific batch, but it was not really much of a gel consistency, it was pretty runny. It did peel off some dead skin cells. I have a few skin conditions and it is very sensitive and it was not irritated at all by this product.<br /><br />I purchased this product as a replacement for a similar Korean product. I gave this one 4 stars because I thought the Korean product was more effective.",3
5,"Wife loves it, couldn't be happier, Great item, She thanks you and so do I.",3
5,"The nail polish is amazing. Very fond of this product. I love the colors, the perfect collection for color schemes and designs. The only issue is also necessary for one of the more positive aspects of the product. The brush is incredibly tiny, leaving it to be difficult to paint a nail. With that said though, its extremely east to do nail art with this, and easy to handle. The lip of the bottle is small enough to were if it tips over open it takes a while for product to leak out. For the price I would say is the an incredible product and possibly the best on the market in comparison with similar products and pricing. Very pleased. Thanks to the company and seller :)",3
5,Good for edges.  No flaking and white build up.  Definitely would recommend using for all purposes.  Best edge control I ave ran across in a long time.,3
5,FAVORITE LOTION EVER!!!!!!!!,3
5,"This brush is amazing. I couldn't find it on the Glo website, so I bought it on amazon. I have severe adult acne and wash my brushes daily. You can usually tell a brush's quality as you are washing them. This one is holding up well. I love the small tip to apply green concealer ONLY on the pimples then I use the other end for my glo foundation. Overall, this is a great brush.",3
5,this really works well with  &#34;wen&#34;  conditioner --  love the smell of the lemon  &  how well it cleans  - squeaky -  esp after  long spells of not washing with &#34;cleansing product&#34;  -  ty  for selling online- will return to buy more  - love it,3
5.0,"I have tried these, the Feather ProGuard, and the Kai Captain Mild, in both my Mongoose and my Feather Artist Club. For those who don't know, Kai is Feather's rival, it makes products that are nearly identical to Feather's, and the Mongoose is a safety razor that takes these kinds of blades. The Artist Club is essentially a straight razor that takes these blades.<br /><br />The Feather Professional are my favorites, with the ProGuard right behind. The Pros are very smooth, very sharp, and very durable. The same can be said for the ProGuard, though the feel is different because of the protective wire.<br /><br />If you are new to these blades be careful. No reason to be afraid but plenty of reason to be alert to maintaining good technique. And you might, if you're a newbie, want to start with the ProGuards. As far as i'm concerned, these are the best blades of the kind that you can buy. And, for some reason, far smoother than the Feather Double Edge blades!",3
4,would love a dropper option,3
5.0,"Love this, addes length to my lashes without clumping...",3
5,"This was a gift for my husband. He was so happy to get it. He had been looking for it for a long time, and very dissapointed that it was out of the market. But when he got it, he was really happy.",3
5,"I didn't know my face really soft before I change that new head.<br />I have been using HQ7825 for seven years.<br />I was hesitate to buy head because Its price expensive then other model.<br /><br />Now, I am satisfied with new head. I recommend change old head if you are using a philishave for a long time without replacement head.",3

5,My favorite oil blend. Citrus/Tea tree dominant smells.  Refreshing & bright scent.  Used daily in my classroom.  Didn't get sick/need to miss days of work once I started using.,3

5,I received the right product on time. What more can I say! It was a good experience overall end of story.,3
5,"My husband has been asking me for a back scratcher for a couple of months and I finally got him one. He absolutely loves it.  Of course, it isn't quite as good as a person, but he can get all the spots he couldn't on his own.  He also likes the telescope feature because it's nice an compact.",3
5,"Best comb ever. Comfy, doesn't pull at thick hair. And just feels nice in the hand. i carry it with me always. bought another to keep at work.",3
4,Love the scent,3
5,"I have used this product for almost two months now and I really like it.  I am trusting EWG rating when it says it is a safe sunscreen to use.  I've used it on all three of my kids during outside play and swimming.  When applied as directed and reapplied as directed, I have not have any of my children burn.",3
5.0,"All the other 5 star reviewers are right:  this really is the perfect mascara.<br /><br />No smudging, no clumping, easy to apply, easy to remove (I use Almay water-based eye makeup remover), very little of it makes your lashes long and lush, so it goes a long way, and the ONLY mascara my super-sensitive eyes can wear.<br /><br />Over the counter, store-bought mascaras all make my eyes watery and irritated, and they have chemical odors as soon as I pull the wand out.  That is not the case with this wonderful mascara.  It is pricey, but it is well worth the money, trust me (and I'm cheap).  I will buy only this mascara from now on.",3
5,"I wanted something that was easy to use, quiet and affordable.<br />This diffuser is all three.  We love using it at night in our room with different relaxing and therapeutic oils.",3
5,I love these brushes...I have very long thick hair and this works great.  I like the brush so much I bought this set for my daughter-in-law and granddaughter (20 months old).,3
5,"Developed dry eye after cataract surgery and after reading great reviews about it, decided to try this product. Wow, am I ever glad I did! Instant relief--so much more effective than any other drops I had tried before. Can't say enough positive things.",3
4,This belt is very comfortable and does the trick. I don't even use the straps and it keeps my hernia in place for my workouts!,3
5,This has a nice metal look to it. In my opinion it has a tiny hint of gold in it but it's meant to be a silver metallic shimmer.<br />I love the mix of the metallic and shimmer.<br />I love the brush in the product! I haven't used the product only painted it on a color wheel so I don't know how long it lasts or whether is chips or not. If it's long lasting and stays at the price I paid I would purchase it again.,3
5,I just got this yesterday. At first when I put it on it seemed like it kinda creased my in fine lines under my eyes but I guess it was because I didn't rub it in properly. But it's very good I love it!,3
5.0,"My wife purchased these for our trip to Aruba.  After she put some on herself and our daughters, other girls and women at the resort starting asking about them.  By the time we left my wife had given out a couple of sheets to another family.  It became a domino affect, so by the end of the trip many of the women and girls were wearing them.  There was this casual connection among them that made the trip more enjoyable.",3
5.0,"Ordered for my almost 10 year old who has KP. It's on his arms, upper thighs, and on his cheeks and we've tried so many products. He's used this 4 times and there is significant improvement! He's so excited, as am I, that we've finally found something that actually helps and is affordable.",3
5,cheap and easy to use.,3
4,The wig is pretty nice.  it would be better if the hair towards the front where you part was smoother and not tightly curled looking.,3
5,I have been using Ramy products for years.  This foundation is very sheer yet provides lots of coverage while looking very natural.  You won't be disappointed.,3

5,I always order from &#34;Cool2day&#34;. I wear their wigs on a everyday basis. All of their wigs are a great quality. Because they are so cheap if I ruin one I just order a new one.,3
5,"Bought this as a gift for my wife a few days ago as she had mentioned wanting a new one and let me tell you, the reviews checked out, she LOVES IT!5 stars!!",3
4.0,"This is some seriously weird stuff.  Not necessarily bad, just different.  Makes me feel like a hippie.<br /><br />I am a victim of the 'just for men' (JFM) curse of horrible itching and a rash that was getting worse as I used it more regularly.  After doing some Googling, I realized others were having much worse reactions than I had, and there was potential it could get worse for me if I continued using it.<br /><br />So after hours of searching, I found and tried this stuff. Not even remotely the same experience.  There is some earthy smell going on, but not that unpleasant, just very distinctive.  The color wasn't as tunable as the tons of shades offered by JFM.  In the end, I had no reaction or irritation to it.  The color did change somewhat overnight (got darker).  It was lighter brown that I had hoped, but it was better than my natural Grey color.  It lasts as long as the JFM in my experience.  The match with the surrounding dark hair was good enough that it serves the purpose and I look younger.<br /><br />The actual dying takes a lot longer.  You have to not move around much during the hour you have it on or you end up dropping little bits of Henna dye goop.<br /><br />I carry it around in a baggie on trips which has worked well.  You can get a BUNCH more use out of a package than the JFM which I could never seem to get more than 2 or 3 uses out of.<br /><br />Somewhat inconvenient... yes, but I refuse to use the JFM battery acid ever again, and there aren't a lot of options.  Take your time and this product works nicely.",3
5,I love this product. it work.,3

5,"By far my favorite sugar waxing kit. I've tried a few other sugar wax brands (some organic/no heat ones were painful, and/or hardly pulled any hairs out), but always end up returning to BodyHonee. The wax is painless to apply,efficient, and extremely easy to wash off if there's a little wax residue. Also pleased with how much sugar wax comes in the package, last's a long time (other brands I've tried left me shocked with how little wax you get for the price, total rip-off's). I always recommend this brand to friends and family. The shipping was quite fast as well, took only 4 days from my order date which made me happy. :)",3
5,Cleans good.,3
5,"This product works like a charm. The first couple of times, my lips turned purple. However the more I used it, that stopped happening. When it arrives, it comes in a cute little drawstring bag with a handwritten note from the maker. AND mine actually came with a complimentary medium sized fullip enhancer too. SO COOL!",3
5,"This lamp is great for my Gelish Nail Polish and the setting are good, 30s, 60s, 90s ... versatile.  Great product for Gelish!!!",3
4,Worked well and we are happy using it.<br />Also reached by the promised date.<br />Will recommend this product to anybody.,3
5,"From my girlfriend's mouth:<br /><br />\\""This is the first hair straightener I have personally owned. It is very easy to use and comes with detailed instructions. I have only used it on damp hair so far (not full on wet out of the shower) and it dried and straightened it beautifully. I was weary of owning a straightener before, but this product is high quality and true to its promises. I highly recommend it.\\""",3

5,This made my hair very soft. It feels a lot healthier now! I would recommend this to anyone!,3
4.0,"I purchased this nail polish at a local drug store for $9.99 so much cheaper than here on Amazon especially when shipping is added. I personally consider a $9.99 nail polish to be on the pricer side of nail polishes, but that is just me.<br /><br />Pros: I really enjoyed the silver color which essentially turns into black \\""waves\\"" once the magnet is used. It also has a slight glitter effect but isn't over powering glitter as some polishes have. Very easy to use when you follow the directions (second coat must be very thick, I found the thicker the coat the better the magnet effect turned out). The magnet has a raised ridge to be placed near your cuticle so the magnet doesn't touch the actual nail color. The color is very opaque and covers nicely. A nice easy effect that gives the nails a nice nail art like result. Dries SUPER fast which I was really surprised by considering how thick your second coat is, I waited longer but could have applied my top coat within probably 10 minutes which is extremely fast for majority of nail polishes.<br /><br />Cons:  I wish the the magnet was curved to contor the nail better as I found that while the middle of the nails had a really nice \\""wave\\"" affect the sides of the nails remained mostly just the silver color. I attempted to \\""roll\\"" the magnet to the sides of my nails but I didn't see a big change by doing this. With the raised cuticle part of the magnet it is fairly easy to not actually touch the magnet to the nail but you do have to be careful as you want the magnet as close to your nail color as possible. It is recommended that you hold the magnet over your nail for 10 seconds but I found waiting 20-30 seconds gave a more intense affect. The actual bottle of nail polish is fairly small for a $9.99 or more nail polish and I expect I will go through it fairly quickly due to the thick second coat. Once you purchase the product you will see that the actual top of the nail polish is the magnet which once you remove it you will findthat the brush handle (probably around the size of my thumb) is fairly small as is the brush, but I wasn't too bothered by this but some might be.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed this product, it was easily to use, I liked the effect, it dried quickly, and was just overall a fun new item for nails. If you are into mettalic looking nail polishes would highly recommend.",3
5.0,"I love it, works great!... My nail tech used this, so I bought one for me after she moved away...",3
4,"I bought this from a local hair store for my daughter who has mixed hair.  It made her hair greasy.  It wasn't cheap, so I didn't want to waste it.  I put it on my relaxed hair.  Did wonders for me! Later I put it on my edges.  It completely moisturized them and looked like I just relaxed my hair.  I will DEFINITELY buy more when this is gone.",3
5,"I love that it doesn't have the chemical sunscreen which is terrible for you. it has a slight white sheen on you, but that way you know where it is applied. I've tried this same brand with a pump from a bottle and this squeeze kind. I prefer this squeeze kind because the pump became clogged and leaked.",3
5,"Ok let's start by saying I use to work at Gottschalk as a cosmetologist  in the Makeup Department and Elizthbeth Arden is all I wore in eyeshadows and foundation in fact recommended Elizthbeth Arden to customers over Lancome only because the Eyeshadows had a higher Pigment in it than Lancome which made the shadow bold and beautiful on your eyes. But when Gottschalk Department store went out of business Elizthbeth Arden took most of her production makeup line off the Internet and Department stores.Which was disappointing because her foundations were flaw less beautiful and glowing natural look went on smooth. So when I saw this Palette I had to have it  beautiful smokey grey colors with a medium Bronzer. Absolutey beautiful worth the Money . Trust me when I say you would not be dissatisfied in any way, This seller was fast on time with shipping and would order any day from this seller again. Also would recommend any day to friends and family. Thank You Kristen.",3
5,Great Product and consistent quality. I've used this product for years and purchased it in stores before.  Now that I've found it on Amazon - it's a great price.,3
5,"This is a wonderful product....Received my first jar as a gift from my sister.  I thought I would try it on my face.  At 68, I am  in the market for products that help lines, especially since I lost alot of weight.  This product is amazing. I lavish it on my face after showering and before bedtime...let it soak in.  I am amazed that my skin looks so much healthier and with less lines on my face.  I use it daily.  I. also, put it on my legs because they do get dry especially in the winter months.  My legs are not as dry anymore either.  This product is not at all expensive and you get a nice quantity for the amount that you pay...so, I do not scimp when I put it on.  I will defintely be buying more of this when my supply runs low.",3
5.0,It came as it was presented on ad. Will be using it for 15th for my granddaughter.I am happy with this product.,3
5,"Smells pretty good, I wish there was more information on the bottle though, I like to read while im in the shower",3
5,I have used this wax with gigi wax warmer on my under arm without wax stripp. It leaves few tiny hair . I would buy wax strip and try it next time. I like Gigi wax heater. It provides perfect warm and it didn't burn my skin . I am glad to purchased both the items( Gigi wax and Gigi wax heater).,3
5,This is my favorite moisturizer. It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin and the SPF built in is better than using a separate heavier sunblock.,3
4,This product smells amazing and works very well! I love it! Only 4 stars because the bottle is tiny.,3
5,"My last beard/mustache trimmer, the [[ASIN:B0009OMU0A Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer]], turned out to be a waste of money.  Not long after buying it, the non-replaceable battery was no longer able to hold its charge for more than a day or so.  So far, though, I have been impressed with this Panasonic trimmer.  After a few weeks, using it once or twice a week, the initial charge is still going strong.  In that regard, the Panasonic easily beats the Remington.<br /><br />More important to me, though, is the level of precision this Panasonic Trimmer offers.  The dial lets me select any length from one to ten millimeters, in steps of 0.5 millimeters.  For the most part, all the extra features (comb attachments, easy to clean with water, etc.) are irrelevant to me, and I've yet to really test them out.  But for a precise and reliable trim, with a battery that won't die unexpectedly, this has been a great trimmer.<br /><br />One side note...one reviewer noted that the trimmer needs to be oiled each time it's used.  It's true.  That's exactly what the instructions suggest.  If you dig around in the instructions for most trimmers, they will say the same thing.  Yes: frequent oiling is important for extending the life of most trimmers.  Having said that, it's really up to you.  Oil it regularly, and it will probably last longer.  However, you could probably get away with less frequent oiling without causing any problems.  Personally, I've been oiling it after every 3 or 4 uses.  I would probably oil more frequently if I washed it with water each time.<br /><br />All in all, this has been the best trimmer I have had in a long time.",3
5,Great addition on top of another pillow to avoid getting wrinkles around your eyes when you sleep on your side.  I have used this pillow for months and have had comments that I look well rested. I think that this is because the area around my eyes looks better.,3
5,"So far have had limited experience with it, only the towelette. However, it has a lovely, light fragrance and my past experience with Avon's repellents has been tops.",3
5,"I visited my daughter and notice her skin felt so soft. She has psoriasis and said she started using Olive Oil Soap and she would give me some. Well I returned to NYC and forgot the soap. I looked up Olive Oil Soap and noticed that I could order it through Amazon. I ordered two packages of six. I love it more than Dove. I am an older woman so my health, teeth and skin are very important to me. My skin feels softer and there are no perfumes in the soap. The only set back was it was at least a weeks wait for delivery but for me it was worth the wait.",3
5.0,This worked well!,3
5,I LOVE THIS.. AND WHEN IT IS GONE... WILL ORDER MORE.. ESPECIALLY THE EYE LINER!! SUPER GOOD STUFF,3
4,"The company did send this out right away and out of the four companies I ordered from on the same day, this arrived first, well boxed and with a coupon to their website. This made me very happy and I would order from them again for sure!   I gave this a four instead of five because it isn't my favorite color.  I thought it would look more natural than it did.  I ordered this color, UV lamp, top and base coat and I hope it lasts the two weeks everyone says it will.  I am in my first week so I hope it lasts, so far so good!  I enjoy doing my own nails. It is expensive to get started but it will pay for itself after a few months.  The shellac does not go on exactly like a regular polish and while I am really good at painting my own nails this will take a couple of times for me to get used to it.  First time I did it and they look really good.  My only advice would be to be sure to keep the polish away from your cuticles and clean them off well before you put them under the lamp.",3
4,"I am an African American woman with tightly naturally curly hair. This conditioner was nice but not the best that I have tried. It was very conditioning and left my hair soft, but it did not provide a lot of slip to detangling my curly hair which is necessary for me. The smell is nice and not very overwhelming. I left it in my hair a few hours before rinsing it out. I will try it again to see if it is able to lock in my curl pattern and update my review then. I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review,",3
4,"Love this stuff. They stopped carrying it at my local general store. I like to flat iron my hair. This helps to sleek down the little stray fly-aways without weighing it down and making it look greasy or full of product. The smell is pretty neutral also. When I couldn't find this at the store, I tried several other similar items but the smell from those other products gave me a headache.",3
4,I like this perfume but not crazy about it,3
5,"Croc clips are great and these are great ones. Nice finish, clasp, and weight.  Dependable and will last a long time.  Price is good for the quality.  Will order again.",3

5,"This kit came with a product for all sorts of uses.  I bought it for my wife because she has really dry and cracked hands and it has helped immensely.  I have even found myself using some of the products.  I am a diabetic and have trouble with dry and cracked feet.  This kit comes with a coconut foot lotion that has worked wonders to help repair my feet when nothing else worked.  Its a little greasy at first, but if you let it dry for a few minutes it stick.  This is an awesome product, well worth the money!",3

5,"I use the the Leave-In Protectant twice a week after I wash with the K-PAK reconstruct shampoo and condition with the K-Pak Deep Penetrating Reconstructor/K-Pak Intense Rehydrator combo.  I have relaxed hair and this leave-in makes my hair smooth and gives it body and thickness without weighing it down. It makes my hair easy to comb through without breakage (no hair in the comb, on my shoulders, or on the floor).  I use this product to air-dry  and my hair comes out frizz-free and smooth with plenty of body.  I've used the K-Pak Leave-In Protectant for 5 years, and I would not be without it.",3
5,Leaves hair noticeably shinier and easier to comb out when wet.  Hair also seems healthier.  The easier comb-out is a real plus!!,3
5,"I love these. I have most of them and really like them. Normally I'm not a fan of glosses, but these do feel like a hybrid of a balm and a gloss, but lean toward gloss texture. Most of these don't have a lot of color, but Truffle Kiss is pretty good. It's a warm brown shade that looks a dressed-up nude on lips, easily looking very natural or giving enough coverage to give lips a bit of life. (You can build it up for more intensity.) It has a touch of shimmer, but just a touch. Staying power is OK. There's not really any scent or flavor, which is a bonus in my book.",3

5,Prefect replacements for my Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men's Razor. These are smooth and shave very nicely on gentle and rough skin!,3
4,"Feels good, but attracts ants, due to its sugar content.",3
5,"This lotion is the perfect moisturizer for balancing problematic, acne-prone, oily, sensitive, hormonal, reactive skin. It doesn't give too much moisture, just enough to heal rawness and redness. It also seems to normalize the skin pH so that it doesn't get too oily or too dry. I can't live without this lotion. I pray that they never discontinue it! My skin stays perfect as long as I use it. I've tried oil-free moisturizers from Shideido, Dr Brandt, Bliss, Clinique, Philosophy, etc, and this is BY FAR the best at regulating sebum and keeping skin clear without irritation.",3
5,I used one of these in a hotel and said I have to have one. Looked in Amazon and bought this unit. Perfect for the bathroom for makeup l.,3
4,"The only problem with this polish is this that it chips. I cannot wear it on my fingernails without it chipping off. As far as the antifungal properties, it works. I had issues with my big toe from a bad pedicure. This polish has cleared everything up. I tried tea tree oil and other liquid antifungals and they did nothing. Recommend for use on toenails only, due to the chipping.",3
5,"Love this eyeliner! It's a little small and short but it's great for on the go and easy lines. I personally like to smudge and smoke out my eyeliner and the little sponge at the tip is perfect for this! The finish can be intense and dark or smoky and soft, it's all up to you! Love how smoothly it is applied, no tugging or pulling necessary. Overall, I would purchase this product again. :)",3
5,My hair is getting thinner and I've researched all of the ingredients in this shampoo and they are quite beneficial for the hair. I'm already noticing a difference in my hair and how much better it feels. I can't wait to further test this product. This product is also 100% natural so it's got my approval.,3
5,"Most tanning/bronzing lotions don't show results right after using them but this one definitely does! For people as white as I am, that's a miracle! Lol It's not greasy or smelly like most tanning lotions. This one smells and feels like normal lotion. It soaks in so you can go about your day without having to go home and shower to get the excess oily stuff off like other tanning lotions.",3
4,I ordered this looking for a cheaper alternative to the high end primers that you can get at MAC or Sephora and I was pleasantly surprised at how well this worked! Great texture- made my face super soft and velvety. It also held up pretty well allowing my face between 6 and 8 hours of great wear. I loved how my foundation and powder glided right over this product. Only downside is there isn't much product in the bottle. But for $6 I will be buying more!,3
4,Very good,3
5,It does make my face bright and white naturally. I will use loose powder after this bb cream. It can last 4-5 hours most.,3
5,These really work I eat one everytime I'm about to eat and I eat another after a meal and it keeps me from being bloated no lie try it especially when I eat greasy foods and whenever you eat greasy foods always remember to drink warm to hot water with your food never cold the grease freeze up making it harder to digest I got that off of dr oz show,3

4,"After recently joining the wet shaving community a few months ago, I'm still a beginner, but not completely brand new.<br /><br />Context: I'm 20 years old, with a light beard that must be shaven every few days for my job but I have super sensitive skin.<br />The Parker 99R I ordered came with 5 Shark Super Chrome blades that I actually loved. Got 2-3 shaves out of each of them.<br /><br />I then decided to splurge on these as the reviews are high and everyone claims they're godsend. However, after my first couple of shaves with them, I noticed little difference between them and the Super Shark Chrome blades, yet they cost more.<br /><br />Again, my own personal experience. Maybe some people see bigger gains with a thicker beard. Don't get me wrong, these still shave my face amazingly well and smooth. However, no better than my other blades.<br /><br />Overall: 4/5 because I can get the shame shave with cheaper blades in the same amount of passes.",3
5.0,Smells nice. Gets me clean and pleasant after a very smelly workout.,3
5,"This is by far the BEST cleanser I have ever used! It's a very rich foam that deeply cleanses but is totally gentle. I love that it is a soap free cleanser so it easily rinses off. I also learned that it works like a deep cleansing mask if I leave it on for 5 or 10 minutes before rinsing. I don't like to spend too much time in front of the mirror, so I give myself a mask about once or twice a week. For everyday I just cleanse and and immediately rinse. Either way my makeup comes off easily and my skin feels super fresh!!!",3
5,This product really works.  I have naturally curly hair and it controlled my frizz and left my hair very soft.  Although it's very expensive I will buy it again because it works.,3

4,"I have heard that Obsidian is the best tanning lotion you can buy but I sure was not paying $120 for it at salons soo I decided to order it from here instead, this item came two days after I purchased it so I was very happy. Obsidian smells amazinggg even my husband told me I smelled great after using this one day. It goes on very smooth and rubs in easily, I love it! I didnt see a huge difference after tanning once with this lotion but within the first week, I could definitely see that I went a few shades darker. I've seen other peoples say this lotion gets really hot but it only got slightly warm for me and I have used it on my face and it was fine. Overall Obsidian is an amazing lotion but for people like me that it takes a bit more to tan then it might be more of a gradual tan but it smells great, feels great on your skin, leaving it super soft even after you shower and the bottle looks pretty awesome too :)",3
5,"Best results are achieved when one uses one product at a time except OLAY SP 15 sunscreen to protect the skin.

5,"This cream is thick and non-greasy and leaves your skin feeling firm, more evenly toned and I think I see fine lines disappear instantly.  Only con with the day cream is that it apparently has a whitening ingredient so it leaves your skin white/pale. Sometimes if you rub it in completely it disappears. Or, I use the night cream during the day which does not have the whitening effect. As far as long term results, I have no idea!",3
5,"This brush is wonderful. I have been very happy with the quality, it is not loosing bristles yet.  Also, it's design makes it super easy to use.",3
4,I have never had an issue.  The fabric is soft and lasts for years.  Good for everyone.  Great price. Good value.,3

5,I love this salt. Salt baths really help my daughter's eczema.,3
5,Covers and blends extremely well!  I had never used a foundation or a BB cream before and now I know that I'll need to use one from now on.  It truly does perfect and even the skin tone of your face and without being heavy or looking like a mask.  Amazing!,3

My mom told me to try Avon anew, so I looked online and seen great results from women of all ages, creeds and skin types. It was little pricey so I decided I wasn't going to get it until I looked on amazon. The price was really cheap and I was happy to see results with this product within a few days!!!! My skin is fair and I can already see the difference in appearance in my skin. I put it on every morning and every night. My face is much smoother and brighter. My skin feels tighter and the product isn't oily. Overall its great and I saved a lot of money.",3
5,"Appreciated all the reviews from everyone prior to making this selection.  I love this product!  My hair & eyebrow color is very dark, almost black & I find myself mixing the 2 colors to fill in where my brows have thinned (I'm 52), sometimes using just the lighter of the 2, which I never thought I'd even use.  I'm happy to have found this rather than using an eyebrow pencil....feathers nicely & looks more natural.  Great price, too!",3
5,Perfect gift,3
5,Love it!,3
5,Just the size I wanted. Very easy to create a beautiful bun.,3
4,I really like this lipstick. It goes on smooth and has a really fun sparkle to it. I would have given it 5 stars but I have to make note of the fact the gold is almost impossible to get off in one wipe. I had to use a moist towel to wipe several times to get a good bit of it off. But this is still fun to wear for holidays or just to add some pizazz to your outfit if you're going out for a fun nite.,3
4,Nice quality.  feels weighty in the hand and sturdy.  Not sure if it's stainless or maybe low grade stainless.<br /><br />But both ends are nice and sharp for cleaning cuticles and cleaning under nails.<br /><br />4 stars only because it took 4 weeks to receive it.  Even media mail is faster than that.,3
5,"Comparable to Sigma. So amazing for the price. Have washed several times and has never shed, and dries perfectly back into shape. 5 stars",3
4,"I bought it some months back, use it always.<br />Good: It is great for my skin. I compare it to SebaMed.<br />Not so good: leaves skin less of natural body-oil, dry.<br /><br />My skin type is sensitive, medium oily. i dislike soaps for reasons of irritation and a layer of soapy-chemicals, which cause allergic reactions, illness.<br /><br />I am still searching for something 'natural' that cleans, won't give dryness, won't leave its residue (layer of chemicals) on skin.",3
5,"Impeccably fast shipping. Great product. Scent is a little strong, but otherwise no complaints!",3
4,"So the reason I got this was because I have a bunch of acne scars on my face. I'm African American so the scars were black. I'm brown skin so the scars show up horribly. Any hoo, I don't want to eggagerate so I won't say I noticed a difference in the first few days. For sure I noticed the difference in the first week. Not only did it lighten up the scars, it lightened up my complexion in general. I had to start putting it on my neck too just so my neck would match my face. My chest and top of my arms are pale from wearing long sleeve shirts so I don't have to worry about that, but I might start using it on my hands and legs. Oh, I used it on my knees and elbows and it made a big difference there too. People are staring to asked me am I mixed or am ISpanish because of how light my face got, I keep telling them it's just because it's cold out ;). The only possible bad thing is that I noticed I broke out when I first started using this, the more I used it, the worse my skin got. Like I'm talking my whole face was covered in red pimples. I didn't want new scars to worry about so I started using that new Proactiv. Perfect combination. The proactiv stops me from breaking out and this stuff is fading the old and new acne scars I have. That is the only reason I didn't give this five stars; I think my skin was too sensitive and it was the reason I had that awful breakout. I will continue to buy this though because it does work.",3
5,I have been using this eye cream for several weeks now.  It is gentle and I have even put it on my face.  It is light and does not leave my pores clogged.  It is creamy and has a natural feeling.  It is odorless and perfect for the very sensitive skin that I have.,3
5,LOVE this product!!!  Been using it for years!!!! :),3

5,wear it and love it.  Great for dry skin with a nice soft scent,3
5,Great!,3
4,"I have been through a series of different trimmers and shavers before I settled on this one. I've tried a few rotary shavers and haven't had great success, so I decided to switch to a foil design. My first impression was that it didn't pull any hairs, a problem I had with numerous rotary designs. It also was the closest shave other than my conventional razor, granted I primarily use this product on my neck, where I do not want to use my razor. Here's my quick pros and cons list:<br />Pros - Long battery life<br />  Cuts well after extended use (not sure when I'll have to replace the blades)<br />  Close, smooth shave<br />  The back trimmer works as designed<br /><br />Cons - Can't get it wet<br />  Although it cuts very close, many times in areas on my neck I had to continuously alternate between the shaver and the<br />  trimmer portion in order to cut a few hairs.<br />  The back trimmer is obviously designed for small areas of longer hair, so I wouldn't stray to far from the front and back of<br />  the neck.<br /><br />I will continue to use this product until it fails me, hopefully not within a few years. I plan on eventually upgrading, maybe to a Braun 7-series.",3
5,Very satisfied. Would purchase again.,3
5,"I usually stay up reading for a while after my wife goes to sleep. We have an overhead light on the headboard, and after she turns in, I angle it more to my side, but it still shines on her. It doesn't usually keep her awake, but she tried the sleep mask and liked it very much, saying that it was very comfortable and it kept the light out of her eyes. The light elastic strap held the mask in place, but didn't bind. She noted that the mask was of excellent construction quality with uniform, tight stitching.<br /><br />A product sample was provided by Fishers Finery on the promise of an honest, unbiased review.",3
5,"The brush gives volume to my fine and thin hair.  But what I don't like is the color of the hair brush.  The picture shows a nice baby blue coloured brush but I  received a green coloured hair brush.  They should have  allowed me to choose the colour of the hair brush, if not  sent me the same coloured hair brush as the picture posted on the website.[[ASIN:B000E2DUK6 Isinis Hair Brush # 440 Small (Purse Size) No Ball Tip]]",3
5,"It is the BEST.!! I used it all my life, I am 82 years old. I would be disappointed if it was ever discontinued.",3
5,I have seen a difference in the shades of my teeth within the three weeks since I've started using this product. I recommend this pre-rinse to anyone that wishes to increase the whiteness of their teeth.,3
5,"I've only been using this for a couple days but I have to say it works really well! My face doesn't have any dry patches anymore nor does it feel super oily (I have combo skin).  This really helps and benefits you if you put it on BEFORE a moisturizer! That's the way it's intended to be used.  It's made my skin have this kinda glow and supple, my boyfriend even asked me if I was wearing make up 'cause my skin looked so smooth and I wasn't wearing anything! This is a dang good price for the amount as well. I'm not dissapointed!",3
5.0,"I bought this on a whim, while my wife was ordering some girl stuff from Sephora. I am glad I did. It is really good shaving cream. It has a strong citrus aroma (orange and lemon), which does not linger long. It is rich in oils to lubricate and moisturize both the beard and the skin.<br />It works as advertised. A LITTLE dab will do ya. I expect this shave cream to last the better part of a year.",3
5.0,I love this shampoo! I have the global keratin treatment in my hair so I have to use sulfate free shampoos.  I also have a problem with dandruff.  I am so happy I finally found a sulfate free dandruff shampoo that works.  I would recommend this to anyone that needs sulfate free with dandruff issues.  This product is a miracle for my hair.,3
5,"It came quickly and works perfectly, saved my husband's favorite shaver from certain death. We appreciated you carrying a replacement for an item 40 years old.",3
5,Great product! NOT fake as some were saying it is. Definitely will be buying this again in the future 👍,3
4,nice coverage,3
5,This is a great company. I got this product and didn't feel it was as described and they replaced it and sent me a bonus gift for the trouble. The smell is mild. The soap box it comes in is beyond beautiful!,3
5,This product works very nicely when used consistently.  I love the smell and the way it spreads on the skin.  Definitely worth every penny spent on it!,3
5,These are my first wheels and I loved how they came before the estimated date. What a great way to show the polishes,3
5,This is my second sonicare I have purchased.  I really like the smaller handle with the rubber sides.  I like the thinner toothbrush and the 30-second timer in this new model.  The light indicates how much battery life is remaining.  Very pleased with my new sonicare and all the improvements since my older version.,3
5.0,Feels nice.  Tingles slightly.  Part of my nightly routine.,3
5,I just started treatment. 2 days ago. My biggest concern was my turkey neck. Not a lot of progress there but my forced and parenthesis are diminished. Hoping for better results with time.  By the gel when you but the machine,3
4,"I saw this as Walmart for under $3 which is a great price for a good working dry shampoo. I haven't had any issues with this. I spray it into my roots and then kind of massage it in with my fingers, then I spray 8-10 inches away a sweep over my entire head and then I brush it through. If you use too much it will be white/gray and you will have to work it in. The bottle says if the nozzle clogs rinse in warm water. I'm not sure if thats the problem that people are having. I've used it probably 5-7 times and the bottle feels nearly full. I actually like the smell, but thats just a matter of personal preference I guess. Overall, for the price I really like this product and will be purchasing it again. It definitely allows you to skip a shampoo or two!",3
4,It works well but probably not as well as some of the more expensive preparations.  I'm hypothyroid so hair loss is a concern.  This does keep my eyebrows and eyelashes intact.,3
5,"The product is good. I bought it for my father, and he likes it very much. And it deliever fast.",3
5,Use this every day. It lasts forever. It's all about how you make it work for you. Good buy,3
4,What can you say about razor blades? They do the job.<br />They do the job/ They do the job.Thank you.,3
4.0,"This gel works pretty well, but is extremely expensive for the small amount you get.  I will be looking for a more cost effective product as this tube only lasts 3-5 weeks.",3
4,OK product,3
5,Bueno muy bueno,3
5,excellent product....excellent service!!! Highly recommend.,3
5,"Great texture blush, Blends easly and looks natural.  This in not my color however.  I am light olive and needed to get the ROSE instead.  This would be good for light complextions.  More of a peach undertone.",3
5.0,Love them thank u and got them a few weeks early,3
4,I bought these as a cheap alternative to expensive replacement cartridges. Here is a trick...you can gently pull the blade off these and use in on your Mach 3 handle.,3
4,I have used conair curling irons in the past and have never been disappointed. I like the automatic shut off because I have a problem remembering if I turned the iron off.,3
5.0,"I bought this for my dog grooming shop. It arrived when expected, was easy to assemble, and does the job I needed it to do.",3
5.0,"What's nice about this product is that it is pure argan oil with no added chemical or other ingredients. I use a dab on my hair after washing, to protect it and tame frizz. I also put a little on my skin to keep it moisturized. This product comes in a nice glass bottle with an easy to use dispenser. I love that the company supports Mother Earth in their philosophy and appreciates the natural beauty secrets of the Moroccan women.",3
4,This is my first time to use Clinique products. I think they are suitable for me. Only one thing: that moisturize lotion is for dry skin.......,3
4,"Wild Growth Oil is a very good choice to help your hair grow if it needs moisture, not protein. The top ingredients include olive, coconut and jojoba oils.I personally like that there are no artificial perfumes added. It is kind of strong, but I personally don't mind the smell too much. ( Some people find the smell to be intolerable.)If you put a few drops in your hair after washing it (don't use too much!), then use a hair dryer, the smell will evaporate mostly anyway. It leaves my hair very soft and shiny looking, and it has grown a couple inches.",3
5,"I've used every product known for hair loss.The combination of ingredients in this product can't be found anywhere else. The fact that there's a 70-80% reduction in hair in the drain after showering tells me all I need to know. Very satisfied. Per the instructions for effectiveness, leave the product on your head for 2 minutes after lathering, before rinsing off.",3
5,Excellent product<br />Arrived on time<br />Strongly recommend<br />Excellent battery<br />Most razors I had better<br /><br />Cons -<br />Comes without a case,3
5,Still working fine after a few years of admittedly occasional use. Battery lasts a long time. No problems noticed so far.,3
5,Great seller! Wonderful,3
4,"This is a quality product, sturdy and well-built, but a bit smaller than I would have liked. The 10x side definitely gives you all the close up action you could possibly need, though. Over all it's a good mirror, but wouldn't mind it being a bit bigger as I planned on using it as my primary mirror to do my grooming in.",3
5,"Amazing!! It's just great quality! I love it for putting on my powder foundation, and to put on blush :) totally recommend it",3
5,Exactly what I ordered. Appreciated!!,3
5.0,great for getting rid of orange hair,3
5,This dryer is fabulous.  I have thick curly hair and this dryer dried my hair in half the time it normally takes and without the frizz.  I love it.  The only downfall is that it is substantially heavier then any other drier I have owned.,3
5,I'm glad I found this product again.  Apparently the company isn't manufacturing it anymore.  It is great for my type of hair.  The purchase was nice and easy and quick.,3
5,"I ordered the light brown. I liked the color very much. I have a few greys in med brown hair. I left it on 1 hour and it covered the grey and left dementional highlights with an auburn look to it...lovely and shiney.<br />The color is more a med brown then light brown and you need to like red highlights. Maybe for a lighter color try 1/2 hour.<br />I did add the vinagar and the chamomile tea as suggested in other posts, then followed the other directions in the pkg. It was easy to mix.<br />I would reorder.",3
5,I really love the color and the way it shines. It works as great as any other product I have tried. The smell is great too.,3
5,I used a several times for my face and hair. I liked this product it makes my skin feel smooth and silky.,3
5,Bought it for my sister. She enjoyed it. Good brand so expect good quality. no complains. Would buy again yes,3
5.0,Great color and feels great on your lips.  No funky smell.  My only negative  is that it doesn't stay on very long.,3
5,"Loved it! worked perfectly, used it for couple of weeks and perfect tone! I will definitely buy more of this product!",3
4,"I have had a leg discrepancy for 20 years.  I spent  so much money to have my shoes &#34;built-up&#34;. As a result,  I put up with a left shoe that felt stiff and had added weight.  The shoes never did feel right.<br />I did some reading online and read lots of reviews.  I hesitated on using this G&W Heel Lift because it was made of a<br />hard plastic. A good note is that these G&W lifts are a little longer and fit in my shoe well. . I tape the lift in my shoe and then add an instep sole on top. (This depends upon how much room you might have available in your heel area.  Please note that you have to experiment to find the right shoe style that works with this add-on.  Buy the add-on lift and take it with you when<br />you buy shoes. I ended up buying a lift for each pair of shoes I own.  It is easier than trying to re-use just (one lift). Hope this review helps someone.",3
5,"I have tried several eyelash curlers.  They all worked to varying degrees.  However, just when I \\""broke them in\\"" they would break or need a new pad.  This electric curler has solved all of my problems.  I will admit it took me a while to get the hang of it.  I was really used to squeezing the old kind so hard that my hand hurt.  Now I let the heat do the work.  I had to practice getting the angle right so my lashes looked the way I wanted, and I was nervous at first about the heat near my eye.  Now that I've been using it for a month I love it!  My lashes have never looked better.  I had a few days where it seemed to not be working so well, but all I did was change the batteries and PRESTO!  It continues to work great.  I would not recommend this product for people not used to using a curler.  Practice with the non-heated kind first.",3
5.0,I am big on trying different tanning lotions to see which one will give me the best color and I really loved this one. One thing I look for mainly in purchasing a new lotion is the after smell it leaves when you are finished tanning. I hate to smell like burnt skin or some kind of greasy fast food. This does not leave you with an unpleasant smell at all. I love it! I smell just as fresh as before I put it on. Absolutely recommend.,3
5,Works great but the brush can be better,3
5,This stuff is incredible!! I used this on a burn I had on my hand (from hot soup) and it went away.  I also used it on a rash I had on my chest (remniscent of blister/burn) and it completely went away!!! I can't say enough good things about this product- it really is a miracle oil!!,3
5,I love this when my friend recommended this to me. It helps me to relieve my eyes after working with computers for too long. Also very good for taking a nap!,3
5,I prefer these cloths versus the wipes.  I prefer the soapy kind.  This is a great price and they came quickly.  I will order again.,3
5,"My skin is better than ever, and my make up goes on flawlessly with this product. Knocks the socks off of Oil of O'Lay!",3
5,"I love this product!!  It really helps with irritation, especially if you use it for a few days before you shave.",3
5,My husband only uses this face soap.  He absolutely loves it.  I like it to to use every now and then when I want an exfoliating wash.  It gives me a fresh clean feeling.,3
5.0,"This is a great all-around shampoo.  I use it on grandchildren, but also keep it in the guest bathroom for guests of all ages.  I use it myself, and it is what I fill my travel vials with, because you never need a conditioner with it.  It is just great, and must be PH balanced, because I have sensitive skin.  When it arrives, I pour it into a decent looking bottle, since I can't bear the ugly cartoons, but it works very well, and I live with it!  I will be very lost when it is discontinued, as I haven't found a close second choice for my family.",3
5.0,"awesome product, smells nice too, not too overwhelming just great scent lathers good.",3
5.0,It is very creamy ; yes I like iy,3
5,"I love it! Came with two chains incase one breaks but no issues really! Fast shipping, and really I love wearing it! Its not white its more clear! But still bad ass to wear! :)",3
5,Love it,3
5,"This is my new favorite perfume, every time I wear it I get so many compliments.  Highly recommend no mater what your age is.",3
5,"Yes this is my color, been using since a few grey strands have been making there appearance.  This color is hard to find I purchased a surplus to have for the future",3
4,Gifted this to my aunt. She likes it and says that this is a great temporary solution to touch up the roots (and cover up the grey) between color appointments.,3
5.0,This product combined with the Glycoloic 10% cream nightly has totally changed my face. This has cleared up my acne tremendously! Love this!!!,3
5,This is the perfect highlighter!  The texture is nice and blends well! on the cheeks over blush.  I highly recommend this product!,3
5.0,Good product  makes me smell good!!!,3
4,Smells great and is very hydrating without being greasy.  I've gone through several bottles of this and have been very pleased with the product.,3
5.0,"Love it! works great on my hair, face and body. I have gray hair and just a small amount on my wet hair keeps my hair from getting frizzy and gives it a good shine. I also use it as my facial moisturizer. Smooths out my skin and by using it daily I have fewer fine lines, especially on my neck. Able to get it for a much lower price than buying from a drug store and this is a much better product.",3
5,"This is the most refreshing, wonderful scented scrub I have ever used. I just cannot get enough of it,.  bit pricey, but worth the money. My skin feels great after using it.",3
5,"I like other products made by Avalon and the shampoo does not disappoint. I love the invigorating peppermint essential oil, and the shampoo leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable. I particularly appreciate the nontoxic ingredients, and also noticed that my hair has stopped falling out as I am no longer picking it out of the shower drain.",3
5,I have adapted this to use in my own way!  I have highlighted very fine and thick hair that has a curl in it and tends to go very 'frizzy' especially as I live in a very hot and humid environment.  I don't like blow drying or ironing my hair so thought I would give this a go.  I spray a little on wet and freshly washed but not conditioned hair and just leave it to dry naturally.  the first day it just feels very soft and is a little 'flatter'.  By the second day it is smooth and soft and exactly how i want it. I put it up during this time and it doesn't effect it.  For the next few washes it stays like this.  I wash my hair every 2-3 days.  Then when it gets frizzy again i just repeat.  Love it!,3
5,"It works great, smells good (the scent dissipates pretty soon after application), and leaves no oily residue or sticky feeling. My only complaint was that the lid was not on the bottle as tight as it should have been, and it arrived with an oily label and a cap that was not quite snug. Didn't stop me from using it thought, and it feels great for daily use!",3
5,"My children are those white and pastey kids you see on the beach.  This sunscreen keeps them from burning every time.  We used it at the beach on many occasions and at a water park.  Neither got burned.  I can't find this sport spray anywhere locally, so now I can combing the Net trying to find what I can.  The Mosquito version works nicely as well.",3
4,Pros:<br />-make hair soft<br />-promotes hair growth a lot<br />-reduces hair fall<br /><br />Cons:<br />-very expensive for a hair oil<br />-doesn't smell good.,3
4,"This smells beautiful, love it! The only thing is, it's too expensive. Going to try another brand before buying this again.",3
5,"It made my hair soft. I can feel that my hair was getting nourishment. Also I noticed after a couple use-i use it every weekend with my deep conditioner, that my gray hair in the front of my head, were less noticeable.",3
5.0,Muy Bien Gracias!!!,3
5,"I really love these MASH treatments, they go on smooth and they really make a difference from what I was using. I highly recommend this to anyone. They're great! :)",3
5,I love using this facewash! It makes my face feel so clean and refreshed. The lemon smell is so refreshing in the morning and the way it foams up and the sugar dissolves is so awesome!! AMAZING Proguct!!,3
5,"This is the finest eye treatment I have ever used. I only wish it was available in stores. I use this with my Clairsonic Opal, am almost 43 and the eye wrinkles are still staying away. I have been using this product for 3 years. Simply phenomenal.",3
5,This is great night cream.  I have dry skin and wear a light moisturizer during day under foundation but have been using this at night and it really moisturizes without a heavy cold cream feel.  I usually still feel moisturized in the morning.  It's worth the price.,3
4,"I am in love with this bb cream!!! I have not yet tried the pink ( I was supposed to get a sample, I am contacting the seller about that!), but I do LOVE the gold, as far as I could tell from other reviews and from youtube the gold is more tinted (for tan or darker shaded people, since I havnt tried the pink I can not tell you that for sure though-I will update on that once I try the pink!), but unlike other reviews, I have not had a problem with this \\""running off my face, ect\\"". I think the key to that is if you use a moisturizer, and if so what type. I have been using this for almost 2 weeks, and can already tell a difference in my skin! I am normally fair skin, but not white fair, more of a light almost but not quite medium fair, but I do tan, however I do not tan as much on my face, since I use a high spf cream on my face when tanning, but I normally use makeup to match the difference so my skin tone matches my face, but this blends in well and matches my tan skin tone perfectly, without the need of anything else, however I normally do set it with a light loose powder, but not always!<br />UPDATE:<br />just want everyone to know that I rated this on product alone, not on the seller or anything other than the product... however I do want to add that the seller has never sent my sample of pink bb cream... I noted this and reviewed the seller in the section to review sellers, I will not change my product review because of the seller, but I do want you to know that I did not receive the sample, so if you are ordering to receive that then you may want to just order the bb cream from any seller, and not go for this just to get the sample like I did... but this was part of the description, and part of the order of product, that is why I am changing my rating, not because of the seller, but because I did not have the full product to rate, and in some case you could say it was missing a part, like if you order a 2 part item, and only receive one part, you would rate it low because it was defective and only received one part, I am torn here on this, changing the rating of the product, but since there is many of these that are offered and not with the sample, I want my rating to reflect that I didn't receive the full product as described. and this has no effect on the rating of the bb cream itself, on the gold, I give it 5 stars still...",3
4,"I have tried various things to help with my snoring. This does seem to help. I am dreaming more at night,so I must be sleeping better.",3
5,"I have been using this facial moisturizer for years!!  I finally discovered Earth Science: Almond Aloe Facial Moisturizer SPF 15 ages ago after an extensive (and expensive) multi-brand trial and error process of locating (and committing to) a facial moisturizer that included an SPF.<br /><br />MY MAJOR REQUIREMENT:<br />I DID NOT want my face to feel as if it was covered in cellophane(like many products do).<br />I DID NOT want anything that made my face shiny.<br />I DID NOT CARE about the cost.  (I'm broke, but hey.. this is my face!!)<br /><br />I just needed to find what worked.. and this was it!<br /><br />I didn't choose it because of the UNBELIEVABLY LOW price, I chose it because it DOES NOT feel or look heavy, greasy, or shiny.. After shaving feels so smooth and nice.. It has a NICE light almond scent (also comes unscented).. And again you CAN'T beat the price!!<br />Best of all, just a little goes a LOOOOOONG way.<br /><br />Just try it.. you wont be dissapointed!!  Especially if you use the Earth Science Clarifying Facial Wash and their facial scrub occasionally too!!",3
5,This is the best razor in the Market and they last a lot.Highly recommended.I wished  it was easier to find.,3
5,"So when I received my unit it didnt look like it was new but rather than going through the hassle of returning it, i decided to just try it.<br />I have failed at horribly at home Brazillian waxing in the past, including using the GiGi Microwave hard wax.<br />This stuff works really well.  It is easy to pull and doesn't ever get &#34;too hard.&#34; It flexes as you pull which isnt true of all hard waxes.  The wax is a bit runny/messy so you may want to invest in some collars though it's not absolutely necessary (the kit comes with one).<br /><br />It took me about an hour to do my arms and my entire area down there.  It was amazing! Yay for not having to shell out for Brazillians anymore - the cost of this is even less than one Brazillian wax with a Groupon!<br /><br />TIP - I had some numbing solution from a previous kit and applied that that first - this is a MUST! You need to order this separately, the kit does not come with it.  Then use the oil (which is included) right before you apply the wax.",3
4,"The salt obligingly scratches your itchy hide while the oils soften you up.<br /><br />Don't try to rinse it all off, either as it will absorb but yo want that nice barrier on your itchy dry winter skin.<br />Just be careful in the tub as it tends to get slippery in there.",3
5,"This curling iron heats up quickly and with the swivel cord is exceptionally easy to use. (I'm beginning to wonder why I even own a curling iron that doesn't have a swivel cord.) It advertises that it heats up to 400 degrees, however, the settings aren't actually in degrees. I will never understand why manufacturers do this. It heats up to 400 degrees but we won't tell you what the temperature of any settings are other than the highest setting :p Of course, I guess I could do the math but who wants to do math when they're doing their hair?<br /><br />Anyways, that's just my pet peeve. The curling iron works well and better than other curling irons I own. I don't know if it's because this curling iron is new or if it's the special combination of copper and gold, but it works well on my hard to curl hair and gives my hair a nice wave that lasts for about half the day. (I know, you're probably thinking well that's no good, but trust me, it is. Curls usually fall flat on me in two hour or less unless I dump an entire can of hairspray on my head.)<br /><br />I've used many Revlon products and beauty tools before and never been disappointed and this curling iron is no exception.",3
5,"Dial Basics is one of my favorite bar soaps.  It is the main soap that I use to wash my hands.  It is hypoallergenic and does not irritate my sensitive, allergic skin.  Be aware it does contain fragrance in the ingredients, but the scent is very, very light.  So light it almost smells like there is no fragrance.  It is a clean scent not flowery or fruity.  It does not contain any artificial colors it is white. This is one of the only soaps that does not dry out my hands.  It is a great simple soap.",3
5.0,"Super fast shipping, ordered it in the morning, received it in the afternoon. This is the real Clarisonic replacement brush head, vibrates in the outer ring, spins in the center. Will buy again!",3
5,I loved this perfume. I get so many compliments. My favorite scent right now.,3
5,Made a lovely gift.,3
5,"This is so wonderful, leaves your skin soft. I use it with an apricot scrub( Or natuural ) because I dont like using micro beads because they contain plastic. I also use it to clean my rings!",3
4,"On our trip to Hawaii, we purchased five types of safe sunscreens considered safe by the Environmental Working Group ([...]), in order to do our own \\""research\\"" on the effectiveness and ease of use for each product and settle on one for all our future trips. We did a comparitive analysis of the products, using each of them multiple times throughout our trip. (You may see these first two sentences when we review the other products. Sorry about that.)     Of the five products we tested, this was absolutely the most effective, even for one of our extremely sun-sensitive group members.  It was also the hardest to apply, however, and the adults in our group refused to use it on their faces as the week wore on.  The problem is how thick it is and the fact that it does not disappear even with repeated massaging of it into your skin. (I've read the reviews here that say otherwise, but we rubbed and rubbed and were still blue-white.)  For kids who don't mind being a sort of bluish-white color, or those who will tolerate being rubbed quite a bit when you apply it, it will do a great job keeping them safe.  No one had a reaction to the ingredients, which was what we expected based on other reviews.  Finally, it didn't even come off in the water, although you might want to re-apply after swimming just to be on the safe side.",3
4.0,I ordered this trimmer oil from this seller because I wanted a small little bottle that I could put in my hair trimmer kit. Instead of the .33oz. bottle I got 4oz. I saw this same sized bottle from another seller for a better price but I bought this one because I really wanted the smaller bottle. With one hair cut for my hubby every 6-8wks it will take me years to use this up and it won't fit inside my trimmer set.,3
5,My mother in law looked high and low for this product.  Amazon had it and many more.  I put together a nice package of these for her for Christmas and she wondered where in the world I found them.....  &#34;Amazon....  of course&#34; was my answer.,3
5,I live near the beach and spend hours walking by the shore barefoot. My feet are not a pretty sight unless dry and rough look good to you. They also itch like crazy. I use this daily after I thoroughly wash my feet with peppermint soap. I massage this into my clean feet and then put on soft cotton socks.<br />This works well and restores the moisture and keeps my feet soft. It has a wonderful coconut scent which I absolutely love. As a regular user I totally recommend this foot cream for its effectiveness and wonderful scent.,3
5,I have sensitive skin and other skin realited health proublems. My doctor has given me samples of soaps and body washes to try. But my skin has always been horribly dry during the winter months. And the soaps the doctor suggested was super expensive. My friend gave me a bottle of Dove Sensitive Skin Nourishing and it is like my skin is someone else. Instead of being dry and harsh it is smooth and wonderful. If you need a good body wash to help to rehydrate your skin during the harsh winter months I highly suggest this stuff. I save a bundle now because I don't have to put on so much body lotion.  IT is wonderful stuff.,3
5,"I tried manual clippers in the past but found they had sharp edges and were too big for my smallish nostrils anyway. Instead, I used cuticle scissors for nose and ear trims. When I stumbled over the battery operated Panasonic ER411 I decided to give it a try. That was last month. I've used it twice so far and it's terrific. The cutting head is smaller than I expected and fits comfortably in nostrils and ears. And with no sharp edges exposed it's easy and pleasant to use. Great tool.",3
4,i bought this product for my boyfriend because its way cheaper than if i would have bought it at a dept. store. the wait is well worth the price. it came in well packaged (in orininal box). looked new. there was something floating in the perfume like little bits of dust. it might have been just that one bottle- who knows. when i gave the bottle to the expert he said that it smell exactly like what he has been wearing. other than that minor defect it's a great product.,3
5.0,best soap ever!! perfect for washing your face without overdrying,3

5.0,Works well and tastes and smells great!,3
5,"I started cutting my own hair after going to a barber for 20 years that used the original Pinaud. So I bought my own and ahhhhh.... I love it! A great, nostalgic scent and a pleasant sting as it tightens up your skin. The smell is not overpowering but I notice it lasts a LONG time, which I like. Highly recommend.",3
5,"Trust when I say I have been wearing this perfume for over 10yrs and this oil is a GREAT in between if you can't afford the real deal...Smells just like it!!! Purchase, Purchase,Purchase!!!!",3
4,Ordered these for my wife who breaks reading glasses with incredible ease. So far none broken after 8 weeks. Likes the style as well. Thanks,3
5,I was first introduced to this facial cleanser by my daughter.  I love it.  It gives you face a nice tingle and has a mud-like consistency that works great as a buffer.,3
5,"I'm using these for my hair, little braids upfront.It was hard to find small rubberbands and these fit the bill! Thank you! Ginger/Chicago",3
5,THIS PRODUCT IS WONDERFUL AS A LEAVING TRATMENT AND DETANGLER.  MY ONLY MISTAKE WAS TO BUY IT BY MISTAKE IN 2 OZ SIZE.  THIS SMALL SIZE WORKS FINE FOR TRAVELLING BUT AT HOME YOU NEED THE 8.5 OZ SIZE.,3
4,love it,3
5,"This is a present for an active niece who runs races, so the sports theme attracted to me to this perfume.  The other reviews were very good, so I was not surprised to find the scent very nice, something I hope the niece likes.",3
5.0,"I like the scent of the \\""new\\"" lotion. Not only that, but it solves my skin's propensity to dryness very effectively. [[ASIN:B006L5BPCU St. Ives Intensive Healing Body Lotion, 21 Ounce]]",3
4,"I think this is a great mascara! The lengthening portion is amazing and seriously makes my eyelashes look like they're going for miles! And it really is waterproof, so you'll need a really good makeup remover to get it off or it won't come off. My only issue is that it doesn't really thickens my eyelashes like it says it should. So many people say that it's great at volumizing, so that makes me wonder if I'm just applying it wrong. Hmm. Anyway, I might try buying another Maybelline mascara for volume and try layering it. But this product is great!",3
5.0,"I absolutely love this soap and love the brand.  I use this on my face.  My skin is combination & very sensitive - the ingredients in here are mild on my skin.  I've tried nearly every brand of facial wash and bar soaps from $1 - $60 and for me, it's all just hype.  As long as I have a good moisturizer and zit cream for back up in case of a rare breakout - I'm good.  I'm so glad this is offered on Amazon and at a good price.  Thank you!",3
5,Still using it 2 years later.<br />Perfect tooth brush.,3
5,"I love this perfume!  The bottle is simple, elegant and light.... like the scent!  \\""Pure\\"" describes the perfume notes perfectly, lasts a pretty long time.  Also is great for the office and/or going out on the weekend!  Buy the 3.7 oz, it will definitely last for a long time; just spray lightly!",3
5,"Bristles are firm yet flexible and very soft. This brush is perfect for applying blush to my cheekbones, and it arrived very quickly!",3
5.0,Good product so far.,3
5,"It's does the same job as the stuff my salon was selling me, but at such a lower cost. I will be buying more!",3
5.0,Kids love them!,3
5,perfect,3
5,"This product does work and it is cheaper on Amazon than at the drug store or even Wal-Mart!  Try the \\""express\\"" version, it worked overnight on me and this product helps to keep the color.",3
4,"If you want to add some pucker to your pout but have heard some negatives about DuWop's full strength Lip Venom, LV Lite is worth a try. It goes on like sheer lip gloss, but lends some plump a few minutes after application. And unlike the original, Lip Venom Lite isn't uncomfortably tingly. You won't end up with lips like Angelina Jolie, but you'll notice a difference, albeit temporary. This is a small vial so it's not cheap, but a little will go a long way if you don't use it with a heavy hand.",3
5,my hair is gray/white so keeping it in line is a bit of a job.  coconut oil hair shine calms my hair and gives it a fabulous shiny look.,3
5,"A little goes a long way with this. It does exactly as described, however too much of it makes your hard and crunchy. I had curly hair and crunchy is not what I like. It's still great just only use a little.",3
5.0,I can't say much more than: it is amazing! go ahead and try it! I am buying another one of it! It was seriously better than I expected!,3
5,Love this product.  Creamy and really helps with tissue under the eyes.  Very sad to see that this product is being discontinued.,3
5,"These sell for much,much more in local drug stores.  An excellent value.  They appear to be an exact replacement for the originals.",3
5,this maternity support is the best of there kinds that are out there in the world! with 2 small children at home and #3 on the way i had already tryed the other kids of supports and belts THEY DIDNT work so we found this one and i thought i should try it.. I am going to use it after baby as well it feels great! helps with my feet hurting my lower back hurting my upper back and my sholders as well the only adjustment is when you are needing to sit down and get up its not very easy at all.. you have a adjust and get used to it then you get good at it..,3
5,I switched from the multiple blade plastic gimmicky razors to this after a friend referred me. It's really disappointing to realize what I've been missing out on all these years! This razor is awesome and I really enjoy using it every day. I highly recommend!,3
5,"This lipstick is a great one if you want a red, not too bright, I have fair, golden skin and it is the only red that does not look garish on me... It complements my complexion well in any light setting..",3
5,Does just what it says on the bottle!  Quality product from a quality company.,3
5,"Awesome lotion.  I'm a guy and not usually a moisturizer freak.  At least not up until now.  There's just something about this stuff that's more pleasant than other lotions.  Has fewer and simpler ingredients compared to other lotions.  No irritation or greasy feeling, nothing.",3
5,"I have been using this product for over six months and I totally LOVE it as it leaves my hair silky, shiny and smelling great... Extremely happy customer!!!",3
4,"They work well, but since they are the first pair I've owned I have nothing to compare them with! Helps extend the life of a short haircut, which has gone from floppy to perky again.",3
5.0,love it,3
4,"You don't need to bring a ton of cologne on travel, and these are great for carry-on liquids.  Very small but like I said perfect for travel.  Bought this as a companion size for my husband.",3
4,"The sizes are perfect for travel, and if you use MK facial products this is what you will want to take with you.  I think all their little sizes are pretty pricey, but I was happy to have these with me for a long trip away from home.",3
5,Exactly what I expected! love them,3
5,"just amazing!!! they came in a black case, 5 dotting pens and 3 brushes plus it came with and extra nail file. Super happy with my purchase :)",3
5,Best face cleanser out there!,3
5,"Now this right here is just what it says &#34;Doesn't Get Much BUTTER Than This&#34;  I ordered two jars of this & I use it after EVERY WEEKLY WASH!!!  I tried other products before but when this first came out, it became my one & only!!! I section my hair & apply this to each section, then I twist my hair, let it dry naturally. When I untwist my hair the next day my hair is so soft & manageable. A little goes along way too. I absolutely love The Mane Choice products & tell everyone I know about trying them for themselves. I am a loyal customer & so grateful to have found products that work amazing on my hair!!!",3
5.0,The ANSR beam is great.  I suffer from hormonal breakouts and using this 2x a day has practically made my blemishes non-existent.  I highly recommend this product.,3
5,Perfect Summer Nude Nail Polish!  This has just the right shine and color for summertime.  Pinkish tone is perfect for most skin tones.,3
5,Fantastic product! Works great!,3
5,"I get a lot of compliments on this and the price is right. Light, good for both work and being out on the town.",3
5,these are a really good deal. I really can see a difference when I use these- It does take awhile to see a HUGE difference- but it is much longer lasting and reaches more of your mouth than strips do.,3
5,"I suffer from sleep apnea. Because I use a sleep machine with a face mask every night, I would be embarrassed with a ugly rash on my face. I also was always scratching my face because it itched terribly. While walking through the Lexington Mall I was stopped by a salesman who bluntly referred to my face as ugly. I was very mad at first, and then listened as he explained why the mask was causing me to break out. He introduced me to the Mask Miracle Noir and demonstrated how it was applied. My wife about killed me when I forked over $150 for the product, but has since agreed it was truly a \\""miracle\\"" my face is no longer an embarrassment to me. I use it once a week and have not had any problem since. Thank you for a truly great product!",3
5,Excellent product and fast shipping!!!!,3
4,"I like this oil, it's not expensive, it absorbs quickly, and it makes my hair feel very soft.  I do wish that it was unscented.  I have found that if applied to wet hair the scent isn't as bad.  If I put it on dry hair I smell like this oil all day.",3
5,"I've never had a bath product with such a powerful, pleasant smell.  If you like the smell of lavender, you'll love this.  It also lathers really nicely.",3
5,Love this deoderant that is free of aluminum and other bad things.  One bottle lasts a long time.,3
5,This moisturizer work great!!,3
5,I really like the feel of this. I think it needs to be in a jar instead though because it's so thick and slimy it's hard to use the eyedropper.,3
5,i am very picky when it comes to my blow dryers. I can't commit. My sister had purchased this item at Target and I loved it! It has great power for it not being a professional hair dryer. I searched for it at 3 Targets and found out they no longer carried it. i was browsing on Amazon and found it! I ordered it immediately. I am very happy I purchased this item.,3
5,This works better than dying your hair and is easy to do.  Simply apply 2-3 times/week to keep the grey out.,3
4,"it works fine. no allergies. i have tried many hair color products, they gave me severe allergies. Light Mountain is allergies free.",3
5,Just what my wife wanted and price was right.  Delivered quickly and in original packaging.  Looks to be just like what she could have gotten at the tanning salon (for less money).,3
5,"One week later I'm seeing great results. Honestly, the first day I received this, I applied it all over my body post-shower. When I woke in the morning, my face was glowing. This is amazing. It's really thick and makes my hands super oily, but worth it. I use an applicator stick.",3
5,"A must have for any post processing shampoo. I usually apply this after hair color. Wash the color off. Do not use conditioner. Apply the treatment. Put a shower cap or a resizable plastic hair cap and leave it on as long as possible. After that, Wash and condition as usual. I can still smell the product about 10 shampoos after. Hair is super soft, holds color shine and becomes more tamed after color processing. I have natural kinky but not tight curls. Medium to dark Mediterranean hair type, very long length. Hope this helps.",3
5,both my son and my dad have very sensitive skin so this is perfect for them,3
4,"so far , so good. need to take longer to see more results.",3
5,Love love love this product! My absolute go to. I use it every time  after i wash my hair. I recommend this to everyone i know. You cannot go wrong by trying it. It is non  greasy and smells amazing!!!!,3
5,"It's the only soap we both love. Moisturizes, low scent. When my grocery store quit selling it, I was happy to find we could order it on line! We even take it with us on vacation.",3
5,I bought this for my boyfriend for an early Christmas gift and he absolutely loves it. Great buy and so worth the money.,3
5,Absolutely love this! It's the best brand around --- Will always buy this brand! Fast Shipping too!,3
4,"I like the Bamboo tea, has a very nice taste.",3
4,I really loved my Obag and the shipping was fairly quick...however I did receive one of the handles with a small defect. I love the bag and I don't plan on returning the handles because the defect is small and almost unnoticeable...i will order more pieces from this seller.,3
4,"Quck delivery.  Thank you!  As for benefit of product, it does help my arthritis some.  I'm still evaluating though.",3
5,"Save your brain! Don't use fluoride toothpaste! Hell, 99% of western continental Europe has rejected, banned, or stopped fluoridation due to environmental, health, legal, or ethical concerns... Why won't the US?",3
5,"this is an excellent soap, and the scent is even more wonderful.  I bought a couple extra now to put in my closet and drawers.  I love it.",3
5,"This stuff is as good or better than I expected.I think I like it as much or better than proraso, and taylors of old bond street.it seems to reduce the amount of cuts and scrapes I got with the crap you get in the cans.it smells nice, but not overpowering.my skin feels good after using it.the four soap &#34;pucks&#34; are fairly small but you don't need much to get a good lather working.it'll last maybe a year or more ( I don't shave every day ).good stuff.",3
5,"Great soap!  I wasn't sure about the smell at first, I bought what I thought was the most manly smell, but it's really grown on me. It's slightly astringent so it makes me a little tingly when I use it which was a little disconcerting at first but now I really enjoy it.",3
5.0,This just works amazing! Bright vibrant colours and shippin came earlier than expected :),3
5,"Awesome stuff, the smell lasts all day, I wake up in the morning and<br />Still can smell it.  The shipping was on time like always, Im very pleased<br />With this product",3

5,Love the color,3
5,AWESOME AWESOME.....the CARAMEL IS THE BEST  EVER&#62;  CANT SAY ENOUGH&#62;  DON'T EVER DISCONTINUE&#62;,3
5,I found this product line to be very helpful for fine hair especially in Florida's humidity and water type.  It adds moisture and softness without causing my hair to be dull and greasy.,3
5,"I have used Q-tips since I was a kid. I have a bad left ear, I use for make-up, when I wear it. I've used them for so many things I can't remember them all. I have noticed that the &#34;stick&#34; is not as strong as it used to be. They can bend using them in my ear. I don't need any guff on using in my ear. You don't know the situation. Has nothing to do with seller, they don't make them. I will continue to use them till I can't anymore.",3
5,"smells so good that i want to eat it !!! lol   my skin is really smooth now,i use it each day after shower.    i live in germany ,i cant find this product here so i must order it from amazon.com . i bought all tree hut shea butter sorts ,but i must say ,this one is the best.",3
5,Good,3
5,"I have a typical story to many other reviewers whom have been using cheap discount clippers. Just bought my first set of Oster's Platinum Spirit clippers and they cut my hair like silk!<br /><br />Anyways, this Comb Set fits the Platinum Spirit is metal and spring loaded. The obvious different when comparing to the cheapy sets is the quality. Upon using it, the design and angle where it sits on the top of your head is somehow better too.<br /><br />Bottom line, I'm sticking with Oster brand of clippers!",3
5,Simply love it!,3
5,"These glitter tips are beautiful i love the way they look on me the details are already on them.i just clue them on and i zeal them on with soak off gel. I use three layers and top it off with top gel. Very simple look and put on bling blings and their is one of many designs. You get alot and cheap cost.I own more colors same price and affordable. It came before its time.they look thin,but that's how i liked it to look, natural.",3
5,"Organic Rosehip Oil is a natural moisturizer composed by essential fatty acids, antioxidants and vitamins, which makes it a powerful skin regenerator. Highly recommended as natural remedy , the continious use smooths, improves, prevents and tones wrinkles, dark spots, uneven skin tone, eczema, psoriasis, dry skin, sun burns, insect bites, stretch marks and more. Leaves no oily residue.<br /><br />I am so glad that I had the opportunity to review this product. I have used it for a few weeks now and can really tell a big difference in how my face looks and feels. I will definitely purchase this in the future.<br /><br />I received this product for an honest and unbiased review.",3
4,"I tried this one and got good results. Smooth skin and close shave. Delivered as per my expectations. Now the ingredient part. The cream is loaded with parabens and sls. These chemicals has been debated in scientific community for the harmful effects it may create for humans. So, if you give less importance to the ingredients, then this is for you. If you are very conscious about the ingredients then you may be in for a disappointment. A tricky situation. On one side you get a shave you desired (smooth, close, non itching ....) and on other hand the ingredients makes you feel jittery. I honestly feel that the company should have opted for organic chemicals (like essential oils) to these chemicals. This is my own opinion and yours may differ than mine after you use it. Also note that this is the same cream Proraso but with different label. So 4 stars for the performance and minus 1 star for the ingredients.",3
5,wow  its  great,3
5,"Bare minerals stopped making this eyeliner so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. It is easy to apply and has the smudge tip end. It is easier to apply than the waterproof edition, and I was very sorry to hear they had discontinuing it.",3
5,"Though the name of this polish is silver, it comes out a normal gray creme that requires a sparkle silver topcoat to be called a true silver. That being said, I purchased it as a normal gray and am madly in love with the shade. Application is consistent and easy, and it's opaque in two coats. I would certainly recommend this as a nice fall shade.",3
4,I bought this simply to try it out. I didn't have expectations. I typically use it AM and PM after I've washed my face if I have a blemish. I can say for myself that within 24 hours I definitely see a big difference. If it's a bigger blemish it will take a little longer for the affected area to finally go away and I become slightly dry in that area where it was applied. Overall I think it's an excellent product and I do believe it should not be used with other treatments such as concealers or other cover up's for blemishes. That is most likey the reason why you are not getting rid of your blemish and getting more blemishes! The price isn't bad at all for the amount of product that you get. A little goes a long way! The smell that everyone talks about isn't foul nor is it over powering. It's not roses either! I will buy it again when mine runs out. You can't find anything else out there for the results and money!,3
5,Awesome!!!,3
5,I was very pleased with my purchase.,3
5.0,It was great. Beyond my expectations.,3
5,i absolutely LOVE Beyonce's Heat Perfume!  This was sold to me at a great price! I truly am appreciative of the seller's expediency in getting this product to me,3
4,I don't really know much about the perfume because it was bought as a gift for my brother-in-law that's why I gave it 4 stars.,3
5,Really nice product I recommended,3
5.0,I have always been skeptical about wireless dry/wet trimmers. This product more than exceeded my expectations. It will really do head to toe and meet all your hair cutting needs. The battery powered motor is surprisingly powerful for its size. The different blades do their intended job very well. I can say goodbye to my wired clippers finally.,3

5.0,"this stuff WORKS great.  I am an office pusher for the most part, but do masonry and tile work on the side.  My hands dry out quickly and I get those cracks at end of fingertips which is PAINFUL.  this stuff does not sting when you apply it and w/in two days healing begins and pain is gone",3

5,It's a good product...it was well packaged or it would have made quite a mess.  I've been very pleased with it.,3
5,"This is a superb product, after a matter of weeks my skin is glowing! After the winter my skin became really dry and irritated, and I have quite a few wrinkles creeping in (the age, not the winter), but having used this my skin is hydrated and feels really smooth, no bags under eyes too!<br /><br />My friend recommended this and I haven't been disappointed.<br /><br />I found the negative reviews to be really unhelpful, I'm pretty sure they are fake reviews probably by a competitor as they all have the same sort of scam scare!<br /><br />I highly recommend this product!",3
5,"I purchased and started using this in combination with Botanic Choice Spa Retinol Gel in the one oz. jar about 6 weeks ago.  These two combined have made a huge improvement in my skin. It's overall smoother.  It looks and feels softer.  My pores seem to be smaller and discolorations are evening out.  I have been using it for about a month and a half and I really love it.  I use it 1-2 times per day and it still hasn't run out, so there is a lot in there.  It soaks in to my skin quickly and seems gone.  No stickiness or weird smell, but it's really working. I haven't had something like this combination work so well for my skin ever!",3

5.0,Kills order without fru-fru smell. Used in many hospitals.,3
5,"After not being able to find cartridges for my old Braun I was overjoyed to find this!  It works great, no continuously clicking to get a spark like I had to do with my old Braun either.  I did loose an entire cartridge by not making sure I'd pressed the off button and/or making sure it stayed off, kind of like how you forget to unplug your regular curling iron, so I lost an almost brand new cartridge.  Luckily I'd ordered the four pack refills.  However, I find that the slightly smaller one with the case where I unscrew the cartridge before storing everything away is the one I go to most now so that never happens.  This has no case although I just slip the hot rod into an old eyeglass case and that keeps it out of harms way.  Love both products.",3
4.0,"I've been looking for something to replace WELLA ÉLAN PLUS conditioning setting lotion which has been discontinued; this is the first product that has even begin to compare.  Actually, I might like it better (than WELLA) because it doesn't seem to be as drying and gives the hair a firm foundation for use with a curling iron.  I like that it doesn't feel sticky or cause a quick buildup on my curling iron.  I highly recommend this product.",3
5,The mascara is really great! It does lengthen and separate your lashes even without vibration! It curls my lashes and holds them like that all day long! What's their not to like?:),3
4,I wanted a lip primer to make my lip color bright..... I have natural full lips so I wanted them to stand out and stay moist. This little bitty primer is wonderful...,3

4,Good,3
5,"I have recently been (officially) diagnosed with glaucoma and mild cataract. I was searching for herbal remedy that could help decrease/stabilize my eye pressure and clear up the cataract when I found this. Since this is just a little bottle costing about $10, I gave it a shot. To my surprise, my eyesight became sharper in just two weeks after I started taking the drops orally (I am not doing the eye wash). I have been on it for a month now. Although my cataract still persists (worse in my right eye), I have noticed a decrease in the \\""fogginess\\"" out of my right eye, and everything looks much sharper. I intend to keep using this product and will start doing the eye wash when I'm at home. I highly recommend this product - give it a shot, you have nothing to lose.",3

5,"I love this set of stamping plates. I have yet to find an image that does not come out precise, clear and perfect.",3
4,The smell is amazing,3
4,"I would not recommend this polish to everyone.  It is not a traditional color, but it is different from any other colors I have seen on the market. If you are a nail polish junky like myself then I recommend trying it out.",3
5,Believable quality if you have jet black hair,3
5,"I really like this lotion.  I have very dry skin and most lotion is either too thick or greasy or does not take the dryness away.  But this product is perfect - it's medium weight, easily absorbed and for a woman who has dry skin since I can remember, a good lotion is something I use every day so this is a necessity.  Super product.",3

4.0,good!,3
5,"Love, love, love any and all Mrs. Meyer's soaps, especially Basil, Bluebell, and Rhubarb. Definitely looking forward to trying the new Lilac scent. Her soaps are phenomenal, they clean so very well, leave my hands soft to the touch, and the smell so very wonderful! 5 stars, and I think they are rather reasonable price wise for how much you get. (PS, you don't get the gross old mildew smell with your dishrags using any of Mrs. Meyer's dish soap, that you normally get with Dawn or any other brand. My rags smell clean and fresh, while my poor mom's do not.)",3
5.0,perfect,3
5,Love this stuff but haven't been able to find it locally.  Great price and delivery time.,3
4,"Takes some getting used to but the automatic built in break in period is just about right. If you think you don't need a breakin period for your gums, you can cancel the timed break in of 12 uses.  Very powerful, a little noisy. Brush does a very good job. Brush seems a little soft and not sure it will last 3 months as advertised. But it should be close",3
5,"Love M.A.C.  It has a certain smell and consistency that is just all it's own.  That might sound weird, but whatever.",3
5,Only use this brand .. Very very soft to the skin.. I have very sensitive skin .. Best brushes .. Great prices ..,3

5,JUST WHAT MY DAUGHTERS WANTED,3
5,I bought this exact iron from a mall and it was $250. I absolutely loved it and it has lasted me over 5 years. I decided to get another one for back up. I saw this deal online and it almost seemed too good to be true. I got it in the mail and it is the real deal. It works so great and make your hair feel so soft and healthy. I've used herstyler products for years and I have always gotten great compliments on my long blonde silky hair.,3
5.0,Loved it,3
5,Scent was just as I remembered from High School. I was happy I was able to order this scent online. I thought it was discontinued everywhere.,3

5,"I am very happy with this serum. I find it works well for a day and a night time. It is light, non greasy.",3
5,I always buy the 16oz to use at home and these 2oz to keep in my purse or travel with. The lotion is good quality and you dont have to use much. It keeps a good clean smell for a long time and skin feeling silky. A must have if you love the smell of the beach!,3
5,"I usually don't write reviews but when I was looking for a new machine I didn't really see any reviews that helped me so here goes...<br />This machine is GREAT!!! Works exactly as advertised! That being said I am someone who is learning to cut hair (fades, tapers, combovers, etc.) I am a &#34;rookie&#34; although the quality of the machine and the haircut  you get with it is FANTASTIC this machine cuts hair too quickly for me and if I make a mistake when making a line or erasing a line it is difficult for me to fix it. After four months I have gotten better and I have adjusted to the cutting speed of this machine. All in all this machine is great but not for someone who does not have experience like myself.",3
5,"Wow! be careful, don't use more than a pin drop but very beautiful on. It is a very good product.",3

5,"I actually bought this to replace my previous hair straightener, which is the exact same one. The plate fell out of my old one this year, which was kind of impressive considering I've had it since I was 12 (I'm currently 22 - 10 years!). I used it all throughout 8th grade with a bunch of my other girlfriends too. Then, in high school, I hauled it everywhere between houses with said girlfriends. When I finally moved out to my dorm, I took this straightener everywhere with me. Between all the hauling and abuse the straightener took, it's lasted a hell of a long time. I recommend this straightener to everyone and it's kept my hair pretty fab for years. Plus it's a great curler as well as straightener.",3
5,For a little princess.  It's absolutely perfect.  It has a nice sparkle.  It has a look of quality to it.,3
5,"I love this stuff!.....I was looking for a protein conditioner and this was perfect!. It has all natural ingredients and smells nice! I have relaxed hair and needed a protein that wasn't too harsh, but would do the job.",3
5,Works great,3
5,This REALLY WORKS!!! My son is 5 and sweats like a man lol. He had bad odor from under his arms and I wanted something natural. He wears truly no side affects and absolutely NO ODOR! Love this product,3
4,"I have been using these same combs for years.  They go for about $2.29 per comb at Walmart.  They will last for a while, but they are NOT unbreakable, and usually cost about 2 to 3 times more than they are worth.  This deal give you a package of them for about $1 each.  You cannot do better than this for price and quality.  They are well made, good finish, and comb well most any length or coarseness of hair.  The only problem will be if you have to carry them in your pocket: they are not unbreakable.<br />Good comb, good brand name, well made, and a great deal for the money.  Enjoy.",3
4,All of the Masada bath salts seem to work well for my sore legs.  Just add 1-2 cups to warm/hot bath and soak for 15+ minutes.  Good way to recover from hard workouts.,3
5,I LOVE THIS CREAM.....  I see the difference.. my skin looks vibrant in the morning...,3
5.0,"This review is for the Motherlove Sitz Bath Spray in a 2oz bottle. Not for the loose herb sitz bath supplies.<br /><br />I purchased this for the birth of my third child, and it is the absolute BEST product I've ever used for healing birth tears, scrapes, and soreness. After each birth I've been given assorted sitz bath products...mostly loose herbs or diluted witch hazel. I got so sick of the mess that I purchased Motherlove Sitz Bath Spray on a whim with my normal home birth supplies.<br /><br />Oh my goodness. This is so easy. No mess, doesn't take up a lot of room, and smells fresh and clean (in an herbal way). I used it instead of soaked witch hazel pads or herbal baths. Just spray a little on and viola! Good to go. My third baby is now over a year old, but I still use this same bottle once in a while. It's great for healing almost anything in the nether regions, especially if it involves tears or raw skin. I used it on a baby's bad diaper rash, and it worked as well as Badger Baby Balm, which is my favorite baby product. It helped heal up a toddler's vaginal infection from accidentally wiping the wrong way in 24 hours (along with one warm salt bath). I also imagine that it would be great for pregnancy hemorrhoids, but haven't had a chance to test out that theory.<br /><br />I honestly can't recommend this enough! I wish I'd had it for my first two births as well. When this runs out I'm getting another, even if I'm not pregnant again.<br /><br />EDIT 5/2013: I am now nearing the birth of my fourth, and still love this product. I found out that it actually is good for pregnancy hemorrhoids, and even for sore or raw skin in the nether regions after things get a little too (*ahem*) steamy in the bedroom. With three small kids already, there's no way I'll have time for herbal baths, or even little sitz baths after this baby arrives. I need quick, easy, and effective, and that's exactly what the Sitz Bath Spray provides.",3
4.0,Beautiful transaction! Great product!,3
5,its the second time am buying ferrari black.i just love the fragrance.will buy again.thank you amazon.i am very happy i have it again,3
5,very good,3
5,"This product is great, but the flavor is unique, not bad just different from anything I have tried. One serving does give me all of my Omegas in just an ounce. The price was also great and i got it cheaper than i could anywhere else. The product was also a prime eligible item so i got it delivered with free two day shipping. All in all it was a win.",3
5,Recommended by my Dermatologist. I've been very pleased.,3
5,"I've got a long, course beard that loves to curl at the ends. This amazing product, applied with a just a few drops each morning, really helps to soften my beard and make it more manageable. But I gotta tell you, it's that sweet smell of rosemary that makes this product my favorite beard product.",3
5,"What’s not to like about it!!.The microdermabrasion treatment with derma-crystals, comes in a tub. It has a thick yet liquid like consistency. But every bit of it is made up of very fine crystals. It’s yellow in color and has a very nice pleasant smell. The tub contains 64 gms. The peel activator serum contains lactic acid. This is a natural AHA (Alpha Hydroxy Acid) found in sour milk. AHAs are excellent for anti aging and definitely gives the six benefits, which I mentioned above, that this system promises to do. That’s one of reasons I trusted this system/product would really work.<br /><br />The serum is colorless and syrupy in consistency. It has a fruit like smell. Something like bananas. It’s definitely pleasant. If you are thinking “Oh it’s an acid, it might smell like a chemical”, well no. That’s wrong. It comes in a bottle, containing 59 ml.<br /><br />Here is how it works / Directions to use (as listed on the labels):<br /><br />Step 1 : Apply derma-crystals to clean,dry face (about the size of a quarter). Cover entire face like a mask (avoid the eyethe eye area). Gently massage for 45 seconds to 1 minute.<br /><br />Step 2 : Apply the activator serum onto fingertips adding a thick layer directly over the entire derma-crystal mask. Gently massage for upto 1 minute. Rinse thoroughly with warm water, using a wash cloth for best results.<br /><br />When applying the derma crystals, it feels mildly abrasive. The smell is really pleasant and soothing though. I sometimes take more than amore than a quarter to work on my entire face and neck. I don’t press hard instead I gently spread it. Then, on adding the peel activator serum, it reacts with the derma crystals and dissolves it, along with a layer of your skin. There is a mildly warm sensation. Also, when these two products meet, a white foam is produced. It is a conditioner, released to your skin’s surface. If you wish to, you can add more serum to dissolve the crystals. It’s not harmful or anything. Though they suggest you wash your face with warm water, I did try with regular water at room temperature and the results are just the same. Immediately after using this, they suggest to apply a serum to keep your skin moisturized. I use Olay’s serum from the Total Effects range.<br /><br />If by reading the last paragraph, you are skeptical or scared by the wordsthe words like ‘warm’, ‘white foam’ or ‘dissolve’, let me assure you that it’s gentle!. The warm sensation, on a scale of 1 to 10, is at 1. Just a warm feeling that spreads on your skin. Dissolving a layer of your skin would mean that your skin instantly looks fresher, brighter and feels incredibly smooth because a dull layer of dead skin cells is what was dissolved off.<br /><br />This product is gentle enough to be used twice a week. But you shouldn’t be overzealous and try your luck by using it more times. You might end up irritating your skin. Also this product shouldn’t be used on irritated, damaged or diseased skin (as written on the label). You should never use this along with other exfoliating products or with cleansing devices. Before, first using this on my face, I did a 1 day patch test on my hand. Though lactic acid is good, it’s natural and you can never predict how your skin will react.<br /><br />My skin feels and looks incredibly soft and smooth after using this product. There is a brightness to my skin that is very much noticeable. When my family saw me after some timesome time of being apart, they really noticed the difference.<br /><br />If you are a fair person, I guarantee one thing!. Your skin will be red after using this product. My skin doesn’t turn red usually, because I have a dark skin tone. Yet, on the sides of my nose, I noticed slight redness, during the first three times I used this. But now, it doesn’t turn red anymore.<br /><br />The shipping was fast. Amazon shipped it via Aramex and they delivered right to my door, in UAE. It took 8 days to reach me once I ordered it, which is quite good. So all in all, it’s freaking amazing. I love it and I highly recommend it to all!ys to reach me once I ordered it, which is quite good. So all in all, it’s freaking amazing. I love it and I highly recommend it to all!",3
5,"I have naturally curly hair, which is thick and colored, as well. I have to use something in it or it is just frizzy. A friend gave me the remainder of her product as it didn't work for her hair. It sure works for mine and I have been using it now for a few years. My salon just ran out (and so did I - poor planning on my part!!) so I have to wait on it to come in. In the meantime I have used 3 other products (so far) and am not getting the results I want. Curly Cue is not sticky and doesn't feel heavy in your hair or weigh it down but gives me the control that I need. Obviously it isn't going to work for everyone's hair as I inherited it from someone. All I can say is it works for me and gives me the results that I want. I love it!",3
5.0,Im very happy with this item,3
5,Bigger than I thought it was going to be! A large amount of makeup can fit in it and the slots are a good size. A great buy for the price.,3

4,"I am new to the curling wand world.  I bought one for me and sent one to my daughter.  My daughter says. Hers works great. She has thick straight hair about a little past her shoulders.  As for me on the other hand. My hair is straight , thick and the length is a little past my waist. My hair is not layered.  My hair has always been hard to curl.  Even perms won't stay in my hair. With the wand I do get great curls, but can't get them to stay all day even with hair spray.  That's way the 4 stars.  The wand does get very hot.  I read around 410 degrees, there is only an on off switch no temp control button.  I use the glove and would recommend using it, because it's easy to get burned.  I think I just need to practice more with my wand.",3
5,Love my brushes!,3
4,My order arrived quickly and so far I am very pleased. The colors are just beautiful! I think that my 16 year old will just love this assortment of colors. I also purchased the nail stand from Amazon for her nail colors to go on. I can't wait to see my daughters face!,3
4,"I think of the best fragrances as being rich with overtones and undertones, without being overwhelming -- especially to those around you!  I'm fond of L'air du Temp floral tones, but wanted something softer yet with depth of scent.  It is lovely and not overpowering when going on the skin (which that, in itself is rare), fades into rich mid-tones, and finally a floral-woodsy note that stays a long time.  It also doesn't burn my nose the way some fragrances do.",3
5,"I purchased this bag quite a while ago, and it is still holding up!  The pattern was cute, and I am going to order another one soon.  Excellent for the price.",3
5,Super happy great deal i just could not pass this up for a X Mas present for my dad perfect.,3
5,"Sunscreen application is usually a battle with my 3 year old with sensitive skin. This is the only sunscreen I have found that doesn't cause skin flare ups, tears and I don't have to make from scratch. Amazing!",3
5,I have used this product ever since it was marketed and it has never failed me.  It is the only product that works on my type of hair.  I would recommend it to anyone that has body problems with their hair!,3
4,"There really isn't much like shaving your face with a brand new razor. It feels so nice. Unfortunately, these razors are very expensive, and I have looked into Dollar Shave Club as an alternative. I may go in that direction next time, but for this time I utilized my subscribe + save account to couple these with some other items to attain a discount. It didn't hurt the wallet quite as bad that way, and now I get to use a fresh blades for a while to shave with.",3
5,"My dentist has been pestering me for several years to get one of these.  I finally broke down and bought a cheaper (non-Sonicare) model and while that brush did seem to reduce the amount of tartar/plaque that built up between cleanings, it wasn't nearly as effective as this one.  Guess you really do get what you pay for....",3
4,Good,3
5,"My wife ordered these and uses them every night.  I asked her if she felt they were too small as others mentioned and she said no.  She is a small person and actually said they were a bit loose.  You will have to decide on that part,  but for what they are intended to be use for they are great.",3
5.0,"I received a trial size bottle in my Infuenster Latina Beauty Box, but all opinions are my own.<br /><br />I am always on the lookout for a great new sunscreen as I live in South Texas, which is sunny all the time. With it being that way I have to be even more careful and take care of my skin. I hadn't really tried Hawaiian Tropics products before as I thought they were more for tanning. I don't need to tan, I need to keep from being burned. So was excited to try this out as I had already heard some good reviews. It has a great smell, is non greasy, and left my skin feeling silky smooth. It kept me from burning while out in the garden and I didn't have to reapply for hours. This is a great product and I really recommend it!",3
5,I love it!!!!! Will be repurchasing!!!!!!,3
5,the product is great,3

5,"This is the best smelling and moisturizing bubble bath I have ever tried.  Unfortunately, BBW is no longer selling this product.  They do however still carry the body lotion, body butter, hand lotion, spray mist and shower cream and they are all awesome and available at BBW.  Don't waste your time or money buying these products from ebay sellers, they are cheaper and authentic at BBW.",3
5,"I like it fits awesome and is very comfortable<br /><br />5 star because fast delivery, perfect fit, i would recommend it to those trying to get wave only problem is it looks nothing like the what's on the package. it really is just a stocking atleast that's what i received.",3
4,I bought this mirror for putting on eye make up and it is everything that I hoped it would be,3
5,"I have been using it over half year for now and I must say it made wonders to my facial skin. I had extremely dry skin and I started going to dermatologist. I used Cerave as per my doc's suggestion and it was nice when ever I applied it. But if I don't apply it 2 times a day, my skin again turns dry. I used to buy 2 Cerave tubes a month worth 70 dollars each. But Somehow I was not happy as my dry skin is not repaired. Then, on friend's suggestion I tried this cream and I must say with in a week, my dry skin problem is cured. It really worked well and repaired my dry skin. I would highly recommend this creme for dry skinned people like me. I might sound little exaggerative, but the truth is, I stopped visiting my derma doc and started using this creme.<br /><br />Review by Hema",3
5,"I have sensitive skin and have to be careful of the products I use, this moisturizer is wonderful it leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft without irritating it,",3
5,awesome i like the fragance,3
4,good,3
5,I've re-ordered these blades several times. I find they cut super close and they don't snag or cause much (if any) razor burn.,3
4,"Why this item is awesome...<br />-It's color really stands out<br />-The clip makes it easy to put in and take out<br />-When you get it, it's very long, so it would fit almost anyone's hair<br /><br />It's Downers...<br />-The end of the extension gets really rough and tangled<br />-The string attaching the extension to the clip brakes easily<br />-The clip sometimes slides down your hair, if your hair is very fine or smooth",3
5,"these clippers are amazing.  they get a little warm if you use them for an extended period of time. (more than an hour) so possibly not for the barber, but perfect to cut your own hair or clean up a few heads before the weekend begins...",3
4,"I've seen this given a few bad reviews but fail to see any real faults. It has a distinctly different (yes, kinda soapy) fragrance and can be overpowering in smaller spaces. Overall I find it pleasant but still prefer Nag Champa and it's sisters.    I bought the smaller, 50-stick package because I had not experienced this particular brand before. It's not exactly my cup of tea but considering the price I could get used to it.    I have not noticed the \\""burning plastic\\"" smell mentioned in other reviews.",3
5,This clipper is professional barber sharp. It's compact size allows you to take command of it and maneuver in a way that yields sharp lines.,3
5,I use it for my hair and use it in my mixture and It is a very very good product.,3
5,"This item is amazing! I used it very successfully with my first pregnancy and am investing in it again with my second pregnancy. I tried several different products with my first pregnancy and this one was by far the best. The smell is great and the moisture benefits are out of this world! It keeps my belly itch free, moisturized, and free of stretch marks the entire pregnancy. I am very short waisted so baby can only grow out. My belly gets huge, but stayed in perfect shape so that a few weeks post partum, the firming aspect of this product had my stomach looking just as it did pre-baby. Try it, you'll love it! The oil is great, too.",3
5,"Wow, I love this little gadget! It is better than I expected. I really feel like my skin is smoother. I am very pleasantly surprised. I recommend it.",3
5,The product is very smooth. Makes my hair feel very soft. I have tried many products before and never experienced the same results. Absolutely recommend.,3
5,I have searched almost every store I could find and larger tounge scrapers are not available in any!!!! It's like they disappeared so I had to order them online and I'm going to buy in bulk =o),3
5,This is my go-to foundation and has been since I first tried it. The coverage is good without being overdone.,3
4,"Got this for my tragus piercing and it is super cute and adorable.  Also I like it much better than my circular ball end because I can actually tell if it is spinning.  I don't change that piercing ever (I've only worn two others in the past three years) but this was definitely worth it! Would buy again if ever lost or ruined, however its been over a month and has still lasted.",3
5,This product is amazing and was received in amazing condition i would rate it 10 stars if i could<br />It is very hard to find a moisturizer for my skin type (combination dry/oily) but this is the PERFECT moisturizer.<br />Dry skin will be gone and your skin will seem supple and fresh all day,3
5,"Love the smell, and easy to incorporate into my face lotion recipie",3
5,thank you,3
5.0,My daughter absolutely LOVES this!,3
5,They work best if you put these new blades in the original holders that came with the razor. For some reason they make a grinding noise in the new holders and try to spin the whole thing. But in the original holders they work smooth or at least they do for me and I've used these before and just tossed the new holders.<br /><br />Revise: This last set of blades lasted for almost 2 years. I just ordered and received a new set and installed them. They still make a noise with the blade holders that they came in but when I put them in the original holders they're as smooth as they were when I purchased the razor new.<br /><br />Revised: The last set I order lasted one year and eleven months just like the last set. I continue putting the new blades in the old holders and they work just fine.,3
4,Love this stuff & at 54 it work!!! I've seen a big difference. Plan on getting more...i got it at a great price too.,3
5.0,"I have wanted a T3 Hair Dryer for several years after watching presentations on infomercials.  My hands don't function well and holding a blow dryer up to dry my short but difficult to dry hair has been a challenge for years.  I finally decided to shop around and get myself one.  I am very happy with the diffusers and how quickly my hair dries using the dryer, however I would like it if it folded for travel.  That doesn't detract from my enjoyment and less pain in my hands having this new product to use.",3
5,"My son loved the design, packaging, and smell of these colognes they were an awesome gift, I received them ahead of time and in excellent condition.<br />I would definitely order from your company again.<br />Thanks again for such wonderful service.",3
5,It is wonderful and makes my hair feel clean but not heavy or dry.  Seems to be less harsh as well.,3
5,"I had this for over 2 weeks so far so good. It came in like 2 days from the time I ordered it. It came packaged very well. I ordered the 1lb size just to try it. It had the shea butter scent. It was the color that is advertised and it was kind of soft. I mixed this to make a hair butter with oils. I also made a skin butter and mixed it with different oils as well. It didn't have any foreign particles in it. I whipped mine so that got rid of the grains but it melts so good in warm hands so that wasn't even an issue. My skin and hair loves it so will order some once my stash gets low. A little goes a long way. I will order from this same company again because today they sent a 25% coupon code as a \\""Thank You\\"" for purchasing their product. I feel that is good business but I won't be using the code because you have only 72hrs to use it and I don't need anymore at this time... Just the idea of them sending me that is awesome!!! I got mine from Top Shelf Barber Supplies. :)",3
5,"I'm a fan of lemons, love lemony smell of products. I so love the scent of the cuticle cream. I've rubbed this onto nails around before bed. It did work on dry nail.",3

5,This is one of the most waranty products I ever try.<br />I highly recommended this product to every one.<br />I got it on time. The customer services was excelent and on time,3
5,Love the scent! Makes my fine thin hair look and feel great. I have actually received a couple comments! yea,3
5,I love this color. I've been using it for years to brighten up my hair color. I get lots of compliments and comments – even natural redheads think I'm a &#34;ginger&#34; :-),3
4,I am not sure it has the acne clearing benefits it claims. It works just fine for me but my skin is the same as it was before I started using it a couple of months ago.,3
5,"I used Joico's KPak products for a long time, but I wasn't in love with them because they didn't provide much moisture, and I kind of hated the tutti frutti scent of the line. Then I tried the Moisture Recovery products and fell in love. This stuff is great on my \\""blow fried\\"" curly hair, it feels smooth, I can get a comb through it without pulling too hard and it's soft and shiny without being weighed down. And it smells so nice (a sweet floral, maybe hyacinth?)! I alternate the Moisture Recovery Treatment Balm with the Moisture Recovery Conditioner. My only wishes would be that they make the shampoo sulfate-free and make a hairspray with the same fabulous fragrance!",3
5,fast delivery..quality product!!!,3
5,"nothing like a classic a man,s sent",3
4,"As a teacher, hand sanitizer and constant hand washing at work was getting my hands super dry. I was ordering other nail tek products at the time so decided to try this. A little goes a long way, and it was very light and dried quickly. I'm not so sure about the re-activation with water, but maybe it was because I wash my hands so often.",3
5,"This is a refill for the Fusion Proglide Power razor, wich is best razor I ever used and I'm pleased to choose this poduct. I recommend for everyone.",3
5.0,I bought this for my boyfriend for Father's Day and he loves it.  He's always said its more convenient to shave in the shower than at the sink but he never took the time to find a fogless mirror for the shower.  He's complimented it each time he's used it.,3
4.0,"Nice smelling moisturizer, but still feel a burning sensation in the hot weather despite the Spf30!",3
5,"I will buy it again, it makes your hair really full, excellent product, I recommend it, I will try other products  from Frieda",3
5,Well pleased,3
4,Love this mascara! It does seem to clump in the bottle faster than other brands but that's okay with me since the ingredients are more natural in this brand,3
4,"It's good for moisturizing your skin but I didn't care for scent. Smelled like geraniums to me,could have a tropical scent.",3
4,"This soap always reminds me of my youth when a little boyfriend traveled to Spain and brought me back this soap. However, it does not smell quite the same anymore, it's more spicy rather than floral. But I still like the olive color and the fact that it brings me back to my youth....",3
5,One of my favorite perfumes at a great price.,3
4,"So I really do like this product but it does have a not so attractive scent. Therefore I mix it with rose oil to make it smell pretty or after I use this oil I spray rose water in my hair to neutralize the odor. My hair quickly absorbs it, leaves my hair wavy....I have wavy hair and argan oil leaves my hair stick straight I hate that!",3
5,"Finally replaced the 40-year-old Norelco.  This one's even better. Closer shave, quiet, lightweight.  He's good for another 40 years.",3
5,Purple is my favorite color and this one looks great! Love gelish! It lasts so long! A good few weeks on my nails and two months on my toes. The only problem is once it grows out it does start to peel and sometimes my hair gets caught in the edges. But compared to regular polish it is wonderful. Will never go back to regular after using gel.,3
5,"Great product I must say. Leaves skin feeling hydrated, moisturized, and fresh. It smells really good as well.",3
5,"When I bought the Clarisonic, I had heard that a lot of users had troubles with the cleansers. As someone with sensitive skin, I expected to use my own cleanser with this, but I tried it to see how it went. I loved it! It seems like this is made to go with the Clarisonic, and I did not have any issues with breaking out (which I fully expected) or other problems. I only use this and the Clarisonic once per day (evenings), but I love it and will continue to pair them together.",3
5,This is a great moisturizer for my hair and scalp.  Very light and smells great!,3
5,great to set brow pencil and create hombre effect,3
4,"I agree with the reviewer who commented about the clumping after a month. I experienced the same thing until I cleaned the brush. It worked great after that.<br /><br />Here's why I love this mascara:<br />1. Truly sweat proof, which is the reason I bought it in the first place. After 2 hours at the gym, no raccoon eyes and no clumps of mascara in my contacts.<br />2. It lasts for two, sometimes three days. It seems to fade out instead of clumping and falling on my pillow.<br />3. The color is subtle enough that I get color and length but don't look like I have false lashes. I wanted something that would look natural, like I wasn't even wearing mascara.<br />4. It comes off easily with eye make up remover.<br /><br />The only reason it's not a five star because I wish the price was lower. Otherwise, it's a great purchase. It beats all the other \\""waterproof\\"" mascaras you'll buy at the drugstore. Guarranteed!",3
4,"I don't care if they're only half way filled up because they still seem to look wonderful! I think if the color rubs off it means you're not handling it with care, you're supposed to DIP your nail in and I think that makes the color stay. But it looks very enjoyable in the picture and so soon I will buy it! I saw the picture of containers while they were advertising it and the containers were filled up half way, so, I think it shows you how much they're filled. Overall I've put my opinion on it, four stars!",3
5,Great product,3
4,"I bought this for my daughter's wedding, which hasn't happened yet, so I don't know if this will work for her hair... but it is very pretty.",3
5,"This is fantastic stuff. Once again, St. Ives shows you how to look like a goddess without spending much.  The pleasant fragrance will leave you wondering..... what did I put on.... and then you remember......my gosh.... It's the Renewing Polish.   Try it.... you'll be addicted..... I bought 3 jars.... gave two to my neighbors.... they are now fans.",3
4,for the price i was expecting them to be smaller but they are great size and they are very nice colors.,3

5,Love the product.,3
5,Perfect!!!! I have very long hair and for years have worn it in a bun. Now trying to wear it down and this clip is perfect.,3
5,I can't say how many hair styling products I've tried over the years.  This one holds up through the day.  It doesn't make me look greasy.  It doesn't flake off.  It is great.  I just wish it came in larger quantities.,3
5,"This is the best sulfur soap I have used so far, it's gentle on my aggravated dry skin and not overly perfumed. Occasionally you get a whif of the eggy sulfur but it's not bad at all. This soap has really helped to calm the red itchy skin on my legs and arms.",3
4,picks are great. The lid on the 275 pick container is very difficult to operate.,3
5,Looks much nicer in person.  It has some weight to it.  Doesn't feel as cheaply made as some other McQueen look alines.,3
5,"My mom loves anything with this scent, body lotion, body wash, but especially the powder. It's great to find it here when C&E is sold out.",3
5,Accuracy. Free sharpening at tweezerman,3
5.0,"About what I expected, it took about a month to order. For the price they're ok. It's just one piece so if you're adding color underneath your hair they are perfect, if you are extending your natural hair you may want to order two or three. It wasn't the color ordered, but I didn't mind much.",3
5,"I have been using this facial cleanser for years and it really works! It is great for skin that is not so young anymore, yet still suffers from some acne. It is also a very gentle cleanser. Does not leave my face feeling dry, just clean and moist.",3
5,I was very excited when i saw that they had changed up the Gillette fusion as i have always wanted a closer shave with a manual razor but have always been disappointed. I received my proglid from Gillette as a sample to test out and i couldn't have been happier. Not only is the shave closure but the track ball design helps me eliminate nics and leaves my face feeling kiss ably smooth or so my wife says. I have since purchased the item and will continue to as long as they keep making this great razor.,3
5,I don't have to shave much but more of bought this to stimulate my hair before shaving and I thoroughly enjoy it.,3
5,I'm not blessed with flawless skin but this has proven to be the best I've tried in masking the unevenness of in tone(s).,3
5,This shampoo really reduces hair loss.Of course it doesn't stop it completely. Because to stop hair loss completely you need to treat the reason of it.<br />It makes my scalp feel so good. It is free of SLS and other harsh chemicals so  it is one of the rear shampoos that I can use every day.,3
4,"I use this during the summer everyday. You never know when you are going to go to the beach, Lake house, or being swimming in a pool during the summer months!",3
5,AMAZING COVERAGE. great verity of colors &' amazing coverage. I love this product. I really recommend this product!! Buy it,3
4,It took a bit to receive but it was packaged very nice.,3
5,"Because of my training I have some knowledge of skin care and this is the best hydrating gel I have found. It leaves my soon-to-be-50 skin soft, hydrated, and supple. The ingrdients are exactly the same and in the same amounts as the Skincentuals product but costs less than half! It is a light, fast asorbing serum with no fragrence to irritate sensitive skin. Do yourself a favor and try this if you need a good hydrating moisturizer.",3
4,Works better (if only slightly) than any of the other cheaper ones I have used. However it does work and am happy when I use it every so often.,3
4,Smaller than I thought,3
5,"Love love this stuff!!<br />I had to stop using tingle because I couldn't touch my kids or they would whelp up.<br />The melt is awesome, and gives off the tingle affect without actually making you tingle!!<br />Love it!!",3
5,They are lovely and soft! They look just like it's pictured on here. Good quality brushes too! You should buy this :),3
5,"The product is lightweight, the cord swivels, and there is an adjustable temperature dial. What more could I ask for?",3
5,"As always Braun makes the best tooth brushes ever. This is my third toothbrush in 20 years. All of them lasted many years. The speed is just right, it displays the usage of the battery and slows down every 30 seconds to show how much time you are brushing your teeth. The clock also shows the brushing time. The only complain I have is when you reach 2 minutes it stops completely for about 1 or 2 seconds and then starts again. I would prefer if it just slowed down as it does every 30 seconds. Other then that I love it!",3
5,I love this product.  It seems to work and the shipping was timely.,3
5,exactly what we were looking for but I would recommend buying better ink....eternal is the best the ink in the kit not so good,3
5.0,Nice,3
5,Had to cover my forearm tat for my new job..works perfect!,3
5.0,great product,3
4,"I have acne prone skin and its very oily. I began using this cleanser as an alternative from all of the other chemically filled cleansers out there. Previously, I would use proactive face wash and at times I would switch between other products such as Neutragena and Clarassil.<br /><br />I didn't had any dramatic changes to my skin while using this product. I didn't break out more or less, it was pretty normal just like the other face washes I used in the past. The two positive things with this product were that it was all natural so no matter what, I was not putting bad chemicals on my face and two was that it smelled great. I almost wanted to taste it, but I don't care how natural they say it is, I will not be eating beauty products lol.<br /><br />I would recommend it because I didn't had any negative experience with it. It did last me a long time, too. It is a bit pricy because its all natural, but I feel like natural stuff should be cheaper. Maybe everyone would switch to natural appose to having to grave the chemically infested ones.<br /><br />I only used it once and now I'm back to pro-active because its shown me that it works a lot better at keeping my skin under control. Like I said Green Beaver never made me break out more but it also didn't diminish my breakouts. Proactive seems to be the only one that actually keeps my skin under control.",3
5,Absolutely loved the oil.....I Live in the desert...which dries my skin immensely....this is the only oil that has kept my skin wonderfully soft.,3
5,"This eye mask is comfortable and blocks out almost all light.  Works as expected and seems durable.  Haven't tried any other masks to compare, but doubt I will need to.",3
5,A sweet 16 gift from mommy to her little princess and she loves it and of course I sneak a few squirts here & there & mommy loves it too!!!! Plenty of compliments on the lovely scent...,3
5,"Took a day to put up because silicone needs to adhere to wall but then you will have no problem with it slipping from the wall like many others we had that were held up just with rubber stoppers on back.  Used 1st time this morning and was excellent, clear and love squeegy that comes with unit.  Would recommend to anyone, also bought one for our condo at the beach!!",3
5.0,I get many compliments from strangers about my skin. I have been using it for over a year.,3
5,Product just as described and works perfectly!,3
4.0,"As other have mentioned, use this for the light and the top coat!<br />It's been marked down super cheap here and in stores because they're replacing this with a much more expensive kit. This is an affordable at home gel manicure starter kit: get it!<br />I have the strips and they're cute to use from time to time, especially the patterned ones that I could never recreate on my nails otherwise, but really the gold in this kit is the light and the top coat.<br />I love doing my nails myself, I also love the durability and look of gel nails. This is perfect for me. I have tried using both gel and regular polishes for the color and each have worked great.<br />I haven't had a manicure last two weeks, but that's mostly because I have a bad habit of peeling off my polish. I've seen these last 10 days without chips though, and at the price it is at now I think is super worth it.<br />I've also paired these with the Broadway Nails tips kit. The tips are high quality but the gel + activator in that is basically garbage. Those tips plus this top coat has been my prettiest manicure ever.",3
5,I have a lot of hair and it's naturally wavy.  This product makes my hair feel great. It is super soft and shiny. Reduces the blow drying time.,3
4,"great item. Fast shipping, This is not lightweight and cheap. A bit longer than I thought but love it still. Will buy again!!",3
5,Excellent,3
5,"This is my daughter's favorite perfume, made in France from violets, impossible to find in stores, and rare on the internet.  I hadn't been able to find a single source for it on the internet for nearly a year. I was ectatic when I found it on Amazon, and decided to surprise her with one of those wonderful little brown boxes everyone loves.  It was a beautiful package, and it arrrived very quickly, even though she lives in another state.  I was totally surprised when she called and squealed \\""Thank you, thank you, thank you!!\\""",3
5,I bought this for my cerave moisturizer in the tub.  It fits perfectly and the pump moves to &#34;open&#34; and &#34;close&#34; the pump.  love it.,3
4,"Humm so far so great. I bought this for my hair, but for the price I actually didn't want to like it cause I have a lot of hair and would have to buy this expensive stuff often if it worked. So I decided to try it on my face - and I really like it so far. My skin is terribly dry due to Chicago's winter and this stuff is great and it's also evening out my skin tone. Due to my acne flair ups I was initially afraid of it, but no breakouts so far! I use Moroccan brand Argan oil for my hair, but its not all natural so I wanted to try Josie, I did try it on my hair after all since I loved it on my face, but I didn't like it much for my dry hair, it was still dry. At least my face looks fab!",3
5,This iron is so nice. Definitely a luxery iron. I've had some cheap ones and this is so different. Easy to use and looks like I went to salon. Love that!,3
5,"The HSI 1 inch straightener is overall awesome and for the price too! I was surprised that it even came with the hand glove, a storage pouch and a small bottle of argan oil. The straightener does great for my hair. I have thick and long hair and when I used the straightener, it completely softened my hair and was straight as ever. Better than other straighteners I've used. Doesn't seem to kill my hair either. I just hope it lasts forever. So don't waste your money on those expensive straighteners, just get the HSI!",3
4,Sure brings back memories of the way my dad shaved...love it..now to get mug and brush.Can't beat the cost...Thanks<br />Highly recommended,3
4,"This scent is so sophisticated and sharp. I first smelled in in a department store and fell in love. But I'm still not certain it mixes well with my body chemistry. I'm waiting for hot weather this summer to find out. It really is a gorgeous, complicated perfume, so I hope it works well for me.",3
5,"PERFECT! This came BEFORE time! I was nervous & emailed the company & they responded promptly to my emails. Came as color shown in picture. It is a light brown with a red-ish tint, that's the best way to describe it. In the light it is a really pretty copper color. A bit shiny but not bad at all! Mine was perfect, no tangles and only 2-3 loose hairs that came out when running my fingers through. Came WITH a free wig cap and a net over the wig to keep in tidy. Has two hooks inside but i have no idea how to hook them to tighten! BUT youtube has a video for everything so after i write this i will head on over and learn how to adjust it. Sounds like a mixed bag when getting these but i am VERY SATISFIED with my order. Not much curl to it but i will rag roll it carefully & know it will look great! I think i will trim the bangs but they did look cute when i pinned them back. Now i have something to put on when my hubby wants me to ride to town with him and i feel a bit lazy! GREAT! I WILL BUY MOORE from this seller! Thank you!",3
5,I bought this product a few weeks ago and have been using it nightly since.  I actually look forward to putting it on because it goes on so smoothly and blends in quickly.  It does make me feel pampered.  My skin is looking better already.,3
5,"Absolutely love this Gel, from day one I had no problems with it, it never flaked, nor was it crunchy, it leaves the hair soft and last for many days, I usually co-wash once a week, sometimes I go longer, but my hair is long and it's a lot of work, this gel has made my life a lot easier, I do leave some conditioner on my hair after I co-wash it, I found this works really good with the gel, some people use leave in conditioner, but I use tea tree tingle conditioner.  I will use this product forever, thanks to the makers.",3
5,LOVE IT,3
5,I love this brand of lip color and have used it for many years!,3
5,"I agree that these slippers aren't for walking, but warm them and slip them on feet that are always cold. They are like walking on warm beach sand, or any type of materal. I ordered another pair for my brother in-law, his feet are always cold too. Sit or lying down they are perfect!",3
5,"I love this product.  It leaves your hair super shiny, super soft and the smells amazing.  Very easy to comb your hair after.",3
5,"This brand has always exceeded the quality of other brands, including store brands. Have using for over 60 years & find this one holds it's shape better than the others.",3
5,"I ordered this eye shadow in Kentucky, and was really happy with it.  It has a wonderful shimmer to it, but its not overly glittery which is great.  And it doesn't go on really thick, but not too sheer either.  Its great for most occasions but I would not recommend this if your looking for a matte eye shadow.",3
4,"Ok first I would like to say that I went on YouTube to see this product in action. I was the ionic version of this one, not this actual product. Everyone's hair came out so nice. I wanted Victoria Secret bouncing curls...no curling iron trick did it.  I emailed Sarah Victor ( on YouTube) and asked her if she would still recommend the Caruso system..she said. Yes.  I decided to go with the smaller one. Because of space.<br /><br />I have naturally curly hair..  I tried this on my dry. Not so straighten hair...20 minutes. Later. Bouncing curls!!!  I cold shot blowed dried the curlers.<br /><br />Ok my friend has slippery fine hair..  I tried this on her. And her hair was slightly Damp when I took out the rollers, the curls didn't  come out as bouncy.  It was more like waves.<br /><br />And another girl has thick Smooth Hair. And. She got the Bounce too!  Only, I ran out of the medium and small rollers, those are the trick to the curls. In my experience.  The big curlers smooth the hair.",3
5,"Aura Cacia Essential Oil in Tangerine provides a cheerful and uplifting smell that will provide you with an aromatherapy experience like none other. Just add a few drops of oil to your favorite lotion, massage oil or aromatherapy diffuser to enjoy the smell.<br /><br />It is not recommended for direct use on the skin. I have enjoyed using it in a vanilla lotion and also in my dish and hand soap near my kitchen sink. It adds a fresh smell to my tedious dish washing process and I really enjoy the smell.<br /><br />It reminds me of a orange grove in Florida.",3
5.0,"smells great , works great",3
5,This product is the best body balm to put on dry skin.  Love It!  I hope they never stop carrying this product.,3
5,Still a great soap after 2 years of use. Any one can use it and works esp. well on those with acne like my daughter has.,3
4.0,"I like this product.  It doesn't dry my skin out, and leaves a distinct fragrance on it.  Not unpleasant, floral with almost musky undertones.  A little goes a long way, too, which helps make up for the cost.",3
5,"at first cream was difficult to wash off , so i recommend you use something really brisk to scrub it off , but overall it leaves youre skin feeling smooth and it does work , i say give it a few days 5 max and u will see results .",3
5,Works very well.  Wish I had found something like this so many years ago to keep my gums and Chicklets clean and healthy.,3
5,This is simply the best nail clipper money can buy.. I have used it for months and am impressed at how silky smooth it operates and leaves nails so cleanly cut no filing is required. Nothing compares not even the more expensive clippers can touch this..,3
5,"Excellent product, I recommend it 100%, very useful. Is a bit small but it does its job, I like it",3
4,I used the product for the second time.  The mask hardens and I can really feel a tightening effect.  I am happy with the results so far.,3
5,"my hairdresser turned me on to this stuff, at a whole lot more $$ - great to find it on amazon. quick delivery, much better price, great product. cuts down the need for a curl lotion and moroccan oil as separate items. when it is really damp out i do add a little oil to this product, but i only need a bit and this product lasts a long time.",3
5,Good price,3
5,Excellent !,3
5,The smell is really good can't stop useing it favorite smell I will buy more bet it don't last all day bout 2 hours,3
5,Very good product!  Bulbs were sorta hard to get in at first but I'm very happy with it.,3
5,"I love this HerStyler hair straightener.  I have very curly hair, and have two daughters, one of them with very curly hair and we all agree this is the best hair straightener we've ever used.  I bought them one each for xmas and they both say it is the best present they received.  And the price!  Who can beat it?  I purchased my first HerStyler several years ago at a mall and paid 4 times what I paid on Amazon.  The ceramic plates chipped - but I must admit to dropping the thing regularly.  I never did bother to return it, I was happy to be able to buy another one at such a fantastic price.  This is a really good deal and a good product - don't drop it!",3
5,"My wife has found a new friend in Tom Ford after years of being a Chanel girl. I think this smells pretty good too, but in the end if she's happy, I'm happy, and since she's happy I give this 5 stars.",3
5.0,love the color,3
5,"If you have sensitive skin and have problems with perms burning your skin you might want to try this one. It's the only perm I've found that I don't have problems with, and it curls beautifully and lasts a long time. Don't confuse this one with the Ogilvie Home Perm / The Original. The boxes look similar but they aren't the same thing. The one I like is the one with the heat activator you mix with the waving lotion, the other one you don't have to mix. I accidentally bought the other one once and it burned my skin like any other perm, and I wasn't as happy with the curls, either.",3
5,"I have been a long time Sonicare user.  Years ago my dentist recommended Sonicare and I have been a faithful user of them, upgrading when new models came along.  My dental visits have reflected that use.    My hygienist prefers Oral-B and we have talked about it over the years.  I wasn't persuaded.  Recently Oral-B started a 50% off campaign and with their 60 day return policy I thought I would try them out.    I am glad I did.  I very much like this toothbrush and how it works.  It is bigger than my Sonicare Flex, but even so it feels very good in my hand.  I love the smart timer.  While the Sonicare gives you a beep/jar every 30 seconds, you can see your progress with the Oral-B on the timer.  The Oral-B also gives you a jar too.  In fact, this is the one thing I don't like about it.  It is too much of a jar, especially at the 2 minute mark.  It is as if your car is about to stall.      After two minutes the Sonicare shuts off.  The Oral-B keeps going until you shut it off.  I am finding that I keep on using it for another 30 to 60 seconds.  Now you can select a deep clean cycle of 3 minutes rather than the normal 2 minute cycle, but I find I prefer going through the normal cycle and then concentrating on the areas my dentist has mentioned as needing extra attention for another 30/60 seconds.    The brushes seem to be fine.  I have used the ones that came with the package but also the sensitive head.  I like the sensitive head best.  It is a bit more compact and seems to get the job done.    I will know how effective it is for me when I next visit the dentist for a cleaning.    But for now, my feeling is that I am doing a better job in brushing and concentrating on the problem areas.    I am keeping this and sending in for the rebate.",3
5,This soap lathers better than any soap I've ever used & lasts longer too. This scent is nice & mild. I kinda wish it was a bit stronger. But it's all good. I highly recommend it.,3
5.0,"In a perfect condition, arrived without any delays, without any dangers and the item was as described and show on pics. Very satisfied, I recommend this seller and this product.",3
5,"We love Bumble and Bumble products. We use the Seaweed Shampoo and the Seaweed Conditioner. This is their styling lotion product. The scent is very nice and it gives a nice, silky sheen.",3
5,"It is totally worth the price, I thought it would be bigger, but it is pretty small. It feels very refreshing to the skin.",3
4,"[[ASIN:B000GCIB6W ProFoot Vita-Gel Corn Wraps, 3 ct.]] I like these. They are much quicker to apply than tape and do the job better than many other approaches, they fit nicely, clean up with hand soap. However a pack of 10 would be probably more efficient",3
5,"I hadn't tried on any other veils, so I didn't have much to compare it to. But for the price it is excellent! I am very happy with my purchase.",3
5,I used this mask for a couple of year. My friend name it Cinderella mask. You look great and fresh.,3
5,"These definitely give you more length and fullness. You can totally see a difference (see my picture: left vs. right eye). I curl mine first, then follow the directions. They can get slightly clumpy, but not like tarantula legs or anything....be careful when applying the extensions as the fibers can dust into your eyes...",3
5,Love this tank!! For the price I spent can't beat it ... Going in my suitcase for my trip love it,3
5,Have yet to find a man that can resist the sweet smell of this. One of my all time favorites.,3
5,perfecta,3
5,This is my second order - I have even used this on my face and arms. It absorbs very quickly and the coconut smell reminds me of the beach!,3
5,got the half oz bottle like I do most colors to test before I buy a a bigger bottle and add it to the color pallette or keep a 1/2 oz for every so often. Im adding this one in a 4 oz its bright and flows easy and easily mixable with other colors. Also blends well.,3
5,This Vitamin C Eye Gel was a steal & AMAZING quality. :-) A+++ for anyone who wants this product too.,3
5,"I have only used Lip Ink for the last 4 years. I use Shine as a base, and combine Rust and Mango Lip Inks for the perfect shade and top off with another coat of shine for gloss. It truly last for hours and doesn't transfer...even when kissing! The Shine gloss keeps my lips from getting dry.",3
5.0,Best perfume ever!!,3
5,"I have had a Mirena IUD for almost 3 years, after the first year my face at 28years old had a immense amount of adult acne on it and I have kids so I have had bags under my eyes and now I am almost 30, I also see laugh lines developing near my mouth. I stopped using my Rx face cream when I got this product to see if it would have a different effect without the Rx. I use apricot scrub (St. Ives) every morning or evening when I shower and then the opposite mornings or evenings I use mild soap such as Dial or Ivory and just do a quick wash in the sink I apply this twice a day most days and I must say my face cleared up in a matter of a week or so, and I can see it helping with under my eyes also! I am Italian so I have oily skin to begin with and I noticed my color in my skin is getting a little darker than it was before. I just hope it keeps working and getting better as time goes on! I have only had this product for less than a month and I am happy with it so far, the box claims to show noticeable results in 4-8 weeks but I notice some things much sooner.",3
5,The palette has enough space for my eyeshadow. It's easy to clean and I like the design as well as the transparent cover. Perfect!,3
5,"This stuff is nothing short of miraculous! I have very itchy, dry skin; any and every cream I've used previously has been only marginally effective. A friend with a similar problem recommended it. I tried it and have been itch free for over 2 years! (Ok, it did meet its match in Las Vegas last March and there was some itching. However, I try to avoid that place as much as possible anyway, except for the occasional family visit. But it did help somewhat when nothing else previously has.)<br /><br />I'm signed up for Amazon's auto reorder - one jar every 2 months.",3
5,"I love that it will lightly color the skin underneath the hairs of the brow. My brows are so sparse, skin is all I can color. It blends really well with a brush. I wish the attached brush were a little fuller.",3
5,I had a 6 year old (or so) Series 5 razor and the 790 is way better.  It does a much better job cutting and I do not have to keep going over the thick and difficult parts of my beard.<br /><br />I recommend you not pay full price. I shopped around and used a coupon from Braun to get this with tax and shipping for less than $175.,3
5,"This is my favorite of all perfumes. When I put it on I get sooooo many people actually stopping me and saying,\\""WOW YOU SMELL GREAT!\\"" I know....someone actually commenting on the way you smell....please believe it. My man loves it also, and so do other men.(I just thought I would throw that in). You will not go wrong with Goddess. You will love it, and so will many others.",3

5,"I am delighted with this purchase, my first foray into peels at home. Perfect Image seemed like a reputable company with high-quality products, and I haven't been disappointed. The product is extremely easy to use, with quality directions and results. I look forward to using other products in this line as well!",3
4,"this is the third bottle of this stuff for me. I love it on my neck only because it is a bit heavy for the face. However, if you have a sunburn this stuff works wonders and aids in the prevention of pealing and wrinkles!",3
4,"These are so very cute. Bright and the exact color as shown, I'm just not sure I know how to use them, but I'll figure it out. Good buy for the price.",3
5,"I was given a gift set that included a Parker long handle razor, Parker badger shave brush, and other products.  I liked the set but the razor was sort of middle of the road for me.  I can't say what it was exactly but it always left my face sore for hours afterwards.  I tried Shark, Sharp, Feather, blades and same thing (although the Feather did not tear up my face - it breezed through my flesh like a hot samurai sword through butter) every time.  I did a ton of research and loved this razor more for the looks than anything else.  It's from Sheffield, England which I've been to and I like that it's not some cheaply made piece of metal.  The chroming on this razor is as thick as I've ever seen or felt and looks absolutely spectacular.  The black handle is gorgeous but does not have any type of grip or grooves so be aware of that.  The biggest thing about it to me was it was tiny!  But it was tiny compared to my Parker long handle and then I realized that the EJ-DE86 is &#34;normal&#34; and that my Parker was the odd man out.  I immediately liked the shorter handle on the EJ as I could almost tuck it in my hand, grip my fingers high up underneath the head and use it as an extension of my hand.  It makes the natural movements around the neck and those odd places like the jaw line under the ear and over the adams apple much more natural feeling.  The Parker long-handle is a twist to open (TTO) design which is quick and slightly safer than the three piece design of the EJ-DE86 but not better.  With the TTO design I always felt that the blade wasn't being held firmly or that blade after blade sat exactly in the same place time and time again.  The blade does all of that in the EJ-DE86.  It feels as though the blade is at one with the razor when it's twisted down tight.  The safest way to put a blade in the razor I've found is to turn the two parts upside-down on the counter and set the blade down onto it, steady the top, and screw in the handle.  Once it's on there you can pick it all up and tighten the last little bit.  So far I've only put in the Derby blade to the kit (Derby comes with the razor) and it went through my whiskers nicely on the first shave.  The second one was a little more rough.  I purchased a mixed sample pack of blades and look forward to trying them all out.  This is an immensely superior piece of kit for the price!  I love it and it looks gorgeous sitting on the sink!  Pick this up!an pick it all up and tighten the last little bit.

5,"After pricing very similar appearing units priced at $260 at the local Lamps Plus store, we decided to save about $200 and give this unit a try.  The unit has only been up for a few weeks, but so far my wife is quite pleased with it.  I was worried that the arm mechanism wouldn't hold up but it doesn't get moved all that frequently and feels secure enough, so I think it will last.  The light isn't all that bright, but my wife says it is fully adequate for her 65 year-old eyes.  So far it's looking like a good investment.",3

5,"This is a rare and lovely fruity floral from the great perfumer Henry Almeras, creator of the world famous classic, Joy. As part of the Ma Collection reissue it comes in a lovely glass botttle with a glass stopper with a pineapple decoration. The full set looks just amazing in a perfume cabinet. Each of these is a jewel of the perfumer's art and worthy of having in its own right.<br />Notes for Colony are: Ylang Ylang, Pineapple; Carnation, Iris, Vetiver, Oakmoss, Opoponax; Musk, Leather.<br /><br />The notes are blended with a delicate hand, with the pineapple not being sweet, but remaining a light theme throughout the life of the perfume on the skin. The heart counterbalances the initial floral/fruity touch, with an earthy, interesting combination of flowers, moss and resin. Leather is used very lightly and this is by no means a Bandit style use of leather.",3
5.0,"This is one of the Andalou products I really like and use regularly.  I have really sensitive, dry skin and this is a very gentle, paraben-free cleanser.",3
5,I am happy with my purchase. This is a good product and this was a very good price. The foundation arrived on time and in good condition. Next time I will order more than one.,3
5,"The same bar is 4.99 at drugstore.com. This must be a mistake here. Do not pay 14.99 for a bar of soap!<br />I just went to this company's website and THEY ARE GOING OUT OF BUSINESS!<br />This is an excellent soap and very bad news, so stock up where you can find it. Bars are only 3.99 at their website skinfree.net",3
5,Son loves<br /> this cologne!,3
5,I am in love with these bobby pins because I can use them for different hairstyles. I like to pin my hair up. I like to stretch my hair with these bobby pins and to hold my hair in place. You will always have a use for bobby pins regardless of what hairstyles your doing. I like that they don't snag my hair too much like those cheap bobby pins from the 99 cent stores. I like that they are high quality bobby pins that last for along time before the black paint starts to fade off of them!!!!,3
5.0,Love this face wash! It removed dirt and oils with only a small amount and makes my face feel so clean afterwards!,3
5.0,"Best file I've gotten so far, I hate the skin on my feet but this bad boy keeps my feet looking like a kid's foot of a lady's foot and when it comes to my feet &#34;dude looks like a lady&#34; is is what I'm going for hehe",3
5,"I LOVE this tanner... and I'm really picky! I am a fair skinned redhead who dreams of being tan. I live in CA at the beach where it's pretty much sunny all year long. I have tested SO MANY different tanners and thus is at the top of the list. It does take longer to apply than a basic lotion and you do have to wait a full 8 hours and then shower to get the full effect (I highly recommend shaving at night and then going to bed with the tanner and showering off in the a.m.) The tan is super natural, golden, and dark. It isn't streaky and has NO SMELL! My husband is happy about that because he hates the smell of tanner usually. Be sure to put a towel in your bed if you decide to &#34;cure&#34; your tan at night or it will rub off on your sheets. Wear the gloves under the buffing mitt or you will have brown palms. If I keep my skin hydrated with lotion after I tan, it will last a solid 5 days. Also, it keeps up pretty darn good if you are in the water. Just try to pat dry instead of rubbing with your towel.",3
5,"I got the 6 pack not even knowing if I would like it and was pretty sad when i first tried it as I thought I just wasted $20 on toothpaste, oh how wrong I was.<br />When I first tried this, I did not like it.<br /><br />2nd time using it.... Still did not like it.<br /><br />3rd time using it, only then did I noticed it cleans better than the mint version... Now I love it.<br /><br />The flavor is something to get used to, but once you get past the flavor, this product is fantastic.",3
5,I love doing my own nails and this cuticle oil is the best I've tried in a long time. Highly recommend!,3

5.0,"The pillow is very comfortable.  The colors are not represented very well on the picture.  In reality, the inner circles are more orange than the picture.  But it's still very cute and comfortable.  In a room where color matching is not an issue, the pillow works perfectly.",3

5,best tweezers I've ever used.,3
4.0,Nice and Cheap~,3
5,It is an amazing straightener! Quick and does the job right :) I am very happy with it and if you get it you will be also.  It doesn't pull the hair at all.  But watch out because your hair will get extremly HOT. Overall great product.,3
5,"Great, thanks!",3
5,"I did not use it yet,but I tried and it looks like to be very good.<br />Thank you.",3
5,Using the Paul Brown hair care products has been seemingly miraculous.  My hair is always damaged from perms or bleaching or hair coloring but instead of dry straw like hair it is actually soft and lustrous.  I recommend this product to everyone I meet!,3
5,"No foot probs here, but this cream has been the first product ever to heal my dry peeling hands. I'd tried at least a dozen hand creams during the past few years and nothing except steroid prescriptions had helped much. Until AmLactin, a product sometimes recommended for worst-case hands like mine. After only two weeks of twice-daily use, my hands have healed almost completely--just shy of a miracle.<br /><br />I only wish I could find the new fragrance-free version described and pictured here. I've ordered from two of Amazon's vendors thus far, and both products received have been the older scented (mildly) version. The same in stores near my home. Wonderful stuff, though, which I'll continue to use in whatever version I can find.<br /><br />UPDATE, five months later... my hands are now almost completely healthy and as soft as a guy can stand. They do still occasionally become dry but only when I'm taking some type of medication or supplement that dries me out overall. Otherwise, I'm good to go with daily use and am once again shaking hands with confidence. I'm also glad to report that my recent shipments have been the new fragrance-free formula. Just ordered five more tubes.",3
5,My daughter loves this fragrance and it is hard to find so I had to purchase both the gel and lotion!,3
5,I am a huge Harry Potter fan and when it came to Gryffindor theme nails for a party this was my go to.  Add a top layer of red glitter and boom!  Stays 2+ weeks and very pretty!,3
4,"My child develops seasonal eczema every year and scratches his itchy skin from October through May.  The constant scratching causes abrasion to his skin to such a degree that any cream we apply causes his skin to sting to the point that he refuses to let us apply anything.  We have tried over the counter moisturizers, holistic remedies from Whole Foods and prescription treatments from the allergist, but nothing really worked and everything caused pain and stinging to his skin.  My husband read reviews about Zincuta, including its positive results in treating eczema, so we decided to give it a try.  The cost for the tin, plus shipping and tax, exceeded $20, but we ordered it anyway.  When the package arrived, we were dismayed at the size of the tiny tin.  However, we began to apply Zincuta to the worst of his rash and within a couple of days, his skin looked markedly better.  More important, the Zincuta did not sting his skin, so he didn't object to using it.  We are very pleased with this product.  At this point, his skin is clear and we are able to keep the eczema in check with an inexpensive over the counter moisturizer.  When the rash reappeared in spots on his legs, we again applied Zincuta and the rash disappeared.  The only negative is the tiny size of the container.  We are using it sparingly, but it is half gone at this point and it's only December.  Likely we will need another container before the end of the cold weather.",3

5,"Reasonable price for a nicely built smaller structured water device. I really appreciated how this seller went out of their way to assure the product arrived in time for me to take on a trip out of the country. This is not a filter, it only enhances by the motion of &#34;swirling&#34; around the interior shapes in this funnel shaped device. Liquids can be run multiple times through the device for enhanced structuring. The results are a fresher, more vibrant feel to the water.",3

5,I love this make-up great quality the colors come on dark and smooth many colors which I like. Must get! would buy from them again.,3
5,Quick delivery. Not smelly like Gold Bond powder. Soft powder. Helps heal those rashes we get when sweating at work or in sports.,3
5,excelente,3
5,This is the best shampoo hands down I have used on my beard.  I've used regular shampoos and products specifically for beards but nothing left my beard feeling this clean.  It lathers with just a tiny amount into a huge white foam and is basically scentless which is good too.,3
5,Bought this as the use of plastic bag in my city has been banned in markets. The shopping bag is actually pretty good and it can probably hold up to moderately heavy (up to ~5lb or so) materials inside.,3
5,I love how this feels on my face. Not oily but very moisturizing. Better ingredients than a lot of other lotions too.,3
5,This makes a good way to refill the pump bottle.,3
5,I was using the other Suave Dry Shampoo and LOVED it.  Imagine my surprise when I tried this one.  It SMELLS and WORKS even better than the regular Suave Dry Shampoo.,3
4,"My shaver worked over 10 years. The screen and the blade were worn out.  It scratched my face when shaving.  I ordered the replacement kit which arrived on time and worked smoothly.  I am happy again.  4-star rating for being too pricey, otherwise, it should get 5 stars",3

5,"I love this toothpaste.  Being a canker sore sufferer for years, I can count on Rembrandt Extra Whitening Toothpaste Formulated For Canker Sore Sufferers <br />to keep them to a minimum.  On the rare occasion I do have a canker sore, I know that it will not develop into a large painful problem.  This product is a lifesaver although it is kind of expensive.  The only drawback is the cost and you do have to use it all of the time to reap the benefits.",3
5,"I received this product from BzzAgent to test. I usually use the power eyeshadows in the little cases and it is always a pain to get the right amount applied with a eyeshadow brush. This is great because it eliminates having to use a brush at all. I can just roll it on. It is also a very muted look. If you are looking for a more natural appearance, then this eyeshadow is great for that. I uploaded some before and after pics using the Lasting Taupe color on my upper lids, Constant Copper on my upper lids, Neutrogena mineral sheer as a foundation, and Neurogena Healthy Lengths Mascara.",3
5,"I recieved The Schick Hydro Silk trimstyle razor from BzzAgent to try out for free and I love it!!!!!! I got a smooth, close shave and I didn't get any bumps on my sensitive legs like I do with some razors. Highly recommend this razor.",3

4.0,"I got the wig in the blonde color for a Halloween costume and its awesome- especially for the price! Its thinner than other wigs I've bought in the past, but I don't have any problem with my natural dark hair showing through, and there's still plenty of hair to work with. The color is great too- a darker blonde than most of the wigs in this range I've been looking at, and since I've got naturally darker hair, I didn't want a super light wig. Don't get me wrong though, its definitely still blonde! The hair is nice and silky and not as shiny and awful as all the Halloween store wigs you see. Very happy with purchase and was totally worth the extra shipping to get it in 3-5 days",3
5,"I have used a wood comb before. I remember how my hair liked it. But then somehow I started to use plastic one after losing my wood comb when I moved to United States. After certain time I realized how my hair was no longer the way I wanted it to be. I have a friend from China and when I asked her for an advice about which brand to choose, she recommended this brand. She said that this is the best comb brand in China. She also recommended to order a horn comb. She has been using it for years and she has wonderful hair. I am very happy with this product. I also like the way my scalp feels. I have also ordered [[ASIN:B00BF62S9E Tan's Peach Wood Comb 0301]]. Both are amazing. As soon as received them, I threw away all the plastic combs I had. I comb my hair everyday; I have been using my horn and wood combs for a month, and I feel that my hair is healthier now. I am also using the most natural shampoo ever, but I am sure these combs contributed to the well-being of my hair.<br /><br />After I received the Tan's White Horn Comb, I realized that it had a small defect on it. I contacted the seller. They responded very fast and sent me a new one immediately. I highly recommend Tan's products. In the future I will be ordering more. These wonderful combs can also be perfect gifts for your loved ones.",3
5,Good stuff - I used to use Coolwater but i like this scent a bit more,3

4,This product works well. I was bit surprised that the highlited areas are pink. I am a man and would prefer not to have a pink hair dryer at the gym but whatever.,3
5,"I absolutely love this brush.  I've only had it a few days.  It feels so good on the skin.  I've used other brushes before and they left me red and hurting.  This, of course, leave a slight glowing to the skin - which is expected, but it doesn't hurt at all.  I will hang this in my spare bedroom with my other merben brushes.",3
5,This is a replacement for an older model and am very pleasd with the razor and it's features.,3
4,"When I received the product, the cap was broken. The product smells weird, perhaps it's the cucumber. I think it does what it supposed to do.",3
5.0,OMG I LOVE THIS LEOPARD CASE!! ITS SO CUTE AND HOLDS SO MUCH!! DID I MENTION IT WAS CUTE!!! YES!! VERY!! ITS SO BIG...I HAVE A LOT OF MAKEUP AND THIS CASE HOLDS IT ALL!!!,3
5,Great product. So far it is preventing any stretch marks on my stomach. It absorbs well and a little goes a long way.,3
5,"This was a gift for my partner. They absolutely love it, however this one has softer bristles, so it's great if you have more sensitive or delicate skin.",3

5,"I use this product almost daily!! and it lives up to it name NO MORE KNOTS.  I when I use this product, i hardly have any knots .",3
5,This is one of the best cleansers I have ever used.  It was recommended by my dermatologist and I love it.  I am 58 years old.  I use it with my Clarisonic and when I am finished my face feels so clean and wonderful.  The smell lingers and is quite pleasant.  It does not cost a fortune either.,3
5,"I just recently started getting interested in nail art/stamping.  I had purchased a few cometitors brand plates which retailed for over $7.00 a plate!  When I heard about this new Bundle Monster set I knew I had to try it.  This set has an assortment of very delicate floral patterns, tip designs, and geometric shapes (as well as a few animal prints).  There is a great balance of designs so it is sure to please everyone!    I also like how each plate came with a blue shield to protect it from scratching while in the mail.  The image plate sizes are also slightly bigger than in the original Bundle Monster plate set, and this comes in handy for people like me who have a wider nail beds.    Overall, even for a \\""novice\\"" this set a not only SUPERBLY priced, but also very very very easy to use with endless stamping possibilities.      This product also shipped very fast and arrived in perfect condition.    Very satisfied customer!",3
4,A little goes a long way. Works well just be sure not to use a lot,3
5,"I looked very carefully at all the hair dryers on Amazon before deciding on this one to replace the one I had that I was very unhappy with.  Why unhappy?  Very large and heavy, but particularly, rocker switches on the front of the handle that any minor adjustment of my hand position while drying would cause a change in my settings.  This seems to be a popular option with many dryers so people must like this, but I find this type of set-up exasperating!  This little dryer is lightweight and powerful.  It dries my thick, shoulder-length hair quickly and leaves it shiny.  It's not overly noisy, although that's not something that bothers me (I expect a hair dryer to be noisy).  But the best part, what I'm most happy about, is the slide switches.  There is no way to accidentally change your settings while drying your hair.  So it's light-weight, well-balanced, not too noisy, doesn't have rocker switches, dries fast, leaves hair shiny, and it's inexpensive.  It's the perfect hair dryer!",3
4,I like it! It is not the best I had but works really good!,3

5,"I usually don't like a lot of color, but I'm trying to step out of my comfort zone a little for summer.  This color is very very nice.  It's not too pink, not too orange and has a tiny bit of shimmer in it.<br /><br />The quality is better than any of the other gel polishes I've tried, including Gelish.  You really only need two coats to get rich color.  It's not runny or streaky.  The polish is really easy to control making it easy to apply.  I am really hard on my nails but this color lasts and does not chip.  It just doesn't seem worth it to use any other brands for the price and quality you can get with TruGel.",3
4,The glitter made a mess in the bag but otherwise we very shiny and fine.,3

5,"The wig came on time, along with the dress, and they look very nice together.  Lots of compliments.  Reminded one of Veronica Lake!",3
4,"I love this perfume! It is very flowery, but also has some other undertones. Although it's been in existence for many years, I believe it is still a modern scent. As regards longevity, it does not stay on too long, but definitely a few hours. That's why I gave it four and not five stars. Would recommend.",3
5,used daily problems obtaining locally,3
5,I was sad when my last Norelco shaver finally died. I think it was 12-15 years old. I was afraid that like so many things the new version wouldn't be as good as the old. I am glad to report that this shaver works great and is easier to clean by rinsing with water. It is also lighter because of the lithium batteries. Maybe should have replaced sooner!,3
5,"I have had this Shaver for about a month now, use it every other day.  Works great!  Leaves legs feeling smooth and works great under arms too.  I have tried it in the shower also, probably glides better when wet, but I prefer to use outside of the shower.<br /><br />Also the shaver never looses power, always ready to go and stays charged during use.  I previously had a Conair razor which I loved but it would not keep its power when shaving.<br /><br />Overall this is a great shaver for the money and I would recommend it to anyone.",3
5,Bought this during the Christmas holidays in anticipation of my S-I-L and daughter's visit.  He loved it and took the entire bottle with him when they left.  It had a nice smell and lathed well.,3
5.0,They are pwefect...love my brushes,3
5,"I love this. SO much faster and less hassle than scissors or trimming with a leg razor. Trims it down so that you don’t have a plushie under your panties, or long strays sneaking out of your swimsuit, all without having to go bare and dealing with itchy regrowth and looking like your trying to look 8.",3
5,Awesome.,3
5,I prefer this unit to the one I owned before.  The power connection is positive as compared to the drop in charging station.  There were more versitile attachments and the power switch worked better on this unit.,3
4,Applied &#34;Walk on the Beach&#34; looks exactly the same as the shade in the photo - goes on easily and produces nearly professional results plus it dries quickly. My nailes looked great for over a week without those mysterious little &#34;nicks&#34; that always appear the next day.  Great product!,3
5,This is a great line of products. Have used for years and the only cream I use for bleeding dry hands that get worse in winter.,3

5,"I've been through quite a few razors over the years, and went to a blade for two or three.  I've also owned several earlier versions from Braun.  This is by far the best electric razor I've owned.  I can't say that it is blade close, but is not off by much.  This has more power than my last Braun, runs quieter, and cuts through two to three days of growth easily.  I had to make several passes with my previous razor due to my heavy beard.  This unit cuts the time in half.  The shave is comfortable, and the cleaning/charging unit works great.  Though the included paperwork says to run a cleaning cycle after every use, I've been doing fine with every three to four day cleaning.  I've used it several days in a row without recharging with no noticeable decrease in battery power.  Battery power, cleaning reminder, and length of time of your last shave are displayed on the LCD screen which is easy to read.  Looks great, though it does take up a bit of space on the bathroom counter.  Not cheap, but definitely delivers.",3

I don't have a specific brand or razor I absolutely love or use all the time. When this razor came I tried it out almost emediently. The one thing I noticed first was the color was bright yellow. When I opened the package it smelled good. Its a nice vanilla scent I enjoyed. I also liked that it came with a hanging thing to hang the razor in the shower, I thought that was smart. I noticed the Olay bar on the razor, which is nice because you don't have to use as much shaving cream. There was is nice grip to the razor. So it does not slip. I really like this razor and will be purchasing another cartridge. I will recommending this razor to family and friends. Thank you Venus & Olay for the great product!",3
4,"Master Review For Both Vitamin C Serum, and Hyaluronic Serum.<br /><br />Product Overviews: The products both work with initial contact. They both smooth your skin, and give you a slight natural glow. The Hya. Serum is very thick and slightly sticky, but nice. It is easy to spread, and will last a long time. You only need a drop or two. The Vitamin C serum, however, is very watery and not very spreadable, and I found myself having to use a lot. It will probably run out 3x as fast as the Hya. Serum. They did not irritate my skin at all, and had a nice light scent. I will update this review in the future, with further details of long term usage on skin, for both me, 18yrs old, and my mother, 50yrs old, to report on the effects for both young and old skin.<br /><br />Packaging: The packaging was good. A flip up cardboard box, which encased the two bottles wrapped in a light amount of bubble wrap. I think the bottles would be much safer in their own boxes though, because they easily could have been damaged during the handling process if it was handled by a clumsy postman. Each also came with a 25% off coupon.<br /><br />Customer Service: The customer service for this company is A+. I annoyed them purposely. I emailed them at least three times in the week they were shipping, just asking how to order, why the shipping wasn't working, why my package was in a town for so long, etc. But they always responded within 24 hours of my inquiry, and were polite and thorough in helping me out, and making sure I was satisfied.

5,"Not only did the supplies get to me in Germany quickly, but they included instructions that were helpful on many levels. From design ideas to mixing instructions and tips to do it right. I was so pleased!",3
5.0,My grandson loved them!,3
5,Beautiful scent & very nice for gifts or for personal use!,3
5,I suffered many years from the hard skin on my foot. This cream effectively alleviated the painful cracks on my heels.<br />I highly recommend this product.,3
5,"Nice smell, works like a deodorant should. How to explain the smell.....clean? mildly fruity towards a melon smell but not overly sweet.",3
4,Need to make instructions in English if your going to sell it to this country. Everything was in Chinese. So instructions should be in other languages if sold to other countries and be made clear.,3
5.0,Bought this and works great.....recommend this one,3
4,Good,3
5,"Love this product.  It's the ONLY thing that's helped my husband's dandruff problem.  Sadly, it is no longer being produced.  Hardly anywhere has any of this conditioner left now.",3
5,"Great product! Produces results very fast. Highly recommend!Love all the Devita products, as they accomplish what they say they will, and are ideal for my sensitive (with rosacea) skin.",3
4,"Works well and I like that it is non-toxic. Only thing is it has a weird smell. It smells like rotting apricots! So if you can get over that, it's a good product otherwise.",3
5,"This is a very well made product, and it is just what my niece requested for her birthday.  Very pleased.",3
5,"Great mascara, up there with the best. I like that it comes off in flakes while washing instead of smudging off.",3
5,"Best natural, and animal friendly, product that I have found for clearing up zits overnight. I really love this stuff.",3
5,"I have used other razors in the series. This is by far my favorite. I put it into my Power handle and it makes short work of my scalp and facial hair.<br /><br />No knicks, no abrasions.<br /><br />Winner!",3
5,Wild Berry brand incense sticks are the best. They smell true to the scent and they burn about 1 hour. This is my favorite brand of incense. The aphrodesia scent is very good.,3
5,Fast delivery and product came as expected. Thank you.,3
5.0,I love the consistency of this 100% natural product.....not sticky.  I add it to my facial toner.,3
5.0,"Gratiae sales hype-An guy named Igor in the Paris Hotel area pulled me aside and offered samples, and then asked me to sit down and try these products. I did feel like I noticed a difference, but when he quoted me $175 each for the eye serum and the lifting serum, I told him that was too expensive, and that I would need to do research before laying out that much money for a product I had never heard of. He then began to apply a mask to one side of my face and said the mask sells for $599 in Neiman Marcus, but if I purchased the eye and the lifting serum for $350, he would throw in the $599 mask for free! I told him no, that I had to research, and would come back the next day- oh no, I could not do that he said because he would not be there, and this was the last mask he had. That sealed it for me, and I told him no. He became very rude, and was showing me a so-called website with the prices posted. He also said the product was featured on Dr. Oz. When you click on the link on their website to Dr. Oz, it goes to the show, but no mention of Gratiae!! The next day, I went online and saw similar reviews to this one, and purchased all 3 products on Amazon for less than $100 total. It is the exact same product, and I do love it, but don't be swindled by these crooks! When I went by the booth a couple of days later, a girl was pushing samples, and I told her that I had ordered from Amazon, and she said that is too bad because it is not the same product. Again-erroneous information.",3
4,product is just satisfactory<br />i am allergic to so many ingredients in sunscreen & lotions so am very pleased that so far this works for me,3
4,"yes I use this once a month on my face to expoliate to rid dead skin, I use with warm water and rinse my face in cold water to close the pores.....Korean do that 424 regime.google it...I expoliate for 44 seconds.",3
5,"What a great product for swimmers. Apply before swimming, go swim, and then shampoo out. Leaves hair healthy, shinny and strong.<br />This even works in the mornings on dry hair, to get hair under control, and remove the frize",3
5,"I have used this product for almost two years.  It is very helpful with my arthritic knees, it does not relieve all of the pain, but I find I do not take as much ibuprofen when I  use this product.  The special ingredient devil's claw is what sets this pain relief ointment apart from others I have tried.  I have bought this for friends and family and all agree it is the best pain relief ointment they have used. Also - it does not smell as so many others do.  I use it daily in the morning, and sometimes in the afternoon.",3
5,I have a clarasonic and i dont use it after getting this.It works faster than the clarasonic and feels like its working better.Worth the money if you dont want to spend so much on the clarasonic.,3
5,"Actually thought there was going to be oil in this but that's the salt AND oil scrub. My mistake. Lol. But nonetheless, this product is amazing. I love it. My family loves it. It exfoliates your dead skin cells leaving your skin really so much softer and healthy looking. I use it all over my body before I shower. Very satisfied",3
4,"After a flare up of eczema on my lips I decided to attempt a scrub instead of a traditional heavy-oil based treatment. This worked beautifully to clear it up in under one week and leaves my lips feeling like silk afterwards. That said, it does have a peculiar artificial flavor. The flavor would not deter me from re-purchasing.",3
5,"This product is awesome, and I've got the chance to buy it for a very good price. I do recommend.",3
5,I purchased this as I can no longer find it elsewhere and is a particular favorite of mine.,3
5,"I just started using mineral sunscreens instead of chemical ones.  This one was highly rated and I'm very happy with it.  It does go on white, but the white fades quickly and it is not white within fifteen minutes.  It has a very slight pleasant odor like eucalyptus, and the odor also is gone very soon.  This works much better for me than my old chemical sunscreens.  I wish it came in a smaller size so it would be TSA compliant.",3
4,"Fast ship (prime), appeared as described, the quality is ok. It does dry my polish within a few minutes. I am very happy that it is formaldehyde free. But I noticed shrinking and chipping after a day. Nothing is perfect I guess.",3
5,"This was a gift for my daughter, she loves it. No more bending down to use a mirror & being able to see the back of her head is a bonus.",3
5,Great for the price,3
4,"I did a considerable amount of research before I selected this product.  I wanted something biological/enzymatic in nature with simple ingredients.  I also like the fact that you make your own batch fresh each time and can use what ever fluid you which to make the mask.  For example, it says to use water but you can also use yogurt or even lemon juice if you wanted to lighten your skin at the same time and your skin could tolerate the fruit acids.  It does a good job of exfoliation but makes my skin flush after use.  But I flush easily.  This would be an outstanding product for most skin types but if you flush just avoid those areas and focus on the T-zone where most of the sebum is located.  I let mine site for at least 5 minutes prior to application to soak up the water.  I also have added plain yogurt to give a cooling effect to the mask and slow down the drying.  If this mask completely dries on your skin it can be a little troublesome to remove.  Dampen a wash cloth and press to your face to hydrate the mask and then remove the mask.",3
5,This is the best cream I ever have for my baby he suffer of exema  thanks god some one told me about this cream . I know a lot about cream he's 6  years old I've buying cream since he was born thus is the best,3
5,The oil arrived fast and packed well. It was exactly as described and perfect for my needs. An all around great experience. Will order again.,3
5,"I just got into essential oils and searched MANY websites to find a diffuser that was rated high and priced pretty reasonably. This diffuser fits that description perfectly. I got it at a great sale price and only wish I bought two instead of one! My husband and I turn it one right before we go to bed and it shuts off when the water runs out. It's so nice because I don't have to worry about it ruining the motor! It's very quiet and love the soft lights. It's also nice to turn off the lights if you want to. Also, shipping was amazingly fast!",3
5.0,I use this treatment once a month along with the treatment conditioner.  I apply to clean wet hair and cover with a hot towel for 30 minutes.  Love these products!,3
5,"Could'nt find this anywhere, came to Amazon and there it was!!! Thank you and this a great hair product!!!",3
5,"Best perfume I have EVER smelled, hands down. Bought it for my wife for here bday. This scent isn't just for tweens/young adults. My fave!",3
5,"I have been using this useful product for quite some time, but it is now hard to come by in stores.  The ability to purchase this product in bulk and via mail is both convenient and cost-saving.",3
5,"top notch stuff and really holds without all the mess, highly and most definetely recommend for your hair extensions and seller ships it immediately no long waiting period, AWESOME!!",3
5,This is the best nail saver I've used since Ahava stopped making their nail strengthener. I highly recommend this product.,3
5,I had my doubts about this but figured what the heck.  They turned out to be just perfect and easy to use and replace.  Quite a bargain for the price and they really work.,3
5,Perfume came 2 days earlier and it is the real deal!,3
5,"OMG I love this stuff! I got a sample of this with my HSI straightener, tried it once and ordered. I've used various oils (coconut, olive, moroccan etc.) but this is the BEST. My hair is color treated, long (past the bra strap) and thick and a very small dime-sized amount distributes easily and evenly through my hair and the end result is not oily-looking or feeling, just soft and protected!",3
5,I've used this for several years and find it helps give volume to my hair - I really like it.,3
5,Fast delivery. .love the product..thank you!!,3
5,"Great mask it is adjustable, stays on your face, and muffles sound. The mask is fairly lightweight but puts enough pressure to keep your eyes shut and they are wide to keep light out. If you are someone who needs complete darkness this mask will do the trick. I highly recommend.<br /><br />Edit 08/13/2013:<br />I have purchased this item a second time for my husband, and he has not complained about it. It can be adjusted at the back with velcro. The mask covers the upper face well and keeps light out, while the sides also muffles sounds. It is a good product I would highly recommend and purchase again.",3
5,Perfect and cheap,3
5,"I absolutely have to agree this previous reviews This is Rich, Rich soft Moisture!  I LoooooooooVE it! My skin feels soft, smooth and  Super Hydrated. I feel like I have found Eden's Secret Garden.  Wow! I took a chance on this product since the review were great! I will definitely purchase it again.  Thank you Avalon Organics you are doing great!!!",3
5,"I love black polish, and this one is really different. The fact that is matte makes it very different than most other polishes.",3
5,Matrix products have always been great products.  This is why I continue to use them.  They do what they claim to do.,3
5,"Great product! I wish if they sell them in a sprayer instead a dropper. Other than that,  it's my favorite product out there. I am a male in my late 30s and my hair looks better than it looked 10 years ago.",3
5,"Takes make up off better than so many other expensive products I have used. I can wash my face with a cleanser, use scrub cream, wipe with toner then wipe my face off with Ponds, I still get a make up residue and dirt on the cotton pad.",3
5,I really like this mirror.  As I am aging I can see my skin and apply my makeup flawlessly.,3
5,"I, too, have tried several other exfoliators.  I often splurge on facial products sparing no expense on quality.  This is by far the best exfoliator. When you open the jar you are greeted by a light, lovely, clean scent. You will notice the almost white sand that could be from some exotic secret beach.  I usually run one hand under the facet to collect a small amount of water in my palm while my other dry hand is used to pinch the sand out of the jar.  I then place one or two pinches into my wet palm.  This prevents any waste of the product.  After rubbing the palms together, a foam begins to develop.  I then rigorously scrub my face and follow with my Clarisonic.  I do this 2-3 times per week depending on the weather.  My only concern would be if you have sensitive skin this product may be too abrasive.",3
5,Love this scent! Very classy/sassy... Not strong at all.. I receive many compliments on this perfume..,3
5,"Just a tiny bit, maybe a dime size amount will do my whole beard. This stuff lathers up like nothing else I have ever seen.<br /><br />My daily regimen is a wash/condition with this product and some bay Lime conditioning oil. Leaves my beard shiny, soft and it doesn't get out of control.<br /><br />Pretty expensive, but it's a good product and probably will buy again.",3
5,The mask arrived in terrific time. I love how the sleep mask feels and how it improves my sleeping during the day. I work the night shift and it has been hard for me to get enough sleep - now with this new sleep mask I believe I can catch the necessary ZZZzzz's<br />I definitely would recommend it to anyone.,3
5,This mirror was just as it was described.  I am very pleased with the quality.  I chose one without the lighting so that there was no need to worry about electrical connections.  It is sturdy and does the job.,3
4,it was easy to apply and had no streaks!  It had a light smell to it but it was not a bad and no one said anything.,3
5.0,I feel very good,3
5,"For whatever reason, I was starting to sweat a lot under my arms, which made embarrassing sweat stains.  Not sure if it's just the fact that it's a new type of antiperspirant (aluminum chloride) vs. other types (tetra...?), but this stuff worked.  Comes with 8 towelettes, which you can use 1/week.  Used it for all 8 weeks and had success the whole time.",3
5,"Was new to tanning when I bought this. Love the smell. Does not turn you that rusty color, got a nice gloden brown.",3
5,Great hair care product at an affordable price.,3
5,"I have extremely dry and damaged-looking hair (even though it isn't damaged).  No amount of leave-in conditioner or VO5 has helped.  I discovered the Camera Ready product at my hairdressers but found a better price for it on Amazon.  After drying my hair completely (either air dry or blow dry), I lightly spritz this all over my hair and (using the LOW setting) gently use my round styling brush and blow dryer to style my hair.  Wow!  What a difference.  Now my hair looks like the hair in hair-product commercials...rich and conditioned....best word for it is 'yummy.'  I love this spray!  PS-- If you're going to use a curling iron, go easy.  If your hair is wet with Camera Ready spray (or any liquid) and you expose it to a hot curling iron, you risk damaging your hair.  An occasional treatment like this is okay but don't do it frequently.",3
5,My mom bought me the roll on of this and it was so good that I wanted a bigger bottle of it! Good buy!,3
5.0,Love the products and the service was outstanding!!,3
5,Love this file! It was always used when I got pedicures and I wanted to keep my feet as smooth at home as well! Totally worth the price!,3
5,My wife uses these heads on her sonicare toothbrush and she loves them. Definitely take advantage of Amazons subscribe and save program and receive an additional discount!,3
5,"Bought this for my mom, she loves it.",3
5,Seriously the pinnacle of customer service. I cannot praise highly enough the quality of product and the perfect balance of professionalism and kindness shown by Tom's Incense. A+++++,3
5,"If you like pink and you have very fair skin then this is the lipstick for you.  One of the things I like best about Lancome lipsticks is that they are extremely moisturizing.  I have use just about every brand of lipstick on the market and Lancome is by far the best.  My lips always feel very healthy....no cracking, bleeding, peeling.  I highly recommend this product, especially the Vintage Rose color.",3
5,"Burt's Bees is an incredibly moisturizing lip balm/shimmer/gloss! Usually anything this moisturizing does not have the amount of color that this has. My lips feel so good after wearing this all day, but it looks as good as lipstick! It isn't sticky or smell bad like a lot of lip glosses, either. It has no taste (no strawberry, for example). I think I am one of the last holdouts to try Burt's Bees, but now I am a believer! I highly recommend it.",3
5,Bought this as a present for my husband and he loves it.  He has given up using razors all together because he finally is getting a close shave with an electric shaver.,3
5.0,great stuff,3
5,A great brush for shaving beginners and old shaving pros. Loads very well and keeps wet for an entire shave. Highly recommended for all ages.,3
5,"This is the first time I ever purchased or tried the anti uv manicure gloves. I must say that it was a great purchase. I am not sure how other brands work but this did the trick for me. Fits great, not tight and it really protected my hands under the UV light at the salon.",3
4,"I'm a big fan of Dead Sea bath salts, and this particular scent is nice, but it is a strong eucalyptus scent, so only get this if you like that scent. This one is made with essential oils of eucalyptus and supposedly this essential oil hels relax sore muscles. We just use it for psoriasis relief and to relax. I'm not too fond of the color though.",3
5,"i like the mirror and lighting is wonderful too, price makes this an excellent product to purchase and I use it every day.",3
5,"Love these extensions I currently bought the medium auburn and decide it to dye my hair blonde, so end up bleaching them and then dying them, for my surprise they were still in good condition, I deep condition them for about a hour but if I were you I wouldn't bleach them I just buy the right color as it will not look as it did when they were new because of the bleach. the only problem I had with them it's that they get tangled easily so I suggest getting the hair you wear detangler that will keep them from getting tangled. They are so easy to apply and the clips stay in place it's one big peace so it saves you time in putting them on. in my opinion they are worth every dime you won't be disappointed with this hair peace, it arrived very fast",3
4.0,"Works great on backacne but bottle doesnt last, so it can get expensive to be re-ordering ever 2 weeks",3
5,"I've used this soap for years because I love the color and fragrance, and it lathers well. The price is amazing, and the wrapped bars look pretty in a basket in the bathroom. My favorite.",3
5,"This is a good quality mirror.  It has the features one would expect, for a price perhaps lower than what you would expect to pay.  The mirror rotates from standard to 5x magnification, and it has side mirrors which can be angled for profiling.  It has four distinct lighting options, \\""Day, Office, Evening, and Home\\"".  It also includes a handy receptacle in the front for accessories such as hair rollers, blow dryers, flat irons, etc.<br /><br />The quality seems to be good.  Overall this is a nice product, and if you are in need of a cosmetic mirror, it is recommended without reservation.",3
4,"You'd think my dry skin would just drink it up, but it doesn't..",3
5,"They are replacement brushes they work just as the original one. Not much to say about them, buy if you need them",3
5,"NEED TO KNOW INFO : I ordered these blades and they came in grey, black, and red packaging  labeled Crystal Stainless Steel Blades with a sticker on the box showing the description of the correct blades I ordered. I checked on the internet and several people stated that the correct blades were inside. They were right. I opened a box and inside I saw the correct packaging that you see advertised on Amazon. Blue box,blue dotted wax wraper, stainless steel platinum coated etc... These are the blades I ordered as represented on Amazon.They are very good and I am ordering more.",3
4,It in nice brush and i use it for foundation but after using for a while it had started to kinda fray and spread out. But i will still be using it. I just got my eyebrushes too and hopefully they will be as good.,3
4,"I tried this out for the first time today and am very happy with how smooth and soft my hair is feeling afterward. The product itself feels a bit weirdly slick in the hand, but smells nicely of vanilla. It doesn't leave any lasting vanilla scent in my hair, as far as I can tell - but I also have short hair so your mileage may vary!",3
5,This really speeds up the drying process and seems to prolong the length of time the polish stays on the nails.  Great stuff!,3
5,"Good product, you will have a few hairs come off of it but that's normal, dries quick and lathers very well.",3
5,The aroma from this bottle of tsar is one of the best around.I have been wearing this for about twenty years and i always get a good compliment on how good it smells.,3
5,I'm very happy with this bronzer. It has a beautiful color and it blends nicely. I do use a makeup brush to apply it. I did not like the applicator that it comes with.,3
5,"This is an amazing product for your skin! People can't guess my age! I have used all kinds of products for much higher prices and not gotten such pretty skin. This is my go-to-can't-live-without every day face and body cream. I apply it after I rinse my face or take a bath to lock in the moisture. It keeps your skin moist and supple and seems to lower any swelling and redness as well as minimize wrinkles. If my skin needs extra help, I use it together with Jason's 20% vitamin C creams or their Hyper C serum (is a booster in minimizing wrinkles and erasing sun and acne spots fast). I get amazing results for a great price. I love Jason products!",3
4,"I am a huge Janet Evanovich fan so I had to try this. In true Bvlgari form it only takes a small amount to get the job done. The scent is nice but it goes away quickly. If you are a Bvlgari fan, try the Avqa. It smells amazing and the scents lasts much longer.",3
5,"i just love this product, its very handy to have Amazon keep ordering for me, I am handicapped and I find it amazoning to my personal well being !",3
4,"The only problem I have is this press comb does not have wide teeth, so you have to be careful the comb does not snag your hair.  You can easily adjust the heat settings.",3
5,"This soap is incredible.  The scent is so refreshing.  Now that I have found it I will never use another soap.  No tight feeling in skin only soft and fragrant.  Not overpowering, not too sweet, not too citrusy or woodsy, just pleasant and clean.",3
5,Always a must for cleaning extra makeup! A must in any bathroom!,3
4,"I like it because it smells great, it works okay and it doesn't leave me feeling sticky afterwards!  Love it a lot!",3
5.0,"Use for mouth pulling.  Cold pressed, and great value!",3
5,i love this brand. the shine spray smells amazing!! ps: also have the hair mask & it is awesome as well!,3
5,Love these lashes they are easy and so soft and comfortable,3
5,I've been using foundation for many many years and have found that this is the best I've ever used. It doesn't clog your pores and goes on like silk. I woul highly recommend it.,3
5,This shampoo brought my hair back to life - love it!<br />I utilized it combined with the mask - same line - and alternated with the Resistance line. Highly recommend Kerastase.,3
5,I bought this product for my dad and he loves it. He had Norelco before but the battery died and the new battery didnt perform as good as the old one. So we got him this one. He loves the fact that he can wash it to clean.<br /><br />There might be other products with extra features but ask yourself : Do I really need the shiny digital display or Do I have to have the X feature.<br /><br />Buy 8140XL and trust me you will love it.,3
5,Product came in wrapped perfectly. It's exactly what I need to make lip balm!,3
5,This was the best curler I've owned!! It works as good as a $200 one! Deff really happy I ordered this. I use it everyday and it works great with my hair. It curls your hair quick and easy and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a curler,3
5,"I love this brand, YSL.  It NEVER disappoints me with the colors and longevity of wear.  I highly recommend it!",3
4,"This product is described as a gloss balm, and I think it has much more of a balm texture and finish than a glossy one. That said, I really like it so far. It feels almost like a chapstick, but the color is surprisingly rich. My lips feel really smooth when I rub them together, and the color has stayed on better than a typical gloss. If you want a shiny finish, you'll have to add an additional clear gloss on top though because the finish isn't glossy at all. I have Cabernet and it's a rich berry color. Very pretty. I think I'll buy a few more colors and keep them in my purse as a brighter alternative to lip balm.",3
5,I use this in our homemade toothpaste and we love it. I have noticed my breath seems fresher for longer than regular toothpaste.,3
5.0,good,3
5,"This brush is just awesome.  I have not found a foundation brush that doesn't leave terrible streaks in my foundation (MAC Studio Fix Fluid).  As a matter of fact, I had given up on foundation brushes when I decided to give this a try.  This brush is so good at blending.  I put 2 pumps of my foundation on the back of my hand, pick it up with the brush, and then blend it in to the skin starting in the center of the face.  That is enough to do my whole face.  I use a circular buffing motion.  After that, I go in and spot conceal with a different concealer.  This gives me the most flawless finish!  For those of you finding it impossible to get this brush clean, let me recommend to you the Daiso cleanser for Puff and Sponge - I got this here on Amazon but you can also find it on Ebay.  It will get everything out when other cleansers do not.",3
5,Crabtree & Evelyn product quality is excellent.  This particular sandalwood scent is in perfect balance...soft edge.  Soothing on the face.  Husband prefers this lotion in this scent for many years.  Not easy to find...thanks Amazon.,3
5,"Perfect! A little less full than I imagined, but still perfect. I can use it for Pinkie Pie and Princess Bubblegum!",3
5,Bought it as a Christmas gift.  Have never personally used it.  But the recipient seems to enjoy it well enough.,3
5,A delicious smelling and decadently rich cream that is a luxurious joy to use.,3
5,This product is the best lipstick out there it gives me the color I want without the chalky feel of lipstick and it moisturizes your lips so buy this product and pucker up!!,3
4.0,"Definitely a good shampoo. One of the only ones that didn't cause dandruff for me. I ended up switching to an organic based shampoo that was sulfate free in the end, but overall a great shampoo.",3
5,"Never received  this however gave it a five star because the vendor sent me a nice note and can recommend this scent based on already owning and loving the body butter and fragrance mist. Such a clean feminine scent, one of the first florals I have loved and that doesn't give me a headache. If u can get this in the body butter its worth it the texture is so decadent and rich.",3
5,Fantastic product. I used it on vacation to the Bahamas. The lotion did wonders when my skin usually does not react well with lotions. Definitely recommended.,3
5,really good,3
5,"Before you get the wrong idea from my review, let me state my opinion: \\""I love this product!!!\\""  I will not repeat what I've read in other reviews. Instead I want to give you an idea of the durability of this product. Here goes. After a while of using, I noticed that batteries were coming out damp, about 10 months after using daily. I change them about every two weeks, using NiMH rechargeables. I thought I was just being clumsy while changing the batteries and making them wet. But I methodically dried it up before opening the battery compartment. It never occured to me that there was water leaking or water infiltration into the unit. Now after 15 months it finally died. It no longer turns pump on. Being out of warranty I opened it. I found the pump motor had rusty water all around it.   So what did I do about it? I bought several more as replacements. It gets used at least once a day (sometimes 2 or 3), to keep braces clean. It sure helps protect the orthodontic expense we are going through. We cannot find another product that is as portable (small size) and practical (no power cords or coiled hose to deal with) to store on the bathroom counter. It is also super compact for taking on trips (it survived going to Europe and Mexico).  I'm a first time user and I was skeptic about its value. If you find it at 30% off retail, then consider yourself lucky and get yourself one!",3
4,"I really like this fragrance but it is just a little bit overwhelming. Either way, I recommend this product a lot.",3
5,"Smaller than I thought, but I like them.",3
4,"I  took away one star because if I use more than the tiniest dab it's overwhelming for my fine, thin hair, and I just want a shampoo.  If I use a dot smaller than a pea, it really does add thickness.  Use sparingly and it will do the trick!",3
5,"Excellent quality, great perfum, it is the perfect gift for every women, I love it, I would like to buy the man version of that.",3
4,"I first got this perfume as a gift, I fell in love with this sent. The stores were I lived sold out of this perfume but I had to have this perfume again! After a friend told me Amazing had it I was overthrown with delight!!! The only thing that's different about this one is that the scent doesn't last long! Other than that I love this perfume!!!! Love love life!",3
5.0,I love it,3
5,"The line of women outside my front door waiting to get a whiff of me wraps around the house twice and goes 3/4 of the way down the block.  KIDDING!    I've always been an Old Spice-and-call-it-a-day guy when it comes to \\""scents,\\"" but bought a sample pack of Klein's men's fragrances on an international flight a few years ago and seemed to get the most compliments and attention when wearing Obsession for men.    So when the sample pack ran out, I hit Amazon and this is the best deal I found (4 oz after shave, 4 oz eau d' toilette -- stronger than after shave, more for evening \\""touch-ups\\"" before you go out -- for a great price).  Love it, thanks!",3
5,this is the perfect cologne for my husband it smells so very good on him we plan to buy more,3
5,Item received as described.,3
5,I switched from SoniCare to Oral-B and the difference is like night and day.  My teeth look and feel much cleaner!  Added bonus is knowing how hard your pressing down when brushing . . . .,3
4,"Came faster then i expected. Nexxus ProMend has done its job, it also came with a leave in treatment, all 3 for a GREAT price!!",3
5,"COSMEDICA's leading seller is this pure hyaluronic acid serum in the 60 cc (2 oz) bottle. Once you've tired the smaller bottle in the prep and tone set you'll want to always have this larger size on hand. This hyaluronic acid is Vegan and completely free for oils, parabens, dyes, fillers and fragrances. After cleansing and toning the face apply this serum and watch your skin improve almost instantly! Though it is not advertised as such, this serum is also VERY useful for making aging hands look better. Apply to the hands twice a day and notice that the skin plumps, and the variation in color improves. Anther for buying the larger size bottle - use on both face and hands and see a return to that healthy younger look. Grady Harp, December 14",3
5,"This is a lovely, soft and full kabuki brush that is just as good ( I actually like it better) as the Bare Minerals brush that I have<br />used for several years. I had wanted a kabuki brush to keep in my purse with my minerals foundation and checked out Amazon prices.<br />I'm thrilled that I took a chance on this much cheaper brush and will certainly tell my friends about it. Thanks for a well made brush at a reasonable price!",3
5,"I wash my face about twice a day everyday, so I needed something to put the hydration back into my skin and brighten it up a bit.  A friend recommended me this product so I decided to try it out and see how it works.  It feels super light weight on my face and absorbs into the skin quickly, also it doesn't make my skin feel oily by the end of the day.  Would defiantly recommend this product to others!",3
5,"I love these brushes!  They are a great set, easy to care for and use.  Excellent value for the price.",3
5,I love this prodcut,3
5,"I have had other electric toothbrushes and never been satisfied with them because of their being to rough and believe it or not to much of an \\""echo\\"" in my head when using.  The first time I used this toothbrush I could feel the difference with the nice smooth feeling that you have when you leave the dentist.  This did not bother my gums at all and it has three settings that you can choose from to satisfy your needs and the noise is almost nil. I highly recommended.",3
5,can't live without it!,3
4,"I was looking for something that wasn't cheap, yet not too out there. There are so many to choose from and I'm glad I found this one.",3
5,"I originally got these tweezers as a party favor at a ladies luncheon.  They are amazing!!!  They grab all the little hairs that I can't get with my other tweezers.  Unfortunately, I lost my original pair and could not live without them so I bought a new pair on Amazon.",3
4,Very comfortable! Especially if you are sleeveless material is comfortable on skin does not create much friction. I've been on crutches for 25 yrs & haven't found better yet. I reserve 5 stars due to longevity.  These will last about 6 months with daily consistent use. But worth every penny.,3
5,HSI digital ceramic straightner .  It heats up fast.  It works well. I did notice that it loses a little bit of heat after about 10 passes. I have to gi e it a few seconds to heat back up to the selected tempature. It fits great in my hand . I like it and I would recommend this product.,3
5.0,"Best facial moisturizer I ever tried and used. It makes my skin smooth, hydrated, and radiant. looking younger with less wrinkles after 1 time. The moisturizing really lasts all day and I tend to have drier skin, living in sunny California. The ingredients are amazing- a combination of top active ingredients lots of natural oils with collagen. The texture is smooth and light. A little bit goes a long way.<br />I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to nourish their skin and look younger and beautiful.",3
5.0,It was fun to wear!!! Thank you!!,3
5,Love this lotion..it has helped my dry skin tons. My skin feels and looks so much healthier since I've been using it. Plan to try other products in the Hempz line.,3
5,really nice hair! I purchased for my daughter to start new school year.  she says dont forget where i bought it.  i have this seller on standby.,3
5,"I've always been a Gillette man. I've tried other razors in the past, but Gillette has always given me the exact results that I look for in a razor. When I was given the opportunity to try the new 3 in 1 styler, I jumped at the offer. I've never been one to \\""manscape\\"" but with this product I figure I would give it a try. The first thing I did was trim up my side burns a bit. I was blown away by how easy it was to get them exactly like I wanted. My wife even used it to trim up my chest and back more to her liking. This is a great product, and one more reason that Gilette will ALWAYS get my business.",3
5,"A nice weight comb.  Hard to tell if it is sandalwood, but it smells nice, and is lovely.",3
5,So amazing!!!! I've been using this for a few days and have had amazing results! My skin has never felt softer! I am so happy I have this product!!!@,3
4,Love this lip stick.  It glides on so smooth like a moisturizer and it feel great on the lips.  this shade i bought is primarily a red shade.  Pretty and worth the $6.  I will buy more of this in other colors.,3
5,"Loved it, came early and my boyfriend was so surprised when I showed him what I got for him. I couldn't have been more pleased. Thank you.",3
5,This mascara gives you almost a FAKE LASHES look with your own lashes...Makes them much fuller looking  adn also longer. My daughter in law turned me own to this mascara and I love it!,3
5,Very sweet and delicate looking but strong enough to keep my think hair in place.  I wear it with a bun and it fits around the side of the bun nicely.  My granddaughter has threatened to &#34;steal&#34; it from me.  Very nice.,3
5,This fragrance truly smells like roses.  I love it.  If you like how roses smell then you will enjoy this.,3
5,Perfect,3
5,"The mask is amazingly comfortable. It blocks out light better than any other sleep mask I've tried (and I have tried a few!) The side straps could be a little more comfortable, however, that is the downfall of most masks. I'm ordering more as presents for friends.",3
4,"I have used Stri-Dex medicated pads by themselves and with other products and must say that they do remove a lot of dirt and oil, (you can actually see the dirt on the pad after wiping your face!)and they do not burn at all like some other medicated pads do, however they won't help your skin clear up by themselves. I use the pads along with Clearasil Ultra daily face wash. It works so well. My skin is smooth and almost always blemish free. I used to have large pimples (the kind that hurt to touch) all over my face, but such inexpensive over the counter products have really made a difference for me.  Try it!",3
5,What more can be said? Everything was as advertised. Fits shaver and works like it was new.  Would buy again.,3
5,"Great product, delivered on time! Would recommend!",3
5,I love this stuff.  And amazon is the place to buy it.  I used to get this 2 for 20.00 deal at a store...and I find it on amazon actually cheaper!  And the product works great and is amazing!  Smells good too!,3
5,this mascara was amazing. best one ive tried so far and very black. im glad i purchased the 3 pack and i will be repurchasing. it came on tiem and the packaging was great.,3
4,"Works great as a matte powder. removes the shine without making my skin look too cakey. the only problem that I notice is that It says transculent, but after putting it on I notice a slightly darker tint to my skin",3
5,"The seam really is invisible. If you stare at it you can make it out but once you look through it at your own reflection it falls out of focus and disappears.<br />There is a small turn-knob on the left side used to adjust the alignment. Adjust it by staring at faraway objects because any misalignment is amplified at a greater distance.<br />The enclosure is molded plastic, not spray-painted wood or anything cheap.<br />There is a brace affixed to the back that hooks over the included flat wall hook. Screws and anchors are also included.<br />I recommend purchasing from truemirror.com because it offers other sizes and other colors. If you want hot pink just ask; they may have it in stock even though it's not advertised.<br />Dimensions of this model are 12\\"" by12\\"" by 7\\"" deep.<br />Here's a video of the mirror:<br />[...]<br />Here's an interview with the mirror's creator (starts ten minutes in):<br />[...]<br />As for the affects of the mirror I have noticed that my asymmetrical features seem even more pronounced, probably just because I'm so used to seeing the skews reversed. But beyond that it's not a huge difference from a traditional reflection. It doesn't make me want to change the parting of my hair. But it's a high-quality mirror that perfectly frames my entire neck and head, even at a close distance, so it's worth it if you can spare the money.",3
4,"This was my first time doing a Brazilian wax and my first time using hard wax. I used to use shaving cream and razors, but it irritated my skin and made it itchy. Then I used an epilator, but that wasn't too clean and it was unbearably painful. Finally I resorted to trying hard wax. I first purchased this one based on some youtube reviews and several of them recommended this. I got mine at Rite Aid, even though it is a bit more expensive than amazon, but at least I had it right away.<br />After researching a whole lot on the whole process and reading the instructions, I went on ahead! BUT! IT IS SO PAINFUL!!! It is my first time and I know first times usually are more painful, then as the root grows weaker, waxing is easy, but sometimes it wouldn't rip clean and would end up in clumps and I would end up tweezing the hair under the piece of wax to free myself from pain. Pulling downward was a lot better than upward, but many people recommend going up against the direction of the hair. Sometimes it would come clean, sometimes there would be several pieces of hair still left, and I would just tweeze them out. It is quite messy, and I don't know where the mango and peach scent is, but I don't smell it. It just smells like plastic with a hint of something else. I used a total of 4 hours to just wax my face, armpits, and bikini area. I really hope it gets shorter when I'm more experienced. It doesn't seem to grab onto short pieces of hair too well though.<br /><br />Edit after using product twice:<br />After using this twice, I can say that this is a nice product. I was more skilled at using it after two times and the hair is thinner and easier and not painful to wax off now. Just remember to exfoliate! Other than that, no complaints.",3
5,"This product fully lives up to its hype!<br /><br />In fact, when it first was introduced, I believe it was \\""The Wall Street Journal\\"" that waxed eloquent about the fact that this product actually did what it was supposed to do.<br /><br />Very impressed with the supplier also...the inclusion of samples for other products is appreciated.",3
4,"I really like it, I think it looks nice with my complexion (I am somewhere between beige and white...though I do get VERY tan over the summer) unfortunately this wears off SO quickly! I put it on in the morning and within like an hour it's all gone :( I don't know, maybe I don't have the right &#34;skin&#34; for this? My skin is normal (not oily or dry) so I don't know what's the problem. But the color is very very nice!",3
5,Really good,3
5,"Amazing product ,better than what i expected ,not painfull for me and very soft result ,3weeks now and i'm still feeling the softness<br />fast delievery",3
5,received on time and the brushes are great!,3
5.0,These are just what I was looking for to use on my daughter's very sensitive diaper area. They are also very nice for baths and the size is perfect.,3
5,"I love OPI. Their lacquer is high quality, lasting a long time, going on easily and smoothly, and of course looking beautiful and shiny. This color is very playful and happy, good for summer.",3
5,We use it as a diaper cream works great. Nice smell easy to clean off. Begin using it for 5 yes no rashes at all in that time,3
5,"we're used to that bite of alchol in our mouth wash.. Not here with this and it really does make your mouth feel fresher longer.  Not so sure how it would work after you just ate Limburger cheese, onions on dirk rye however.  :)",3
5,I love the metal roller balls...they glide so much better than the plastic roller balls. I would highly recommend.,3
5,Fantastic!  It works wonderfully.  Perfect to keep up GREAT looking feet between pedicures.  Easy to use with instant results.<br />Love it!,3
5,excellent,3
4,Like it.,3
5,"I cannot rave enough about this stuff. Really rub this in, and it will get all your makeup off. Actually, it doesn't seem to work as well with Covergirl's Clump Crusher mascara, but I haven't found this to be a deal-breaker.",3
5,"Sally Hansen's Salon Effects are my newest obsession!  These babies ain't cheap, either!  But when you consider the wear and that you don't have to \\""touch up\\"" every other day, then you almost forget the price!  The trick is to center the stickers on your nails.  I like that they include different widths for each nail so I can customize my fit.  I enjoy a narrow sticker on my thumb for instance, to give an illusion of length instead of the sticker going from cuticle to cuticle.  I can choose a narrower thumb sticker and get the look I want.  Now for the wonderful part.  They last FOREVER!  I'm a mommy whose hands are forever in a sink or toilet or washing machine and yet, the stickers don't peel or chip.  I think the trick is to press them on very well from the beginning.  I center each sticker then press and roll my thumb from side to side to make sure there are no edges or lumps.  When I come to the tips where the extra sticker is hanging off, I just file it down toward the table, not upwards, so the sticky part is pressed firmly onto the tips.  My method seems to work wonders b/c I don't even mess with my nails until its time to choose another pattern, three weeks later!!  It has also allowed me to grow-out my nails which are normally VERY short b/c they distract me from the growth, which I'm used to biting off!  I know, gross but true.  It doesn't hurt that everyone ooohs and aahhhs when they see your hands too...\\""how did you DO that?\\""  You just wait, nail polish bottles are a dying breed!",3
5,"About 95% effective... noticed a big difference - you just have to apply it several times (which is fine because this is a great deal). First time I ordered it they came without the exterior packaging (tubes only), and this past time they actually came in the Bikini Zone box as pictured. Either way, good value.",3
5,"I'll never use a cartridge razor again. This product convinced me after the first use. My skin is sensitive so I easily get razor burn and ingrown hairs, but that's a thing of the past.",3
4,Amazing treatmet but leaves hair a little bit oily. Fast shipping.,3
4,I used this product just a few days and can see results improving my skin discolorations.  I would recommend this product.,3
5,"Wonderful scented candle.  And powerful.  It could handle a very large room.  For a smaller room, the candle can be lit (or under a candle light) for a short time, then turned off and the scent will linger quite a while.  The scent is very refreshing.  No heavy floral overtones.  Not offensive at all, even if on for a long time.  This is one of my most favorite candles.",3
5,"This is a waterpik accessories and again don't wear clothes.  It does clean your tongue but there are challenges like if you open your mouth you will be showering and have that gagging feeling but when you close your mouth your mouth will fill up with water to the point to decision swallow or spit.  I mix my water with mouth wash w/ enamel and I have a separate enamel care, you can't swallow those products.  I am still trying to get use to it.  I am new and you have to master it.  Nevertheless it does get the job done.  I hope that my reviews really helps out because I read other reviews and that will give me a sense on whether to purchase or not.  You have to use products at your own risk because products work differently for some people.",3
5,"l Iove this product, and I have used it for years to help to strengthen and protect my nails. I have soft brittle nails.",3
5,"I started using the Cera Ve lotion about a week ago. It claims to have beneficial ceramides in it.    According to Wikipedia \\""One of the most studied roles of ceramide pertains to its function as a proapoptotic molecule. Apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death, is essential for the maintenance of normal cellular homeostasis and is an important physiological response to many forms of cellular stress.\\""     [...]    This idea seems to apply to my skin, as old cells seem to be dying off with new healthy ones replacing them.    Whether or not the excerpt is true, my skin is far less bumpy, softer, and brighter.     It looks like I'm wearing powder, that nice soft finish without that pore suffocating look of cream or liquid makeup.    I love it. It's inexpensive and it sure is doing its job. I've tried A LOT of drug store products and this one is actually doing something for me.     Awesome",3
4.0,"This definitely made my skin tan better! It is super moisturizing. I purchased this on Amazon due to the great reviews. I don't really love the smell, it has a little too much perfume scent for me and not enough coconut. It's not terrible though so I will keep using the entire bottle. Will probably purchase something else though, because if you are a coconut lover this is not the ticket.",3
5,"This is by far the best stuff yet!!!  LOVE IT!!  Wish I could get a bigger size, as 6 month out of the year I am affraid to order it becasue of the melt factor.  Might just have to drive to Dallas for it!!",3
5.0,Oil free. Good for every skin. I will buy over agin,3
4,It seems to be working well on my face and you can't beat the price for the quality that you get and the shipping was very fast even tho I didn't pay for speedier shipping. I didn't really think the smell was bad as some mentioned but I opted to add a few drops of lavender oil to it and now it smells divine!!  I'm also glad that it came in a glass bottle whereas some put theirs in plastic which is not conducive for oils.  I will purchase my oil from this vendor again!~,3
5,Exactly what I was searching for.  Love this for my wet hair after I shower.  Instead of a wrapping a towel around my head that would constantly fall off.  Product made well and launders easily.,3
5.0,The battery on the first toothbrush out of the pack is still going 80 days later!  and my dentist said my gum health has improved since last 6 months check up :),3
5,"These lashes are fantastic! The are soft, long and thick, and the make your eyes look Great! Buy them, you can't go wrong.",3
5,Great product at a great price.,3
5,I used this Zen care SS treatment once a week for two months now. It works out great. I felt my hair more soft and silky. It is a bit pricey but worth it.,3
4,This worked just fine until I slept overnight.  In the morning it had peeled/rolled off leaving a huge bare spot once again on the very top of my head.  I feel like a circus freak if I venture out but I guess I have to wear hats/turbans for the rest of my life.<br /><br />I do think the product would work just fine for the usual thinning issues.,3
5,"Unlike other expensive products that I've tried, this cream keeps my skin soft without the hefty price tag. You definitely get a good bang for your buck with this cream.",3
5,Fast shipping will buy again,3
5,"This is a product I use everyday, I would highly recommend it to anyone. Not only was valuedirect the cheapest around, but they shipped it to me unbelievably fast!! It came in two days after I ordered it! I will definitely be ordering again. Thank you!!",3
4.0,amazing curl on my daughter's hair. The only downfall I've noticed is her hair gets tangled in knots easier when we use this product,3
5,"I have Type II skin, rarely ever tans and is more prone to burn. So I have to start out tanning at 4-5 minutes a day for a few weeks then add a minute each week after. Tried using Hero Worship, but had a slight skin reaction. I had used this before in the past so I switched over and got a good tan after a few weeks. But remember I can only tan for a few minutes everyday, so comparably to everyone else, I got darker than Ive ever gotten trying to tan outside or in a bed before. It does have DHA in it but helps someone like me that doesnt tan easily, and it looks natural. Ive also found if I cant make it to the tanning bed after a few days I tend to use it as a lotion before bed, let it soak in and dry and it still gives me some color. All around GREAT product!",3
5,Really works well.  I thought I had an extra toe growing on the side of my foot-- less than 1 minute and it was gone.  Product seems much sturdier than less expensive models and easy to use.  Delivery came sooner than expected.,3
5,"I had been dealing with crow’s feet around my eyes for a few years now. With my 50th birthday around the corner I got a bit worried that the lines would get worse. I searched around and found DNA Serum. I was a bit skeptical at first. I mean, snake venom? But I decided to give it a try anyway.<br /><br />I have to say that I was blown away by the results. It only took a dab around each eye to do the trick. The wrinkles were smoothed out. They didn’t completely disappear but it did give me the best results of any product I’ve ever tried. I think it might be the snake venom that is the magic ingredient. The only downside is that for the price I wanted the cream to work on other areas of my face.<br /><br />Its pricey for just an eye cream, but again, it’s the results that really count. My family has noticed the difference, so I’m not complaining. I will visit the company website to see what other products they offer. If this one product works this well I’d love to see what else they offer.",3
4,"If you get nicked as much as I do while shaving, this is all you need.  Not only does it seal the wound, but it removes the sight of blood, helping your face and neck look smoother and not like a connect-the-dots book.  Yes, it stings, but it's well worth it.  Great value for the price, and Clubman is a name you can trust.",3
5,"Beyond Paradise was my Christmas gift from a dear friend and I was really surprised how well she pinpointed a perfume that is not only totally gorgeous but one that works so well with the chemistry of my skin. The fragrance is a prismatic rainbow of juicy fruits and florals, heavily laden with succulent honeysuckle and musky base. I love the lasting power of the fragrant aura that envelops me the second I pray it on and the bottle looks absolutely breathtaking on my dresser. The scent itself is heady and aromatic, more floral and sophisticated than most tropical fragrance; I don't smell bananas and coconut here but soft orchid, pulpy woods, juicy plum and soft dewy honeysuckle with its sparkling golden nectar. <br /> <br />This is one of my favorite perfumes now, something I reach for very often and something that puts a smile on my face whenever I get a whiff of it. One a rainy and gray monday morning I feel that I can carry a layer of ambrosial paradise that sets on me like a soft cloud of euphoric proportions as it nestles itself into my skin and exudes a shimmery cloud of scent all day long. It's really a rainbow of happiness in a bottle.  <br /> <br />The top notes are Eden's Mist, Blue Hyacinth, Orange Flower Templar, Jabuticaba Fruit. Middle notes are Laelia Orchid, Crepe Jasmin, Mahonia Japonica, Pink Honeysuckle balanced over a base of Natal Plum Blossoms, Ambrette Seed, Zebrano Wood, Golden Melaleuca Bark for a sweet and fruity concoction. <br /> <br />- Kasia S. <br /> <br />",3
4,"Ordered December 9, 2014 arrived January 21, 2015. It's nice💪 feeling like a goddess, took them forever to deliver though.",3
5,"The first two days of use I absolutely loved this! The third day though the pink pad has popped out of the corner on the curler and so far I can not get it to stay in. I can still use it, and it's curling fine, actually curls the best of any one I've ever used. However, not being to get the pad to stay put is disheartening, and it makes me wonder if the pads will come completely out as others complain of, or if the next refillable one will stay put. I hope it does not continue coming loose, because I do love the curl it gives. One thing I really am happy about is the bright pink pad. If it does fall out I will notice it's missing, I had one of the plain chrome ones that the pad had fallen off of and I didn't noticed it till I pretty much cut most of my eyelashes off (this was many, many years ago) but you don't want that to ever happen.<br /><br />I am editing (finally learned how to find my reviews) and upgraded this to a 5 star. This is the best eyelash curler I've ever used, and I'm no spring chicken! Initially, my pad fell out as I noted in my original review. The company promptly sent me the correct size pads out (evidently some were sent out with the wrong size) after reading my review, and now I could not be happier. This has never pinched my eye,and wow do you EVER get fabulous looking eyelashes that last all day! I really mean mine look like false lashes they curl so well. It is amazing how much younger your eyes look when your lashes curl correctly. I can't say enough good things about this curler, it's truly awesome. For those not liking it, maybe they aren't using it correctly. I read once to start at the base of your lashes, crimp and move up once, crimp, and once more, crimp, and with this curler if you do that, your eyelashes will look amazing! Plus I really love when a company cares enough about their consumer to actually read our reviews, and immediately take care of the problem. Can't ask for any better customer service. It's very well made so I anticipate this being with me for many years to come!",3
5,"My roommate had this and immediately I smelt it from across the room and had to purchase it. She's almost done with her second bottle! Smells so fresh!! With a kick of flintiness, all the guys on campus were friends with come in our room and can't put that bottle of lotion down !! great for using after you shave and shower as well.. love this product and it last forever!!",3
5.0,my wife's hair comes out extra silky smooth with this product. two pumps applied to wet ends of hair is her method,3
5,"This body lotion is great to use when it's hot outside because it's very light and sinks into your skin quickly.  It doesn't leave you with a greasy or heavy feeling on your skin, not to mention that you're getting a giant-sized bottle at a great price.",3
5,"I received my first tube in my Christmas stocking and it is now my lip balm of choice. Goes on moist, offers great protection. No more cherry-flavored candle wax on my lips!",3
5.0,I have used this color in the past because it is the closest i have found to my original color and it adds shine.  Mega reds' the only hair color that does not dull in my hair within the first month. The shine lasts.It arrived about a week early so that was nice .  Love Mega Reds!,3
5,This is my favorite makeup.  It goes on easily and lasts all day.  I have fair skin and the light to medium shade works well for me.,3
5,"they have a very strong grip, perfect for separating hair while straightening/curling",3
5,Goes on great! Very smooth. No disgusting smell and seems to be working good.,3
5,Great,3
4,"My daughter wanted this for school.  It doesn't quite fit all her books, but she loves to tote it around when she can.",3
4,"You have to have thick enough hair to make a thick ponytail for this elastic ring to fit around it; it's not a tight small circle of elastic. The curls are bouncy and pretty, but around the elastic it's a tangled mess. I cut it open and took the elastic off; it's basically a weft of hair sewn to a strip of elastic. The color was a nice dark brown.",3
4,this is a really good product for the price... Im happy with it its really shimmery the way i like it,3
4,as expected,3
4,"I do love this product, it's nice and doesn't make me break out.  That being said I Hate the price!!!  I'll probably be looking for a more affordable option.",3
4,I really like this face cream.. Wish it came in larger quantity.. I went through it too fast.  I can recommend,3
5,Veyy good product.  Serves me well.,3
5,I had been looking for a long time for one of these. I bought two. One for me and one for my sister. We both love them.,3

4.0,No helmet head here! Just soft hold and gentle ingredients. So glad to have found this product!,3
5,Loved it! Came in perfect condition. The color is amazing! I definitely recommend this polish for evryone!!! Thanks again! :),3
5,"this item created loads of fun,great novelty gum that also has good taste.all the women in my family was thrilled.",3
5,"I was wary about purchasing at first because of the steep price and the smattering of negative reviews about this product. When the 'free buffer kit' option came up, I jumped at the chance since I figured thats the best deal I'd get!  I followed the directions very closely, as some reviewers emphasized this.  I tried the orange color 'hazard' and kept a close watch on how my nails held up.  It's been almost five days, and I LOVE ACQUARELLA.<br />There is no chipping yet!  I am a designer who works in an active children's museum, and I am constantly being exposed to glues, inks, paints, etc so most nail polishes last for about two days or so.  Not to mention there are a variety of curious animals I work with that want to inspect colored nails!  I expect to lose some shine and color with other polishes.  However, this nail polish holds up magnificently!  I am genuinely impressed, the only wear visible is at the very tip of my nail the color is just a tad worn off.  But that's just me nitpicking, no one would notice.  I haven't tried to remove it yet, since the color's been holding up so well, but will update when I do.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-No crappy chemical smells!  I can get super close to my nails and cover evenly without having to worry about inhaling chemicals during application<br />-Five days and still has that lovely 'just applied' shine<br />-Very opaque, two to three coats will do it!<br />-GREAT dry time, I was moving about normally within minutes, and I had applied three coats<br />-No unnecessary chemicals for me to worry about<br /><br />Cons:<br />-More colors, please!  What about a lovely yellow or light green?<br />-Super expensive!<br />-Preparation takes a bit longer than traditional polish",3
5,funny,3
5,I have been searching for some good brushes and am happy to have found these!  They are very soft and pick up the product nicely!,3

4.0,"I tested the eyeshadw on the back of my hand first, as i have very sensitive skin, and left it on overnight - no irritation at all.<br /><br />So then I used it for applying makeup for a bridal shower - the colors were really bright and popping, easy to apply becuse they didn't fade, they were very pigmented. The only thing i find is some of the shades are very shimmery so you have to be careful using them for daytime makeup. But all around awesome pallette and presentation! Would definitely buy again.",3
5,petunia skincare feels gentle on my skin and hydrates really well. I only need a tiny bit of the product for it to cover my entire face. The product smells really pretty and natural and I feel like I am using a natural product as well. I will continue to use this product for a long time in the future!,3
5,fast and fun for the kids,3
4,"This is a wonderful moisturizer. It's hard in the jar, but it applies smoothly over the skin. The only down side is that it gets greasy after a couple hours. I just wipe the greasy layer off when it gets to that stage, and my skin is still super smooth. I definitely wouldn't put this on under makeup, I use a different moisturizer for that.",3
4,"I've had oily-to-mixed, acne-prone skin all my life. Living many years here in an arid climate where the dryness and strong sunshine take a toll on our facial skin, I was always told by dermatologists to use moisturizers especially on the dryer areas of my face.<br /><br />Over the years, I've tried countless moisturizers that are supposed to be hypoallergenic, noncomedogenic, for sensitive skin, etc. However, they were either worthless as moisturizers, or more commonly they caused my skin to break out in blemishes. Then I tried this cream, as a nighttime moisturizer, and I'm delighted. It absorbs, feels nice, seems to help ward off dryness and tightness - and no breakouts.<br /><br />I'm sold, and I'm delighted to find it here on amazon.",3
5,14 yr old daughter was in her glory Xmas morning!! We always bought the cheep models and they never lasted and took her forever to straighten her hair and still not Straight.... This cuts time by 3/4 and looks great!,3

5,My sis says it is making a difference on her acne scars.,3
5,Came quickly and is as described.  Thanks!,3
5,"This product is amazing! I love Olaplex.. My hair has never looked better- EVER! A++<br />Worth every penny.<br /><br />This is take-home deep conditioner to use once a week on towel dried hair and you leave it in for 10, 20 even 30 minutes before shampooing and conditioning normally. It's also an in between conditioning system paired with 1 & 2 mixed in with your hair color. I suggest trying to use it again properly because I am a very critical person and I absolutely love Olaplex and feel like I can never go without it...<br />Another thing about Olaplex is not only does it repair damage it mainly protects your hair from further damage and allows someone with very dark hair to go even a platinum blonde without a cotton candy feel to the touch as a result. My hair is so soft and shiny because of it. I cannot rave on enough about Olaplex.<br />Also, this price is excellent. One bottle if you are lucky enough to find it in stock at your local salon, is $28. One bottle should last anyone using it 8 weeks.",3
5,[[VIDEOID:be447b4565665242b80e030fe4b60ba8]]I've tried every alternative and some even higher priced.<br />There is simply NOTHING like this! I'm so frustrated I cannot find this in stores anymore!<br />GRRRRRRR!<br />Other spays make your hair all sticky the next day- this does not and I have been using it for years.<br />Love it!,3
5,Perfect!!!,3
4,This is the most natural looking self tanner I've ever used.  It lasts several days after one application and doesn't rub off.,3
5,good,3
5,I ordered another bottle because I noticed how much thicker my hair has become,3
5,"I've been using this product for a very long time and it is amazing...However, I suggest that if you purchase that it is fulfilled by Amazon.",3
4,"It's hard to write a review on conditioner - I've been using this for a couple of weeks and think that it's good - not great. My hair is typical for a guy - just past the collar, a little over the ears.  Mine is fine and really curly.  I've found that some conditioners enhance the curls - I hate that.  This leaves my hair easy to comb, but I don't notice any extra &#34;bounce&#34;, etc. Probably because it's short.<br /><br />For the price, it's good. I tend to spend as little as possible on shampoo and conditioner, so this is better than I usually use.<br /><br />Overall opinion: I like it, but would probably not use it again. I think the scent is too strong, and what it does for my short hair is nothing special.",3
5.0,Excellent product.,3
5,It's an incredible product that's worth the price. I highly recommend it!!!! For smooth and detangle hair this product stands apart  from all the rest.,3
5.0,"good price, good product.  Been using it for years and it does not dissapoint.  Too bad the stores don't sell it anymore.",3
5,If I could only get my teenager to use it more often! Works well though!,3
5,"I've been using this wash along with the hydrating gel for about three days and I can already see an amazing difference. I'd never heard of this prior to seeing it on the shelf at CVS, but when I picked it up and compared the active ingredient percentage to other brands I was impressed. Neutrogena's &#34;Acne System&#34; only has a .5% Salicylic Acid content whereas this stuff as 2%. That's a big difference, and you can really tell!<br /><br />Be sure to pick up the spot corrector and the hydrating gel too. All three working together and you'd never know that I was horribly broken out just three days ago.",3
5,I am a runner who shampoos daily (sometimes twice in one day) and this product is great because it doesn't seem to harm my hair as most other products would (and have) if I were to shampoo so often.,3
4,"I live in the desert where the temperatures are extreme, which is drying to the skin.  My son has dry patches on his arms, and legs, which is easily treated with baby lotion.  I noticed his dry patches fad quicker with this formula than with Johnson's Original Baby Lotion.  I'm not sure why that is, but maybe it's because I like the fragrance, so I'm more inclined to use it.  In the morning, I can detect the smell, but only slightly.  That said, the fragrance of the Bedtime Lotion is strong.  It's so strong in fact that I'm not sure I would use it on a newborn.  That may sound weird... but when my son was an infant, I bathed him in the morning.  The Bedtime Lotion might be a bit overwhelming as an all day scent.    <br /> <br />When shopping, I was a bit disappointed when first cracking the lid of Bedtime Lotion.  I couldn't whiff the calming fragrance, because Johnson's now seals their lotions.  Actually, they warn buyers not to use if the seal is broken.  Obviously, this precaution is good for buyers, but I see a downside to this as well.  Shoppers already familiar with Johnson's Bedtime products know that they contain lavender, and chamomile, so the seal is a safeguard.  The remaining sector must read the description to discover this important fact because they can't smell the product before purchasing.  Many might put the lotion back on the shelf if they were able to smell it first.  Johnson's doesn't specify the lavender, and chamomile in the ingredients, only in the blurb.  Why is this important?  Well, the ingredients have been known to cause problems in people with asthma, and allergies. <br /> <br />In addition, I wish Johnson's would re-design their lotion bottles to duplicate their Softwash product where the lid is placed on the bottom.  The lid on the Bedtime Lotion is placed at the top making it difficult to get out the remaining squeezes.  Overall, I'm very pleased with this product as an evening lotion, because the fragrance fades overnight; however,I probably wouldn't use this lotion in the morning, as the scent is a bit strong. <br />",3
5,"These cotton tipped applicators are perfect for cleaning small channels, grooves, recesses and hard to reach places in firearms.  The cotton tip doesn't fall apart or shred and the wooden stick comes in handy for scraping harder to remove gunk.",3
5,This lotion allows me to sleep through the night without hot flashes.  Wish it came in larger size!,3
5,It met my expectations,3
5,My sister ordered this brush and I used it a couple times. She really loves it and uses it after she showers or when shes just brushing it.So far it feels like a well made brush.,3
4,the rhinestones and fimo do look like that in the picture but the seller doesnt give you that much. you should read the description. its about 20 pieces of rhinestone and 10 fimo which isnt alot. in the picture it looks alot more. some of the dotting tools look like it has the same size tips.,3
5,"I would like to say that this conditioner is definitely worth it especially with the shampoo, I love how afterwards my hair feels light & not weighed down. I'm surprised that I haven't seen it in stores, I love that I can actually style my hair how I'v always wanted to because of this product,  I'm so happy that I'm getting the results I wanted & not getting jipped out of my money. Would definitely recommend this awesome secret combo^_^",3
5,It's descent and and holds all my needs so I give it five stars. I love it and would buy it again if needed.,3
5,I just love the smell and feel of this lotion -- great product!!,3
5,i absolutely love this product...great set of clippers to own in your home or in a place of business...enough said.,3
5,"This stuff is great.  I am mid-40's with acne prone skin, and this product has been wonderful. There is no break out reaction.  It seems to calm my skin.  (probably the anti-inflammatory properties of the turmeric!)  If having super clean porres/skin wasn't enough- my skin has never felt softer an more supple.  It does the job 2 or 3 products, and does them well. I plan to buy some more very soon.I don't want to run out.",3
5,Love the smell and the foaminess and delivered quickly! Thanks again!😁,3
5,"I use this as a messager/brush for my dog and cat.  They love it, it doesn't pull on their fur and the bristles provide message.",3
5.0,Makes transferring a pattern so easy!,3
5,"I had a brush like this years ago with two kinds of bristles and liked it, so I ordered this and found it to be exactly what I wanted.  Sometimes I'm not in the mood for a comb or else it doesn't do the job and so this comes in handy.  The brush isn't real big and so I imagine it would be handy for taking on trips.  Even the stiff bristles aren't bad, but then that may be a matter of choice.",3
5,"works great,  looks stylish, durable",3
5,Amazing  heavy duty and having super thick Italian hair it holds it will defiantly be buying more in different colors,3
5,This stuff makes my hair so shiny and happy. It is the same kind featured in the rooms at Disney's Grand Californian Hotel. The classic container is also a great reason to get it and the matching conditioner and body wash. Looks great in the shower!,3
5,This is one of the biggest makeup brushes I own. I have been pleased with this brush and use it when I'm applying powder or liquid foundation. It's soft and you know it's doing a nice job for you.,3
5,This shea butter is top notch.The people over at Cleopatra's Choice go ABOVE and BEYOND! They are an amazing company with an incredible product and unparalleled customer service! I'll be buying more in the future for sure :),3
5,They stay in place with only one piercing but no pinching. The level of artistry is remarkable for the price ! These have detail even on the back ! Great stocking stuffer for that edgy teen/young adult in your life...or treat for yourself !,3
5,I love them! They are exactly what I was looking for at a great price. They style with my curling iron too! There perfect :),3
4,"There was more wave to the hair then I was expecting, I think because it was probably kept in packaging for awhile, But I can deal with it, still really long and a great color.",3
5,Every color in this collection is awesome!  Mini bottles won't last long. Maybe 3/4 mani's but that's fine. Still a great deal from Amazon.,3
5,"This healed my nipples while breastfeeding; better than anything else I tried.  It is very smooth, soothing, and easy to apply.",3
5,I love this product! I would recommend this to anyone who has natural ethnic hair. It helps the hair with shine,3
4,When I started the BzzAgent campaign I was skeptical. Up until this point I absolutely hated any clear gel deodorant because it left my clothes with a huge wet mark. When I got the package I was pleasantly surprised with the scent. It is very fresh but not overpowering. Secret outlast completely clean claims to work for 48 hours. I recently took this on my trip to India to test this out. It did not work 48 hours that is why I did not give it five stars.  When I did put it on in the morning it did last until night time though.  All I had to wait was one minute or so before putting on my clothes and there was no wet marks. I will deftly be purchasing this product in the future.,3
5,It is perfect one. I love it!,3
5,On a hot sticky day lavender powder is just the thing to make you feel human again!,3
5.0,Product works well. Go light with your touch,3
5,"Have already reviewed these several times since I have them in several colors.  They are well made, fit well, don't slide down your nose, and come in good colors.  My absolute go-to glasses.  Will probably get another couple pair.",3
5,"I've used this foundation for years and I love it.  It's mineral based, so it's breathable, but gives great coverage.",3
4,"The chalk came and looks exactly like it does in the picture, and was packaged well so it wasn't broken. I really love the colors, but your hair must be very wet for the lighter colors to show up. I'm not sure if it's the chalk, or the flat ironing I do afterwards, but my hair gets very... static-y as well. Either way, the colors are great, and the wetter your hair, the more pigmented it'll be. Very happy!",3
5,This is an amazing polish for latex.  One swipe and it looks like my latex is wet and shiny which is what I was looking for.  it also causes a cooling sensation and is a wonderful easy to use product!,3
5,"Got here when it said it would. Smells great, but its not very strong. I will say it seems to be the real deal, not a fake knock off.",3
5,"No base required, dries with natural sunlight or day light.  Nice shine. Great colors  I always mess up one or more nails with this fast dry polish no worries.",3
5,"for 5 years I,ve been suffering or having this kinda some part dry and some part oily skin and if the weather becomes too hot or cold it gets so bad. Because of this I couldn't even wear make-up or even press powder as the break outs really noticeable. I purchased this product just to try if it works as I've tried a lot of products and none worked at all. But with arbonne, realistically within 3 days I saw and felt the difference and now it's winter and very cold here in Canada my skin stays smooth and no more dryness, red patches and itchiness all because of arbonne.",3
5,"I didn' even know eyelid primer even existed. I was watching some make up video's on You Tube and thought I would try it. Makes you eyeshadow look better and stay on longer. Thanks Smashbox, I love it.",3

5,It was delivered on time and in great shape.  Wife loves the clean fresh scent.  This is just what she was hoping for at Christmas.,3
5,Best deal on best little Angels! Customer service got these to me fast.  Gave to my non profit group as recognition for their Angel like work. Thanks!,3
4,"I love this dryer.  I have really dry and curly hair and i used it along with some of my products and it straightened my hair very nicely.  The ion setting is great.  My hair wasnt very frizzy at all and was pretty straight!  Its easy to use, though I will say on occasion I have turned the Ion part on and off along with the power since all those are push buttons and right on the handle.  but in general its not really that much of a bother to me.",3
5,"I have very dry/irritated skin, and this body wash works very well for me. Other products claiming to be for dry skin and have a &#34;moisturizing&#34; label have never seemed to make the cut. This body wash almost makes you feel like you have used a moisturizer or lotion. It is fantastic.",3
5,"\\""The Face Shop\\"" is a casual brand to beat Body Shop in Korea, purchased and operated by LG company.<br /><br />The tonic's \\""shakey\\"" ritual part of the yellow ring is fun thing to do every morning.<br /><br />And, the 3-4 pumps of one application of this liquid is just ample thing to do with my skin type, although they asked me to use some other essences after this solution. not greasy, and and hold moisture for my dry-yet-greasy-in-T-zone-in-the-afternoon type of skin.

There aren't any more fine lines from the hot sun during the summer period.My pores breathe without any troubles till night or next morning.<br /><br />Its smell is very light and fresh salad-like, and I enjoy it. Whether you are men or women, this will be a quite surprise and amazingly priced. I am a big fan of the FACE shop. Two thumbs Up!",3
5,I travel for work and carry a food bag.  This is a perfect little set.  It even goes through TSA just fine.  YAY!  Very happy.,3
5,"I'm a 36 yo guy who has dealt with acne most of his life.   I have tried everything, 1/2 a bottle in and this stuff is working very well.   I still have a pimple or 2 every once in awhile, but it keeping my skin clear and not near as red.   Buy a bottle and give it a shot.  I like it because it is light weight and dries fast.  Also you don't have to use much, it covers entire fast really well with a pea size drop or so.   Give it a try, I'm ordering a couple more bottles tonight.  Hopefully they keep making this, best stuff I've used in awhile.",3
5,"Very good eyeliner, I like that it goes on gently & wears well. I recommend it & would buy it again.",3
4,"Great price, plan to get long use from these",3
5,I added this to my cart because I needed one more small item to get free shipping. What a pleasant surprise. I love this! It goes on smooth and has just enough color to be pretty but not obnoxious. Very fun product.,3
5,"I am constantly researching and searching for the most effective anti-aging sunscreen. I love the Anthelios brand in general, but as for sunscreen goes it's my favorite yet. The Mexoryl sx protects against UVA rays that cause 80% of sun related aging. I have acne prone skin, and this hasn't caused me any breakouts. The ultra-light sunscreen fluid doesn't contain mexoryl, so for vanity's sake I stick with spf 50 fluid extreme. It also goes on with a matte finish and feels comfortable / undetectable under my make up. I can't wait to get a bunch of the heavier options for my body, and days I may be in the sun more than usual!",3
5,"I love this shamphoo. It only takes a tiny bit to work up a lather...one bottle can last me 6 to 8 weeks, and I have shoulder length hair. It is rather expensive, but the results have been well worth it. My hair is softer, more manageable, and has more body. The longer I use it, the happier I am with it and with my hair.",3
5,"I have loved St. Ives products for years.  You simply can't beat the product quality for the price.  The formula is gentle with lots of plant extracts, so it is wonderful for my picky skin.  This particular cleanser is a light cream, fragrance free, easily washing off makeup, oil, and dirt.  It's hard to find in stores, as most places only carry the scrub, so order plenty here!",3
4,A good deal for the price.  This shade is not available in lipstick form so happy to find it in the outlast all day color.  It does need the clear balm as the color does dry quickly on the lips.,3
4,When most mink lashes run about $40+ these are great!  They look great on too.  The only reason I take a star off is b/c if not careful the lashes fall out quit easily.,3

5,Great product,3
5,The moment I placed the wig on my head; I instantly turned into Marilyn Monroe. I have worn it now 7 times on stage (community)  and it shook our nicely each time. I have a very large head for a woman ... So it was very snug!,3
5,I wanted to reach my back without a back scrubber.  This towel is very good.  It has a coarser fiber pattern.  That's exactly what I was looking for.  A step up from the regular exfoliating mitt.,3
4,"I have a funny face in that I need both an electric and manual shaver. I shave first with the electic and then touch up with the plastic shaver. Now trust me I've tried everyone under the sun ranging from the cheap to the expensive and I always have the same problem, cuts and nicks.<br /><br />While it took a bit to get used to it I can now shave without worry about cutting the heads off my moles, it doesn't pull and hurt the way the plastic ones do.<br /><br />Only negative is, for me at least, is that still once or twice a week I need to&#34; touch up&#34; my shaving, as it's not quite as close. Hence 4 stars rather than five.But that is a small price to pay for not having to hack your face to pieces each day<br /><br />If your still shaving with a throw away shaver than I highly recommend you change to a single blade you'll never go back<br /><br /> Edit: also don't bother with shaving cream anymore go the whole way and get a soap dish and brush, is wonderful.",3
5,"I have very short, stubby lashes. I've tried all types of mascara. I received this mascara in my Influenster VoxBox complimentary to try and review. I WILL be purchasing this!

4,"I've got three sons (youngest is about 6 months old) and the stretchmarks to prove it! I haven't been using this cream long enough to be able to remark on its effectiveness, but it does smell nice, smooths on well, and makes my skin feel soft and supple after applying.",3
4,"As I said with the roller, so far so good.  Figured it would take a while to see complete results.",3
5.0,"I have ordered and purchased so many retinol creams and this one is my absolute favorite!  Takes a few weeks for your skin to get acclimated, which is why they suggest 2x per week until your skin can tolerate.  I use this cream along with Aragon/rose hip oil to prevent over drying. I love the way my skin feels/looks.  Will reorder!",3
5,"It is difficult to find shampoo for gray hair. Clairol Shimmering Lights is the best on the market; yet, difficult for me to locate where I live. Amazon is a great source for finding this product!",3

5,The quality of the brush is really good. This brush does not shed and it picks and places colors easily. This is great for precise applications on the eye.,3

5,Love the product and the shipping time was superior!!!,3
5,very good product--great strength,3
5.0,"If there's a better product out there, I'd love to know about. This has been my go-to moisturizer / tanner for years. Not streaky. Not orangey. Not too dark. Just right. Yeah, the smell's not great but you certainly won't need to go outside to apply it.",3
5,"I bought this because I love the smell of coconut and because I've been trying to find a sunscreen for my face that doesn't leave an oily residue and that doesn't burn my eyes. This sunscreen exceeds my expectations. It goes on smooth and creamy, has a light, pleasant fragrance, does not burn my eyes. I accidentally got some a little too close to my mouth and got a taste of it and was surprised to find that it wasn't disgusting like other sunscreens I might have accidentally &#34;tasted&#34; in the past. My husband was very skeptical about its supposed non-oiliness even after I raved about it, but I got him to give it a try and now he loves it, too! I will defininitely be buying this again. Amazon seems to have the best pricing. Go, Amazon!<br /><br />UPDATE: June 2015<br />I had completely forgotten that I tried this product. I still don't remember trying this product. And yet, here is my honest review, that is no different than the review I was just about to write about this sunscreen.<br /><br />I was traveling two weeks ago and had not remembered to bring sunscreen. I purchased this sunscreen from a grocery store for like, $22 or something like that. I felt confident trying it since I love using MyChelle's Oil-Free Grapefruit Face Lotion. I am blown away, again. Even if I don't remember trying it before, my thoughts after using it exclusively for an all over sunscreen are -- it's worth the money!!!!!<br /><br />Amazing sunblock protection: I didn't get sunburned. I had no breakouts. No stinging in the eyes, no icky chemical sunscreen smell/taste that we normally associate with applying sunscreen. This sunscreen changes the way I see sunscreen. Does not leave any kind of oily film. I will not buy another sunscreen ever again. The tube is on the smaller side for a sunscreen, but the quality is such that a little goes a long way!",3
4,"Smells good, but not like the eucalyptus I am use to smelling.  I use to have a eucalyptus tree and it did not smell like this essential oil.  However, it does smell good in the diffuser and seems to be effective with clearing sinuses.  The price is certainly better than the other big name companies.",3

5,Able to do lots of designs with these pins they are light weight and dots are even and do not smear..  would buys these again.,3

5,love it it really get people attention,3
5.0,"A miracle in a jar. softest, most supple skin I've ever had. Moisten skin while shampoo in and conditioning hair, rub all over body. Wait ten minutes.

5,"I started using Eminence products about 10 months ago. Initially tried the eight greens serum, but it is almost too rich for my combination skin. Researched the Couperose serum and decided to give it a try. After 2 months, I like the way my skin feels. Late in the day, my oily areas are still controlled, and my dry areas aren't dry. Even in the harsh winter weather. A little goes a long way too.",3

5,"My hair is kinda long/medium and SUPER thick. I love using this comb after getting out of the shower. It doesn't tug on my hair, either.

5,"I have tried many BB creams, from Khiels, Clarins, Dior, to store brands, but nothing compares to Natural Face! With the olive/yellow undertones to my skin, Natural Face doesn't give me the look of a &#34;clay&#34; colored masked. Instead, it blends lightly and gives an even appearance. It's not makeup, think of it more as a tinted SPF that isn't greasy or heavy. I love it and it's worth the wait to get it from Korea!!",3

5,Ok,3
5,I love this so much. It looks awesome with my hair and it shipped really fast!,3
4,"My husband and I saw an article on this product and tried it over the weekend. We can definitely see a distinct difference. If the first treatment does not help, try it for another 3 - 4 times and you will see the difference. The lotion works to dissolve the blackheads.",3
4,"I like this oil very much but it's a little greasy for a long time and I am not a huge fan of the smell initially.  I use it as my beard needs the moisture and nutrients.  Keep up the good work, folks!",3
4,I like this tape. I use it for holding my lace front wig. I like that it stretches so therefore covers more area. It's a no shine tape so you don't have to worry about trying to conceal the glare under the lace. Best of all is the strong and the hold last up to at least two weeks. Maybe longer but I don't leave my own longer then that. It is now my new favorite tape. I will buy again.,3
5,"I love this thing, I know there are a lot of complaints about it not heating up the back but as another reviewer mentioned put the hair on the crown of your head and you won't have that problem. This works well for me, so I don't have any complaints, if it's too hot just use a towel to cover your ears and the back of your neck.",3
5,"SO easy to use, I got the brown med. one and you just put your hair in a pony tail with a pony tail band/holder, put the doughnut over it, slide the doughnut up towards the end of your pony tail, towards the ends of your hair, then just roll it down towards your pony tail band/holder/your head, and tuck your hair as you go, and then you have a bun! So easy! I hope I explained it well, it's a good purchase at a good price, thank you!",3
4,"Improved the tone and texture where I have good skin (well okay, the tone and texture was already fine, but now it's super nice!). But it wasn't very effective otherwise. There was no tingle, no burn, and on my acne and rougher skin it didn't do much of anything either. I've tried a few different methods: I exfoliated and then used it; I didn't wash my skin at all and used it; I rinsed with just a cream cleanser and used it; and I used an acne cleanser and then used it. All My skin looks fine, no real irritation or reaction. I have oily skin that is prone to acne around the edges near my hair, cheek and jaw-line. I've tried tons of products. I'd give this one an 8 out of 10. I was slightly disappointed (not going to lie, I was hoping that my face would look like a nuclear fallout zone), but pleased with the overall effect on the rest of my face. I would recommend this, but it def. did not have the same results that other people had, which happens. :) Oh, and the smell was pleasant, like... summertime and orchards or something.",3
5,This is one of the best products I've ever used in my life.  I recommend this to every woman out there.,3
5,Very nice cloths. Shipped fast. Thank you!,3
5,If you have breakouts this is one moisturizer that will not cause them. I only use it on my face but it is also soothing for minor burns.,3
5,I ordered the sponges for my night time face cleansing ritual and they work beautifully! They remove the dirt/oil from throughout the day and slightly exfoliate as well.,3
5,"I have kind of fine hair, and although I use conditioner with shampoo, I end up with tangles.  This does not weigh my hair down, but gets rid of the tangles.  Also has heat protection.  I am on my 2nd bottle and feel it has helped my ends from drying out.",3
5.0,this product is great. I have been using for over ten years. It holds up through exercise and outdoor activities without you smelling awful.,3
5,"This really does make my sparse eyebrows grow! Does take a little time - days - to start working, but then is great.",3
5,looks so real !!  I cannot wait to wear it with some sexy clothes in Vegas!!,3
5,They work very well,3
5,"My daughters and I love this lotion.  It takes a tiny bit longer to rub into your skin compared to other lotions I've used, but it's worth the extra time because it is SO moisturizing with the addition of the moroccan oil.  I also really like the fragrance.",3
5,"Exactly what I wanted out of an unscented massage oil. Makes the skin sleek, has no odor or taste (yes, I tried it to check) :)",3
5,"this is an outstanding product- glycolic products work by exfoliation- this one is strong- so it can inflame your skin at first- you should not use it every day (I don't) and watch for redness.  It completely eliminated my bumpy arms, dry skin on legs and feet.  My facialist and derm recommend glycolic products to change your skin texture. The people who had red reactions were probably not warned this can happen- but it goes away as your skin turns over.",3
4,waiting for results... and more motivation,3
5,Excellent product,3
5,I use this product on my face and it cleans your skin well without harming or drying it.  This is a age benefit over time.,3
5,Just as expected.  May favorite parfum.  Great buy.,3
5,"There's a lot of reviews complaining about the size. These are perfect for me beacuse I have small hands a skinny fingers. Most brushes are hard for me to do my eye makeup with because they are too long. The smaller brushes work great for doing eyeshadow and under eye concealer. The bigger ones are really great for applying bronzer and contouring my face.<br /><br />These brushes are really soft too,the texture feel plush and like some high end brushes I have used in the past and a fraction of the cost.",3
5,I love this scent . Very light and fresh . Great for everyday use. I first purchased it in Europe . Its definately not as cheap in Europe as it is on Ebay .,3
5,"This hand cream is really quick to get into the skin; the fragrance is so pleasant and destressing. I like to set it in the middle of our shared work area and let others use it as we work ... there is a reason it has won awards. there are other colorful/beautiful tins, too. I found it in London at first but then as I ran out I ordered online--lovely product. Now, the main thing I want to say here is that the seller is really cool. They sent samples of lovely perfumes (although I don't know the name of the one sample and wish I could order a big size of it! ... I might write to them and find out!). They also wrote a handwritten note telling me to enjoy. It's a day and age when so much is automated, e-mail, voice but no real, tangible contact. A handwritten note was just genius and unexpected. A nice touch. A nice company. Buy this product from these guys! (I ordered another tin from another company and nothing came with it ... so I'd rather cuddle up to these guys).",3
5,bought this for my gf she has braces works amazing highly recommend I use it sometimes works perfect its small but I love it,3
5,"The pictures seem to be true to color, because mine is a perfect match to my honey blonde hair. I washed it twice with soap because I get a reaction to some hair extensions. It held up perfectly and even withstood some straightening with my iron on medium-high. The shipping only took 2 weeks to get to NY.",3
4,Smells amazing fresh wild cherry. Feels good on my skin. The fragrance does not last after the shower and you will need to use a lotion after  after a few weeks I just started to see slight dying on my legs,3
5,"After OPI discontinued the Ruble for your Thoughts nail polish I was frantic to find some leftover of the product. Cheaper than retail pricing, good pkg'ing and service. Will order again as huge inventory of products.",3
5,"I used to use the whole acne.org regimen, and it worked GREAT for years. But my skin started drying out, and my dermatologist advised I should cut back to just a small (pea-sized) amount of this, twice daily. It works pretty well! I still break out here and there, but for the most part this keeps it in check amazingly well...and for CHEAP! :-)",3
5,"I wanted to get a good quality brush to do my acrylic nails. Even though I wasn't to sure of the size to get, and this one is a bit larger then I need, it is a very good quality brush.",3
5,"I love them. They're thin and think thick lashes just in the perfect places. they even come with short lashes (The bottom pair lashes) just for the center for extra volume which is AMAZING. The bands which holds the lashes are thin, which I like because it makes it look more natural. Shipping and handling was very easy, I got my package in the 4th day I ordered them.<br /><br />Very impressed and I will order more once I run out! Thank you!",3
5,I love this product I am a lipgloss fan but I brought the pink punch an I loved how smooth it made my lips I have very dry lips in the winter so when I brought this it help with the pilling of my lips it truly made a different in the way my lips feel I loved it so much I brought 5 more to me ther way better then the e.o.s lip blam for sure. 5star lip balm for ur 5star lips,3
5,Best hair oil I've found.,3
5,It was fast and just what I expected.,3
4,"Good. Works just fine as it should.<br />You get what you get, if you want something great<br />You should just get professional help.",3
5,"This is the only eye brow pencil I'll use. It has no wax, goes on like a dream, and lasts forever. The color stays true, and the pencil itself is so good, you don't have to use mass quantites.",3
5,"I was expecting these to come September 8- September 10 and I was surprised, but excited, when they came on the 6th! They look even more amazing in person I can't stop looking at them and I can't wait to wear them!",3
5,you get what you pay for...this is the best  GOD forbid this happens to you..ita not embarrassing..before you get permithrium cream sulfur soap bars 15% will also kill your bug problem...any bug,3
4,the product was good i think is worth it.... i recomend other to buy this product. i made it into a gift and she loved it..,3
5,"The dye is the longest lasting dye I've used. The only problem is that after washing it out for about an hour there was still dye left in, and it would rub off on my hands also my entire back, neck, legs, and stomach were covered in pinkish purple coloring. Not to mention my bathtub is pink now. Some advice, wash it outside with a hose, gloves, and a lot of shampoo.",3
5,"This gives the best shave for an electric shaver.  Well made and easy to use, holds a charge for a long time.",3
5,"After using Nad's Hair Removal Get, Facial Wand I would never consider using any other product!  I've tried the other waxes that you microwave and they would never get the proper consistency and seemed gooey and sticky.  To make matters worse, none of those were water soluble and it was an ordeal to clean up afterwards.  This product is very reasonable since it comes in a complete kit....with waxing strips, alcohol pads and the wand.  Once you finish with the strips, you can wash them and reuse them.  To clean any leftover gel, you just use soap and water!  The gel seems to last a long time as well....a very unique and wonderful product!",3
5.0,I've been looking for a perfect shade of grey to wear. I love this one! It goes on smooth & last long too without chipping!,3
4,😄,3
5,"HEMPZ Herbal Lip Balm is awesome, the other Lip Balms that comes close is Neutrogena Lip tube and Lipology, but Lipology is hard to come by at Ulta, who used to carry the product.",3
5,"I was looking for a natural anti-aging product to use on my face. This product is amazing. I already see it working on my fine lines. My skin feels smooth, not oily. I recommend this product to anyone wanting better skin.",3
5,Excellent,3
5,Love it,3
5,i like it and use it every day.  Would like to find an smaller size for my gym bag though.,3
5,Works good for long hair cats. Allows me to keep their coat clean and excess hair removed,3
5,"Love it, was just what I was looking for. So lightweight but powerful.",3
5,this is the second time we ordered it my family happy with it.,3
5,If this one is not an altered version of the original I bought a few days ago then this cologne smells fantastic!! I don't know how to quite express the scent it gives off but it makes an excellent fathers day gift I got it for my dad and for the small bottle i think its a descent price i bought the same size bottle for like 6 extra bucks more. I definitely recommend this to any man it smells great!,3
5,This color is so fresh and pretty. I used it on my eyes as well as on my cheeks. The combination of cool pink and warm golden undertone makes this shade the perfect blush!,3
5,"FYI, I DO NOT WORK FOR THE COMPANY. I have been using this product for over five years now and I love it. I use it and then I put on Eco Styler gel and wrap my hair with a scarf. It doesn't leave a white residue and my edges stay straight/slick the whole day and I have a natural 4B/4C hair type. I highly recommend this product.",3
5,"Love this.  I have never had any luck curling my hair with a curling iron, and worse the curls would never last when I did.  Used this and the curls not only lasted all day, but still looked not to shabby in the morning after sleeping lol.  This is so easy to use, after the two second learning curve, and it curls my hair exactly the way I want it to.  Doing the whole head took maybe 15 minutes, maybe!  And I have a lot of hair.  Worth every penny in my opinion!",3
5,"This comb is very pretty and the has quality beading (looks nice & is secure). The teeth interlock very well and better than other combs I have that are bigger. The plastic is of good strength. It is good for fine textured hair, even if there is a lot of FINE textured hair (like mine). I have this comb in other colors and wear it almost everyday. The ones I bought a year ago, still look like new.    Over several months I have purchased all the colors. The width is about 2 inches to 2.24 inches. I have a comb that is 3.5 inches in width, but this smaller comb's teeth actually lock really well compared to the bigger comb. It doesn't come undone on its own or slide out of your hair. I have lots of fine blonde hair that is silky, so it's hard for combs not to slip or be annoying in some way. It is also lightweight. It is useful for pulling the hair above the ears away from the face, but NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR MORE HAIR, especially if your hair is medium thick to thick. The crystals are not too bling bling, so it is fine for work. It can be dressed up or down.",3
5,Great and worked as described.,3
5,"These work wonderfully as dotting tools, and as a tool to reset my modem. My son is enthralled by the ribbony color bands in the handles.",3
5,"I love this plate, all the images stamp perfectly, and there are a great variety of images. Highly recommend and I will definitely be buying more plates from this series!",3
5,"This product  its  100% original excellent, I receive before expecting ... It  does the job perfectly smooth shave ..like butter ..but please don't use with cheap razor blades.",3
5.0,My favorite 💗,3
5,"It's a bit awkward to use, considering you have to connect it to a vacuum, but it really works great. It's not as harsh of my skin as I thought it might be.",3
5,"great lightweight moisturizer. lighter than cetaphil.  i use it any time of the day unless i require SPF.  The &#34;daytime&#34; version of this is actually just facial sunscreen, which you wouldnt want to wear everyday",3
5,Coats hair so it falls into ringlets thad dry beautifully.  Hair is not frizzy and doesn't have that stiff feel when it drys.,3
5,"This is the best product for gray/silver hair.<br />I've tried other products but, they don't compare.<br />It leaves my hair soft and shiny and I love the<br />comments I receive from people that I don't know.",3
5,Thank-you,3
5,Good product which seem solid and unbreakable. One thing only: the attach between the golden flower hitch sometimes in my hair so I have to be careful about that when I made my hairdo.,3
5,"Aloe Vera gel is a miracle! If you are not lucky to have the Aloe Vera plant in your house, this is the next best thing. GNC products are trustworthy and quality products. This is great for when you have a pimple or a scar you want to get rid of, or just to moisturize your hands. It's not greasy and it doesn't leave a residue.<br />You can also apply it on your face and it gives you a feeling of &#34;tightness&#34; as if you had a facial :)",3
5.0,Wow. I finally found the right product for my skin. It suites me perfectly! Really helps my skin being watery enough and not oily anymore. Feeling and smelling both are really awesome. Yeah. I'll definitely come back to get other one.,3
4,"I purchased 3 of these. Two as gifts and one for myself.  It heats up very quickly.  Great size. I gave one to my sister whom loves it. Her hair is natural straight and very thin. It's great for touch ups. As for me, I have thick wavy hair. It doesn't work so well for my hair not even for touch ups.",3
4.0,Great color! I get so many compliments everytime I wear it. It does tend to peel after four or five days which is a downer.,3
5,I bought this in black when I meant to buy it in off black. When you buy these extensions you must remember that you only get one piece. at least on this package. It came quick and I just kept the black hair just in case. It was too small of an order to return.,3
5,"This blush is beautiful. You can put in a little and have a natural flushed look, or you can billed it up to its bright color.  :) my kind of blush. I am loving it.<br /><br />Just to paint a picture for you. I have very pale skin. I am in the shade Porcelain in foundation. Brown eyes and brown hair.",3
5,This really makes my skin super soft. Did I mention it actually smells pretty good.,3
5,"I love this product. Even without lipstick, outlining my lips with a dab of gloss over it - it looks great. It seems to be neutral - a pinkish brown. Good product. Needs a pencil sharpener.",3
4,"I miss the Yardley Gimmerick paintbox that my big sister had in the swingin' sixties. By the time I was old enough to have my own, they were gone from drugstore shelves. I've looked for watercolor eye paint ever since, but nothing came close. This is one of the better eye lining paints, however. Easy to blend with a wet brush. If you but a bold line on, use a clean damp shadow brush to soften it for a smoky eye.",3
5,My daught has very thick hair and this is one of the best hair products i have bought for her that she not complained about..,3
4,"I wanted to write this review for those who have virgin hair, like myself, as I couldn't find much below. Virgin hair is undyed/unpermed hair. If you shamppo and condition regularly, your hair is fairly soft to begin with. This product works best for DAMAGED hair to repair and soften. For me, this hair mask does make my hair feel softer the day I apply it but the day after, it feels the same.<br /><br />Using this mask is simple, simply apply this product generously into your hair and comb it to even out the mask all over your head. Let it sit for 5-7 minutes (although longer wouldn't hurt). You are supposed to do this 2 times a week.<br /><br />However, I must say the smell is AMAZING. It clings to your hair faintly the next day which is a plus. If you don't like the smell, it could be easily masked with hair spray or conditioner.<br /><br />I'll update this review after using this product for a while longer. Will post if any changes happen.",3
5,"I use about two batteries every 8 days with my hearing aids, and I wear my hearing aids all day every day.  These are the best value I've found.",3
5,A little goes a long way! I thought the advised 2-3 drops were too later for my long hair so I put 6 drops and it made my hair really oily so good to know you really only need 2-3 drops which will make the product last longer.  I also tried it on my face and surprisingly it was absorbed right away with no oily feeling.  Can't wait to try it with my nails too!,3
5,Good price,3
5,I used to buy crappy drug store eyeliners but after this I will never buy any other brand again. Though I bought mine off Rakuten because when you combine multiple items and divide the shipping it's actually cheaper than Amazon. Still I would recommend this eyeliner to anyone.,3
5,"This my favorite perfume and whenever I wear it someone always wants to know \\""what perfume is that?\\"" SO light and cotton candy like with a hint of vanilla.",3
5,As the cementary of products under my bathroom sink can attest to my curls are very hard to control. But this product is amazing!! I use it as a leave in and do not need anything else. So disappointed that I can't find this in stores anymore :-(,3
5,"if you have sensitive, and want whiter teeth, this is for you. I've been using for several years, but only at night. glad to find it on amazon.",3
5,[[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]]      This product is good as i already use it. But the main thing is price. It is cheapest on amazon. really a good deal.,3
5,"I purchased three Sonicare E-series toothbrushes from Amazon. They work great, and my teeth have that cleaned-by-the-dentist clean feeling everyday! I wish they had included identifying color rings with the toothbrush (only gray ring is included by default), however I also bought [[ASIN:B002TUU5D6 The Sonic Seal for FlexCare (Pack of Blue, Frost and Pink)]] silicone covers for the brushes. They really help keep water and dirt out of the handle and the glow-in-the-dark colors are perfect for identifying each brush. I would definitely recommend this toothbrush, it is reasonably priced and with free shipping it's hard to find better value.",3
5,I absolutely love this product. The coverage is amazing! It doesn't break me out and it to does not feel heavy on the skin.,3
4,Very good product and as a guy who bites his nails alot this works. I only put on like a small little dash since that is enough for me to taste it and stop biting. I also only put a little bit because ive noticed that you start to taste it on everything like food and even in the shower if i put alot on. This is still a pretty good product though.,3
5,"I have been using this lip balm for years - and this is BY FAR the best lip balm ever made!!!  I am a complete lip balm addict and have used many different kinds over the years, always in search of the \\""ulitmate\\"" lip balm...look no futher - this is IT!!!  I have proudly converted a few a long the wy to this product and have met someone at work who feels the exact same way I do about this product!!  We say it's the best kept secret...",3
4.0,"So I know it is crazy that I spent this insane amount of money on a hair conditioner, if my husband finds out he will go crazy as he probably should!  But...I do love this conditioner, I have tried other \\""shea butter\\"" hair conditioners and this one is way better than those.  It smells and feels amazing and leaves my hair looking smooth and shiny.  But maybe I just think that because I spent so much money!  If you feel like splurging, go ahead!",3
5,"This is the best flea treatment for dogs and cats hands down!!! I have a Golden Retriver, yellow lab, and a tabby cat. I was able to treat all three with this and my flea problem was gone with in 24 hours!",3
5,I am a stay at home mom so my hands are constantly washing my hands. My knuckles are cracked and dry as a result. I even have scars on m hands from it. I have only been using it for a few days and can already tell a difference in my skin. It is fragrance free which is great for my allergy susceptible husband. It has healed almost all of the cracks in my hands in a matter of days while using it twice a day.<br />I also have keratosis pilaris. An irritating but harmless skin disorder. My 2 year old and I both have it and I can already tell a difference in my skin and in his skin. The little red bumps are already reduced by 50%.<br />Gentle enough for babies but also strong enough to heal your skin! Fantastic product.,3
5,I was so pleased to find this kohl eyeliner in brown through Amazon. My local Avon rep couldn't seem to get me one which was so disappointing  so I was thrilled to find this treasure on Amazon.,3
4,"Love it! But the cap came broken so it's hard to shut, luckily I had another lid that closed it perfectly.",3
5,"I love this bag, I received it in perfect condition and on time.  The color is a beautiful hot pink, very roomy for everything you need to put in for the weekend.  I just missed it from the store VS and I am so happy I found it here.",3

5,"I can't say just how thrilled I am to find this product! At 64 yr. and just finishing 8 rounds of CHEMO, plus I'm in gloves all day long (Dentistry) I was desperate to have some normal health back. I had tried solar oil, Studio 30 something, a'eda, & those I can&#34;t remember-but ZEVA is the answer. No Mess, Oder, and so Convenient to use home, work, or while I travel, and made in USA. BCFOG",3
5,this is one of my favorite dark cirle cover up! easy tio aopply spreads nicely and barely accumulates in soft wrinkles! will surely re order it,3
5.0,"This is a really great product. It isn't quite as thick as most masks that I've used - so you have to be somewhat careful when applying it, so it doesn't run all over the place. It begins drying pretty quickly though, so it isn't an issue for long. It feels slightly mentholated while it's on your face - I didn't find it uncomfortable at all. I also rinsed it off in the shower, which I find to be the easiest way to deal with masks.<br /><br />1 fifteen minute application completely removed all of my blackheads and left my skin tone really even. I didn't have any dryness or irritation - my skin actually felt quite a bit more moisturized afterward. Instructions say to use weekly (I'll be cheating and using it multiple times a week!)",3
5,"Sturdy, well made, fits all of my razors and brushes without an issue.",3
4,SEEMS TO BE A DIFFERENT FORMULA THAN I USUSALY BUY OVER THE COUNTER AT WALMART AND ETC.. THE PRODUCT SMELLED THE SAME BUT WAS ORANGE AND GEL LIKE IN COLOR. NORMALLY WHEN I BUY ITS A CREAMY LIGHT YELLOW.,3
5,"I love this stuff!  It is a wonderful, light, daily conditioner that works great on my fine hair without weighing it down.  I also have an extremely sensitive scalp and I haven't had any issues with the Nature's Gate Herbal Conditioner.  It has a great, herbal smell which I love - not a traditional \\""perfumey\\"" smell but a wonderful natural herbal smell - I love it!!!",3
5,"I love this mascara as it does exactly what it says.  It goes on easily and the effect of longer, lush lashes is immediate.  I look for a mascara that one doesn't have to put several coats on to get the long, full effect.  This mascara is perfect in that you don't have to put on a lot.  This means that it doesn't flake because you don't have to pile it on.  The brush being larger lets me get to those smaller lashes towards the inner corner of my eye  quite easily so that you can see lashes from corner to corner of my eye.  I love it!  Cover Girl has developed the perfect mascara bless them!",3
4.0,"I have what is called intrinsic staining (from previous antibiotic use) on my teeth. This product helps, but requires more than a single purchase to get the desired results and I still do not have that movie star 'glow in the dark' smile. Also, I had to stop use everyday as my gums were so irritated with the high amount of bleaching product. I am sure it works amazing on regular stained teeth as it has helped my smile improve in color. I will be buying again to see if I can continue to reduce staining on my bottom row of teeth. If you drink citrus products a lot, you may want to stop while bleaching as I am sure this had something to do with my extreme sensitivity to the product ( I use lemon in my water daily).",3
5,Hard to find Linden Blossom...was pleased to find it sold by this distributer.  Lovely Linden Tree scent and the solid stick and perfume that I ordered was packaged nicely with lots of bubble wrap for protection.,3
5,"This is a whitening toothpaste from France with micro-pulverized baking soda.<br />It has no fluoride.<br /><br />If you have sensitive teeth, it will absolutely make it worse after a few weeks,<br />although yes your teeth will be white.<br /><br />I switch this every few days with a fluoride toothpaste, and it works for me to control sensitivity.<br /><br />Please click if this review was helpful to you.",3
5.0,It met my expectations,3
5,Works great,3
5,"Easy to apply and lives up to all of my expectations-kiss proof, smudge proof but also easy to remove. I love it and highly recommend this product!",3
4,Thank you,3
5,"The thing about this strop is, most strops are 2 inches wide and you need to use a special technique to sharpen the average (2 1/2 inch) barber razor. This is straight up and down. Also unlike cheap strops this has smooth soft suede/canvas making it hug the blade just enough for the perfect sharpen. There is nothing about this strop that is lacking, or anything short of the perfect sharpening tool for the average size barber razor.",3
5,"Best eyeliner. It's easy to apply, doesn't smudge, and one tube lasts forever even with daily use. Can be hard to find in stores but it's the same price on Amazon (though it does take a few days to arrive...guess I'm completely spoiled by Prime..) Even though it's cheap it's as good or better than all of the expensive brands I've used.",3
4,Lighter than expected,3
5,"This is a good product.  It looks like it's pure vitamin E.  It's a bit more expensive than other products that are only part vitamin E oil, and part soybean or some other cheaper oil.  But, you get what you pay for, in this case, and no annoying fragrances have been added!",3
5,I love using this product.  I cover my face in it as I shower and wash it off when I'm done.  The oil protects my face as the steam arises and yet helps in maintaining the softness on my face--while also serving as a cleanser.  I've already ordered another bottle.,3
5.0,"This product is amazing.<br /><br />I used to spend roughly 35$ every 3 weeks to get my nails done.<br />At first I was kind of afraid to try it because I am clumsy, but I followed the instructions and it came out great.<br /><br />Some hints:<br /><br />apply A THIN layer of color ! this step is very important!!<br /><br />Overall I am extremely happy with the product. Fast delivery, as expected and easy to use!",3
5,"Make no mistake about it, this is a throwaway razor, as its' blades cannot be replaced, so you may want to order more than one.  It's intended for touch-up shaving, such as before going out for dinner after a long day at the office, or before getting off of a long international flight.  It shaves fairly close and comes with a small cleaning brush.  The razor uses two AA batteries so there are no cords to deal with.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs a small, cheap, serviceable electric razor.",3
5.0,"Very please with my whole experience and the product, will order again here!",3
5.0,"So easy to apply, worked great! I will deffinitley purchase when out in the future, but I'm sure it will last me a while.",3
5,I bought this and the conditioner. Combined it saved me almost 50% if I would have purchased the bottles at the store. Cleanses the hair and helps with oil control without drying out the hair or scalp.,3
5,"Love this, My mom uses it now as well with the Apple Cider as the mixer with me and we are hooked!!",3

5,I love this wig. Exactly as described.,3

4,"This curling iron is everything I needed it to be except I wish the on/off control was at a different location.  I occasionally turn it off while curling my hair.  That being said, it gets hotter then I even need it to be and the barrel is smooth and moves over my hair nicely.",3

5,"I have been using Old Spice since I was young.  Great product, great price.  Keeps me smelling nicely all day.  Strong but not overwhelming scent.  Plus the ladies like Old Spice.  Always have someone say how nice I smell.  Bonus for us guys.<br /><br />Put it on but it takes a bit to dry under my arms but once it does it works all day.  It is not a powder or dry at all, goes on kind of wet, so you can't be in a hurry to put on your shirt.<br /><br />I like it and use it almost every day.<br /><br />Tom",3

4,"Had to talk myself into the product because of the price,but after reading all of the reviews decided to give it a try. I will not think twice about reordering it. I did not see miraculous results instantly like many others, but after the second application my skin became baby soft, after the third noticed fine lines and wrinkles are minimizing. Mild pleasant scent adds to the \\""Spa like facial\\"".",3

5.0,I have extremely dry hands and thus is the best lotion I've found.  It is not greasy at all and hardly has a fragrance.  If I use it daily my dry skin is gone!,3
5,My friend says this product improves face's smoothness. It is useful by now.<br />It is a good product at this price.,3
5.0,"I love this stuff. I think it might even be working. I just hope it works without having to use the conditioner as it doesn't like my hair. If it keeps my hair from at least falling out as much, I will continue to buy.",3

5,"I haven't met a product yet from Burt's Bees that I didn't like. And this little gem is no exception! I am definitely acne prone, but particularly around \\""that\\"" time of the month. Anyhow, my face started breaking out pretty badly a couple of days ago and I've been using this stuff religiously. And though the acne isn't totally gone yet, the swelling and redness has decreased significantly and I can tell that the pimples are on their way out! I also highly recommend the garden tomato soap and toner along with DAILY usage of the citrus facial scrub. Simply amazing! Thanks Burt for all natural and effective products!!",3
5,"If you are looking for a night cream that provides effective moisture, ingredients that are derived from nature and are easy to pronounce, as well as a great way to lock in resilience and elasticity into your skin, then Komenuka Bijin Deep Moisture Jell \\""Night\\"" Cream is for you. Made with great things like jojoba and olive oils, as well as a shot of sake for good measure, you feel the cream work as soon as you put it on. My skin felt softer and more \\""renewed\\"" (if that makes any sense). This concoction is highly concentrated, too, so it doesn't take too much for it to be effective. In fact, a little dab will definitely take care of business. This is great for the delicate area under your eyes, too. Your epidermal wall definitely feels nourished and nurtured, without feeling greasy.",3
5,I'm in love with this product. Have looked for it for over a year and finally found it. I plan to order several more so I won't be left without it again. Its great on eczema.The essential oil fragrance is refreshing. This body wash smells fresh and clean without all the perfume scents that other body washes have. Plus it is so refreshing and energizing you get out of the shower ready to start your day on the right foot!!,3
5,"Moist, strong, and just the right size. Although it's not stated on the box, I believe it's also fragrance-free because there is no flowery or lemony scent to these wipes which is an added plus for us. My wife absolutely loves them. 100 individual sanitary wipes, well packed, and delivered early. Will purchase again for sure.",3
4,"It does go on a little greasy, but it is so moisturizing that I don't mind.  I actually like the cinnamon smell.  You only smell it when you are putting it on.",3

5,This little guy here is nice. At first I was skeptical about buying cordless trimmers but once I tried this machine out right here I was thrown. I don't do a lot of designs but I did swap out the tattoo blde for a t wide blade and this baby runs perfect...,3
5.0,AMAZING HAIR DRYER!!! Some of the attachments don't work all that great but the power of the dryer itself and the comb attachment make drying your hair as easy as brushing!,3
5,This was a gift for my father.  He was very pleased with the quality of this brush.  It's always questionable when purchasing site unseen.  We were both pleasantly suprised!,3
5,Good size and price,3
5,"great product! love my hair.. No doubt to order again, YES! Love it love it love it love this product",3
5.0,I use this to mix w/fragrance-free body wash as a natural repellant to help keep the biting insects away.  This oil is especially effective for me and I would recommend it to anyone.  Shipping was fast and order was correct.  Can't ask for anything more.,3
4,"LANCOME SOLEIL ICY TUBES IS ONE OF THE BEST SUNBLOCKS I HAVE EVER USED. IT PROTECTED MY FACE AND BODY FROM THE SUN, AND IT' S THE FIRST SUMMER MY FACE DIDN'T GO RED BUT I HAD A PERFECT TAN! IT HAS A GELLY TEXTURE WHICH IS NOT STICKY, LIKE OTHER SUNTAN OILS. BRAVO!!",3
5,Works great. Great stubble trimmer. 20 length settings up to 3/8&#34;. Long battery life. Inexpensive - this is all you need. Don't waste your cash on more expensive shavers. Nice & small so good for travel. Facial hair grows/lays in different directions so you have to shave against the grain accordingly for an even trim. Highly recommended.,3
5,Wish Clairol hadn't discontinued this product.  It's the best and hard to find.  Shipper/product perfect.,3
4,Easy To Break But Over All LoveIt 💕,3
5,Works well with my hair. I was expecting some form of fragrance but it has none so I add a few drops of one of my essential oils to it.,3
4,"I've been using this product for a long time now. I like it - it goes on smooth and has even coverage. It does not cause me to break out. The one negative is that it does tend to settle a bit into my wrinkles - not too bad but a little bit. When I turned 40, I thought I'd better stop buying this lower cost make up and start going to a more expensive brand. I went to Merle Norman and had an expert recommend foundation that I paid over $50 for. I used it and thought I liked it at first (probably not wanting to admit I wasted $50). I started really feeling like my age was showing on my face because it had taken a turn for the worse. One day I ran out of the Merle Norman foundation and found an old bottle of this. When I put it on, I thought, &#34;You've got to be kidding. This looks SO MUCH better. I don't care what age I am, if it works, it works!&#34; I've been using it ever since. I buy on amazon partly because this color is usually sold out at the local box stores. I must not be the only one who likes this color and this product!!!",3
5,I have used this product for at least 4 years now and love it.  Great coverage and color.,3
4,"I had one of these exact same curlers for a few years. It finally kicked the bucket, so I had to get a new one.  Couldn't find it in any of the stores.  It heats up real fast! This particular one isn't lined up exactly even, though.  One side tends to crimp part of my lashes when I do my right eye.  Other than that, it's great!",3
5,"Original Caress is my favorite body wash product, and it is not easy to find in the retail stores because it's been replaced with all the scented products. So, I appreciate that I can always find it through Amazon.",3
5,"My rotary died and after about 3 months of using nothing but blades I finally broke down and got another shaver.  It's a dream.  My face got used to it right away and it gives an excellent shave.  I only used the cleaning system once so far since the battery does charge when cleaning and I wanted to cycle the battery a few times first.  I'll probably start using it regularly after that.  If you're worried about the solution evaporating, just cap it after cleaning it.",3
5,Love it. I previously bought a cheapie one that broke easily. This is sturdy and seems to hold up well! I love that it comes with two sizes.,3
5,"So far, I love it.  Will be ordering one for my sister at Christmas!!!",3
4,These were a great bargain especially for how many you get. The ends are not completely smooth and therefore will catch your hair and pull as you put them in. I put several coats of nail polish on the tips and that has helped.,3
5,"When Colgate discontinued the very mild mint gel toothpaste that I'd used for over 10 years I went on a search for a replacement. When I found this vanilla mint it was perfect! Most toothpaste out there is so strong it will knock-your-socks-off. The vanilla mint has a very pleasant mild mint flavor.<br /><br />I have been buying this toothpaste since it first was introduced. I've always found it in the supermarket or at Target. In the last couple of months I can't find it anywhere. I went to the Crest website to see if it was discontinued and found that Amazon sold it. It was a nice surprise and I bought 12 tubes.<br /><br />I don't know much about marketing but I can't figure out why I can't buy this toothpaste in the store any longer. After reading other reviews I see I'm not alone. It seems unlikely that ALL the retailers mentioned in these reviews have decided to stop carrying this product. This must be something the Crest company is doing.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm glad I can get it here - for as long as it lasts.",3
5,Stamp well,3
5,"I have had a problem with wipes being so irritating and burning.  These are superb.  They are a little expensive, but I believe they are worth it.  They used to sell them in individual packs, but due to loss of sales, they stopped.  I guess I could wrap some in foil and baggies for travel if I had to.  Anything to keep fresh and feel clean.",3
5,"I bought this headband for the little girl who is 5 years old. The headband is very cute and she loves it. It doesn't pinch her head and is easy to get on and off. We both love how it is reversible (I like the pink with white spotted side better) and it is pretty easy to spot clean. Most importantly, she hasn't complained about it being uncomfortable.",3
5,good,3
4,"Sure, it's pricey. But it's a much safer alternative to the other spray sunscreens out there (the aerosol Neutrogena, Coppertone, etc.).  Since I made the decision to look for safer skincare products for my kids, I've had to turn a blind eye to price and just bite the bullet and buy what's best for my kids.  I like this spray because it's very easy to apply, virtually vanishes into the skin without any residue, and has no strong odor.  It's convenient and easy to reapply.  The little bottles are nice and portable.  But honestly, I can't vouch for its effectiveness, since my kids tan through any sunblock you apply to them.  But at least they've never burned.",3
4,"I was not too happy with my shaving experience with a synthetic brush and began scouring the net in search for something better. I discovered the benefits of the badger hair brush and bought this particular based on the price point and reviews on amazon. I have to say I am not disappointed at all. The brush did shed a few hair the first couple of times I used it, but since then it has been good. Provides a good shave and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to check if the badger haired brushes are for them. Once you are satisfied maybe you can go for fancier ones.",3
5,Love this shampoo! Make great lather and smells good! Would recommend highly!,3
5,I love it. I love how it keeps all of my stuff organized and for a great price too that is a bonus!,3
5,A very nice fragrance better and more vibrant or fresher and cleaner than the regular Flower by Kenzo in my opinion.,3
5.0,excelente,3
5,"Outstanding product. Love the small pocket where you can slip in a bar of soap. Perfect length for scrubbing your back., Highly recommend!",3
5,These work perfect in my tanning bed.  Glad I ordered them from Master Tanning Company they were very affordable as well!,3
4,"I never wake up at night with a need to urinate at home but when camping, I almost always do.  Probably because I'm much more apt to partake liberally of alcohol when I camp.  For whatever reason, I have come to treasure my Uribag.  It folds down to nearly nothing which is a very good thing.  When nature calls, I only have to roll over on my side, position the uribag, and let fly.  Instant relief without getting dressed, putting on shoes or any of that stuff.  Indispensable.<br /><br />Four stars because it would be better with a screw-on cap.  Have not had an issue so far, but I always set it OUTSIDE THE TENT when it's full because I don't completely trust the cap.",3
5,I bought this months ago and still have some!! Very good for body acne would defiantly reccomend,3
5.0,"I bought this set as a gift for my sister, and she loved it so much I bought it for myself.  Most of the scents are subtlly fragrant without being overly powering.  For such a small size they do last a long time as well.  They make a thoughtful gift for others as well as a nice reward for oneself. After using them I was able to determine which scents are my favorite and I have purchased full-size bars of some of the fragrances as well.",3
5,Love this product leave my hair smooth and smelling great I also use it as a detagler doesn't leave my hair oily Ike other product that I've used,3
5,"As a woman in her mid-twenties, I've refrained from wearing eye make-up for over ten years. Why? It's simple... EVERYTHING burned! Hypoallergenic my a... So, yeah, I just recently started doing research on the best eyeliner out there for EXTREMELY sensitive eyes. What's better? Kohl pencils? Liquid? Gel? Shadow? Pixie dust? Afterwards, I ended up researching brands from the expensive (e.g. Clinique, Urban Decay, MAC, etc.) to cheaper drugstore ones (e.g. L'Oreal, Maybelline, Physicians Formula, etc.). After hours upon hours of watching YouTube review videos (perhaps a couple hours dedicated to funny \\""fail\\"" videos) and reading online reviews, I finally decided to chance it all and try the PF gel cream liner.<br /><br />I've struck gold, people... Gold, I say!<br /><br />First of all (most importantly), it didn't burn my eyes (even when applied to the waterline. YAY!). Second, it was sooooo easy to apply (I don't have the steadiest of hands). And third (the cake in my book), it didn't smudge! Ah, a triad of greatness. I'm so happy, I could cry.<br /><br />Needless to say, I'm completely sold on PF and will definitely buy more of their products. It's that awesome.",3
4,"sounds great, but i still didn't use it, it is for father's day gift. hope next time can company with some head for exchange easily.",3
5,Great,3
4,It has a different taste but not bad.  I don't know if it works well or not but I'm using it to see if it is.  I try to take care of my teeth because I don't want dentures.  It's doesn't taste like Aqua Fresh which I normally use.,3
5,Great for dry skin and smells great,3
5,"I was using Tarte Amazonian Clay powder, but I am now on a budget and needed to spend a little less on my makeup.  However I didn't want to buy the chemical filled stuff from the drug store.  This powder was $15.00 cheaper than my Tarte powder.  I already owned (and loved) Ecco Bella lipstick, so I thought I'd give the powder a try.  In Tarte, I am &#34;light beige&#34;.  In Ecco Bella, after checking out the colors on the website, I ordered the &#34;pale.&#34;  I have lighter skin, not super white, some pink undertones.  Pale is the perfect shade and I think the ingredients are more natural than my other more expensive makeup.  Yay!",3
4,i received a free sample of this tooth paste and it was great left my mouth really clean. will buy this product in the future,3
5,I just love Schwarzkopf product.I have been using this product since 2 years and I am very happy with its quality.,3
5,Needed a simple lubricant eye ointment to control itchy eyelids....that weren't associated with<br />disease or infection.<br /><br />Did the job and did not add medication to the eye area which was my goal!,3
5,The hairspray is just like what you buy at the beauty supply.  The quality is the same. It was convenient to have it shipped rather than driving .  The price was good too.,3
4,Why was this fabulous product discontinued?  It's the only thing that works on my granddaughter's hair.,3
5.0,I love the CND brand for base and top coats.  I am experimenting a little with other gel brands for color but so far I like the CND brand the best for base and top.  It seems they are easier to remove and protect my gel/shellac manicures well.  Usually lasts between 10 to 14 days.,3
4,"I have been using this or comparable brands for 25 years. I started using before I had any major hair loss and my hair density has remained the same. If you are already starting to have significant hair loss, I don't think this will give you a miracle.",3
5,"Quick & easy. I don't need to shave as much anymore & easy to clean. My skin is smoother & has a better appearance. It is like a large tweezer, so if u can't stand the pain of tweeting or waxing, then stick to the razor. Beauty is pain.",3

5,"I'm a 23 year old male who wanted a hair dryer to dry my feet after showering to prevent athletes foot (as reccommend by my podiatrist). I simply wanted something powerful and long lasting, I don't know what the attachments are for and have not used them.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. It is powerful, in 2 months has shown no signs of faltering.<br />2. It has two settings for heat (hot and warm) and two settings for strength (high and low). Plus a Cool setting that feels nice after getting all steamy.<br />3. On the highest setting it drys my feet very quickly. I enjoy it so much that i'll use it on the rest of my body where a towel can't seem to wick away the last bits of moisture.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />None really, I can see this drying out your scalp if you don't set it on a lower setting, but I imagine any hair dryer could do that.",3
4.0,good stuff!!,3
5,"I found that this Crest Sensitivity Treatment was better than Sensodyne, especially when my teeth were already aching from hot or cold or some other irritant. The Crest toothpaste helped to dull the ache as soon as I used it.",3

5.0,Excellent product! Love it! And the customer service was great!,3
5,"Great product, but took much to long to get here so I had to give my doggie Benedryl in the meantime.  I like that it is completely natural eliminating concerns about safety.",3
5,I have very thick hair that always frizzies no matter what. Been tired of using the same ole cheap straightener for Walmart that I get about once a year. Researched this brand and found great reviews. Seemed like a great deal with the freebies included. And I don't regret it one bit! It's smaller than the one I normally get which has a 2 inch straightener. This one is 1 inch. It was much smaller than used to but I am still Getting used to it. You can get under your hair real well with it being smaller and seems to straighten better that way. love it! And it was a great price on amazon,3
5,"This is a good Product , I liked it !",3
5,"I have been using this color for years. It is a soft, subtle pink that has a surprising color payoff. I typically apply a gloss on top of this which give a beautiful effect. This has been a beauty staple for many years and as long as I can continue to find it, it will remain so.",3
5,"Unfortunately, this particular brand of hair color is discontinued from L'Oreal and the only place that offers it for sale are outlet stores.  It is the best hair color I have ever used and truly makes your hair look natural with highlights in the right places.  It also covers gray hair beautifully, leaves your hair feeling soft and manageable, and enhances shine.  I strongly recommend this product.  I have even contacted L'Oreal and requested they start manufacturing this product once again for retail sale.  Hopefully they will consider my plea.",3
5,"I'm a big Pureology fan.  I use the Strength Cure shampoo and conditioner and really love them.  They leave my hair soft, silky and shiny.  But then, when I was shopping at Ulta, I noticed that this formula was for hair that has been lightened four or more levels.  I've recently had balayage done with bleach (with Olaplex thank heavens!) so my hair has been more abused than usual.  This seemed like the perfect fit.  I wouldn't be giving up the conditioning power of Strength Cure, which is also sulfate free and for &#34;micro scarred&#34; hair.  And I like the P4P formula as well as Strength Cure, maybe better.  It gives me beautifully soft, silky, shiny hair that responds very well to my styling efforts.  I have a good hair day every time I use Pureology products.  And I love the way they smell.  Expensive, yes, but well worth it.  When my hair looks terrific I feel like a million bucks, lol!  I also use the P4P Cool Blond Enhancing Treatment mask, which neutralizes the ugly yellow tones in my neutral blond hair.  It also leaves my hair healthy looking and super shiny.  All the Pureology products I've tried have been excellent.  I have a hall closet full of hair product FAILS that I have wasted countless dollars on that now just gather dust, so I don't feel the least bit uneasy about spending more for products that actually live up to their claims. And Pureology products definitely do.  My hair hasn't felt or looked this good since before I started coloring it (many, many moons ago I'm afraid).  I have a considerable amount of gray hair which is much more coarse and wiry than the rest of my medium/fine hair and these products work well enough to tame those tresses into submission (even though they've been colored over, they're still a different texture).  P4P is very hydrating so I don't think it's suitable for fine hair.  Instead, I recommend Strength Cure, which is lighter but is still sulfate free and therefore color safe.  I'm extremely happy with the Pureology products I've tried and will continue to use them.  I don't think there's anything better on the market.  While at first glance the small bottles look very expensive, it only takes a small amount because they're so concentrated.  I use about two teaspoons of shampoo and the same amount of conditioner for my shoulder length hair.  So these bottles last much longer than you might think.  I'm pretty sure I paid $27.50 for the shampoo and $29.50 for the conditioner at Ulta but Amazon often has better deals. If you're thinking of trying Pureology P4P, and your hair has been lightened considerably, I urge you to take the plunge and try them.  There's nothing else quite like them.  You will absolutely love your hair, I promise.  I highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner (and the toning treatment).products I've tried and will continue to use them.

5,Love this toothpaste,3
5,"I FREAKIN LOVE this brush set. the price is VERY affordable compared to mac brushes, sigma brushes, and sedona lace brushes. They came so early i was really impressed! Their super soft and work amazingly!!!! I highly highly recommend these they're are very high quality brushes. They don't shed and they're very sturdy! :)",3
5,"I really am not one to write reviews but I am over the moon about this product. I love the way my skin feels after I use it. I first bought the product after it was used at a facial I received in spa. The smell was so enticing that I asked the esthetician what it was and if it was possible for me to purchase....LUCKY ME! I bought one and when I started running low I went online in hopes I could find...leave it up to Amazon...never disappoints...it was at my front door within the week. So happy! Now about the product....have to be honest that my skin was a little irritated the first time I used at home, but the second time I only left for 3 min rather than 5. Its not too abrasive and goes on smoothly. I pair with the Beech tree & Ginseng moisturizer....also a winner.",3
5,Oh so wonderful! It's healthy and clean gets a 0 on the think dirty cosmetic app!,3
5,Great product.i definetly would recommend this product.Most zegna deodorants are considered to be tops in their category.Other products create discomfort.,3
5,Good product and very fast product.,3
5.0,"Nice remover, super easy on your eyes. Not greasy. I am a fan :)",3
5,I bought these 10 Myo Brights Pigmented Eyeshadows first because of the reviews and second to fulfill my makeup kit and have pigment colors to experiment with I had never heard of this label until Amazon I was skeptical about them but LORD these eyeshadows are also underrated. First of all the packaging was Excellent and the shipping was sooooo fast. When I got them and seen them these colora look exactly the way they are displayed so bright. And lovely! And if you use contact solution they turn into eyeliners and are very very bright and intensed used with a lil water or fix plus. I absolutely love them so I ordered the other 3 color sets also. LUV LUV LUV This!,3
4,"I wrote an earlier review stating pump not working  well.  I transferred to a smaller misting bottle.  I was offered a return/refund, but chose not to do that.  I love the honeysuckle scent.",3
5,"Only the third shaver I've owned but by far is the best. Single charge lasts all week. Closer shave than any shaver I've owned before. It is a little louder than my other shavers, and I've seen that it's been complained about. But unless you really care about it, I can't reduce the ratings. FIVE STARS!",3
5,Never disappointed with their merchandise . Excellent quality.,3
5,"Excellent, but a little pricey!!!!",3
5,I'm so glad I can get this product on line. I really like the texture and fragrance of this product. Will continue using it.,3
5,I get overwhelmed in the nail polish aisle... this collection has pretty much every color I'm looking for in one kit.  Definite plus!!,3
5,"Among the amazing things I received complimentary from influenster in my voxbox, was the va va vivid facial cleansing system and the shine be gone facial cleansing product. I absolutely love it. It makes your skin very soft and shone free. The cleansing system can be used with a number of different Olay cleansers to specifically target your problem areas. Definitely a must have.",3
5,"I Recieved this product free from Influenster, Hands Down this was the best mascara i have ever used, i love it! it gives me full eyelashes and doesn't look clumply, the only downside is that it takes a little while to dry.",3
5,I use this under my nose every night. I sleep like a baby. This oil gives you peaceful dreams and relaxation.,3
5,It's only $40 at macys.,3
5,not the best quality but for the price are ok,3
5,"These were great, I was just going to try them, but now I love it. Ill defiantly get more soon.",3
5,"Used to use this many years ago and decided to get this for a change, my faviort is bijan for men but this is a nice change !!",3
5,"Love this razor!! Close, smooth shave and no razor burn! Will be purchasing this in the near future! Thank you Gillette for my free sample! :)",3
4,"The first time I had this product used on my hair was at my stylist's salon.  I usually don't like oil in the hair as it tends to weigh my hair down.  This stuff has the perfect amount of light moisture. I find it better than Moroccan oil. My stylist worked it through my wet hair, and then she blew it out.  Beautiful result.  Just the right amount of sheen, but not too oily, and my style held for several days until I washed it out.  I live near the desert and my hair, nails and skin get dry quickly; this is a perfect solution.",3
5,"I cut hair at home for my family and this unit is a professional grade clipper. I've had it for a few years now, and it doesn't require maintenance for regular home use. Great clippers!",3
5,I LOVE THIS ORGANIC ARGAN OIL!!!  Very nice....not oily I use it on my face after cleansing and on my hair it creates such a wonderful sheen and is wonderful for my dry hands!! &quot;I love this argan oil and it does wonders for my hair and skin!!! &quot; I will ONLY purchase it from Aria Starr Beauty.....a great company to do business with!!  &quot;Thank you Aria!,3
4,It's wonderful...I use it daily with my Bodishape cellulite cream!,3
5,☺️👏🏻,3
4.0,"I had the opportunity to try out Secret Outlast Clear Gel Antiperspirant complimentary from BzzAgent.  I found that this antiperspirant did what it said it would.  Secret Outlast's gel glides on smoothly and dries quickly under a couple of minutes.  I wore it when i was wearing black clothing, and it did not leave any white residue marks.  Overall, I liked the product and would recommend to anyone, whether you live an active lifestyle of just want a good antiperspirant, I think that this product is effective.",3
5,I bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it. He loves it so much that he travels with it!,3
5.0,"love this soap! i have really bad eczema around my nose since i was a kid and have felt the painful everyday peeling, as if i had a sunburn every single day of my life! i tried many things, ridiculous things, home remedy things, nothing worked!! i finally discovered black soap that worked great for a few month's, but then became super drying to my face. finally after more research, i read about goat's milk soap. i first tried homemade soap off of ebay, but it was too expensive and the bars were too small and finished way too fast. i read the reviews on this particular brand and decided to give it a try and i'm so glad i did!!  the area around my nose still peels on occasion when i don't drink enough water or the weather is too dry, but this soap has worked miracles when it comes to my peeling condition. doesn't over dry my face or body and it leaves my skin feeling clean.",3
5,My wife loves this stuff. I find the fragrance pleasant but she is the user. You can't go wrong in my limited experience giving a gift of a Burt's Bees product.,3
5,"A wonderful lternative to the US brands filled with chemicals and sweeteners. Also, no cnaker or mouth sores in years of use.",3
4,Excelent product for the price!  The first two nights I found it a little scratchy around the edges.  I flipped it backwards which took a little work to do. Feels much better this way.,3
5.0,Glad to find these without having to buy a bottle....wanted to save a little but still have the fragrance!,3
5,"A good friend gave me this shower mousse as I gift.  The lather, the scent, the way it cleans your skin - all wonderful.  Very disappointed it is no longer on the market.",3
4,"This deodorant works fine, smells alright- not my favorite.",3
5,very happy and much less expensive than through the beauty supplier -,3
5,Got these for my husband....he uses them like crazy!,3
5,So happy to have found this!  I haven't had this scent in years- and no clue what some of the reviewers are moaning about- smells just like it would from the mall (if it wasn't discontinued!),3
5.0,Possibly order again!,3
5,Great product. Unavailable in stores. Fast Service and Great Price.,3
5,"i am using this product more than year, it works perfects, cleans fantastic, high quality, once i drop it but nothing happend, stil works well :)",3
5,I always get compliments when I wear it. It does not take a lot and the scent does last till you wash it off!,3
5,"This product has so many uses. I have used this product on my hair, a sunburn,  my nails, and on my feet.  I LOVE it. It is Organic and does not leave my skin greasy. I also like the fact that it is clear and odorless. It will be great for adding essential oils. The oil was packaged really well with a plastic plug and cap to keep it from spilling during shipping. They were both easy to remove to allow for the screw in the pump. Im happy to be able to review this product and give my honest opinion.",3
5,"I have been using this massage lotion for many years and it is my lotion of choice for my massage practice.  I have always prefered massage lotion rather than massage oil and I like the consistancy of this product.  I also like the fact that this is an organic product and has no scent because many of my clients are allergic to various scents.  That way I can add essential oils to the lotion if need be.  After more than 17 years of practice, I cannot imagine using anything else.",3
4,Got this for my daughter. She loved it. Shipped fast too. Got about 5-7 days after ordering.,3
4,"I like the assortment offered for these. Some good ones, some others I have never heard of. Feather ended up being the one I ordered more off since ol' iron beard here would dull the others in a shave or two.",3
5,"This is one of the only moisturizers that seems to sufficiently moisturize my skin. It's gentle enough that I'm even able to use it on my face. I've even been able to convert my wife over to using this lotion!<br /><br />My only complaint is that, although it's unfragranced, it does smell a little \\""different\\"" when you first put the lotion on. However, this smell quickly dissipates.",3
5,its very red but exactly the effect we wanted. Fast delivery and good quality,3
5,"I wasn't impressed by any of the &#34;Garnier&#34; overnight creams, but this one was the only one that really absorbed well. Smells fresher than the others too!",3
5,"RE: Remington HC5550AM Professional Cord/cordless Rechargeable Beard Trimmer and Haircut Kit with Turbo Boost.<br /><br />I ordered and received this kit in a timely manner but, soon after I began using it I felt that the one attachment that came with the unit was limiting, I could only cut my hair at one length. I went online to order additional attachment(s) and discovered the were 2 or 3 other attachments included in the kit. I guess they were just not packaged when shipped. But Amazon saved the day. I called to report and request the missing parts. I had all the parts in my hands in two days - no hassle, just excellent customer service on the part of Amazon.<br /><br />Oh yeah, the trimmer works very well and I really like the cordless operation aspect - but without excellent customer service, you got nothing.<br /><br />Thanks again Amazon.",3
5,"This fragrance is very light, feminine. If you love to use a fragrance without being overwhelming - this it the one.",3
5,Yes the name is bad.  Yes the product is fantastic.  I heard about this on a youtube makeup guru video and decided to give it a try.  Works wonders to get rid of unwanted facial hair and to trim up your eyebrows.  Waxing and creams were so painful to my sensitive skin I had to find another way and I haven't had a problem with these.  Got an extra pack for my mother and she loves them as well.  Each razor lasts a good while so a pack of 3 at this price is a steal.  I just wish I could find them in stores.,3
5,beautiful stand. Not cheaply made. Nice heavy weight and high shine.,3
5,"Good product. Don't go cheap on your hear, use the best products available.",3
5,This liquid eyeliner is a must-have for make up bags. It is a very good price and the quality is there; will buy more.,3
5,I have been using this product for years and was delighted to find out I could buy it through amazon.com.  It is much easier since you already have the information I have to give to other vendors and I am sure of fast delivery.,3
5,"I have a large D&B hobo type bag and without an organizer it's just a big mess, I can't find a thing. The purse itself only has 3 pockets on it, not nearly enough. Now with this awesome organizer there is a spot for everything and it's transformed my purse. If my bag was any smaller this wouldn't fit - so pay attention to the dimensions, it is large. But for my D&B it fits perfectly. And the quality and amount of pockets is great. Very fair price and good quality - highly recommend!",3
5,"Te transporta a una mañana fresca, llena de energía! Te sientes radiante, con un olor a cítricos que encanta!!Si te gustan los perfumes cítricos este te va a encartar! Este perfume asienta muy bien en el día, no es fuerte, pero perdura todo el día.",3
5,"This mousse isn't like any other mousse I use before, it's really light so if your hair is straighten and you are a natural like myself. Your hair won't go back to its natural state.<br /><br />I will recommend to anyone.",3
4,"Writer (D.E. Smith) has been using this product close 2 35+ years, the problem is I use 2 buy this @ Macy's who<br />no longer carry's this product.  This is why-writer started ordering on line. As long as I find it when needed I will<br />keep ordering this product.",3
5,"I am a big fan of Bare Minerals makeup and so I wanted to give a try to this lip balm. I decided to replace my old Chapstick with this one and I love it. You can certainly tell the difference. The texture of this lip balm is more creamy and less oily, and it lasts longer on the lips. I have also noticed that my lips have gotten very thankful over the use of this product. My lips no longer get as dry as before and therefore they don't break, which used to happen to me a lot, specially right on the middle, that being very painful. Also, since the product stays on longer than others that I have tried, I no longer find myself applying it over and over through the day.",3
5,I am very pleased with the quality and looks of both hair pins.<br />Very vivid colors. Strong and sturdy for  the thickest hair.,3
5,"I have no words. These are truly a must have. I like to do a lot of the vintage pin up hair and these give you that look in literally minutes. They are super easy to use, they heat up in just 5 seconds, and they come with a large variety of sizes. The best I've ever used. No complaints what-so-ever.",3
4,I chose this rating because I like it but there really is nothing special about this curling iron that would separate it over any others in my opinion. It works as desired and gets the job done and Hot Tools curling irons seem to last years! My last one I bought 9 years ago and just finally replaced it because it was coated in hairspray from many years of use. Great product at a great price!,3
5,My daughter introduced me to this scent.  It is very soft unique scent which gets lots of compliments.  I am prone to headaches and love the fact that I can wear this perfume without triggering a headache.,3
5,"It was a good buy, shipping was reasonable, and it works very well on my dry hands. One and a half pounds of shea butter should last a long time.",3
4,"What can I say- it keeps the razor clean, which helps reduce my razor burn and breakouts after shaving. It also seems to help extend the life of the razor heads. Shiny.",3
5,"I am a very dissatisfied customer. I have purchased this hair thinking that it's a good deal and the price was good for the hair quality i would be receiving, but i was awfully wrong. The picture of the hair is very misleading to buyers. As you can see in the picture the hair is braided, which resembles quality..This is not what I have received. The hair i have received is the brand Black Magic, where I can get at my local beauty supply store for a much cheaper price of $0.99. Black Magic hair is very cheap and poor quality, that is why is it priced so cheaply. Also, shipping was very expensive. I am trying to work with a return and refund with the hair I've received, I have to pay for shipping cost. Overall, this hair was a complete waste of money and I wished I never came across this AD. NOT RECOMMENDED.5 stars is misleading btw.",3
5.0,"For me, this does seem to work a little more quickly than other benzoyl peroxide formulations. I think the reason is that the benzoyl peroxide \\""powder\\"" is more finely ground in this than in other similar medications I've used. This allows it to penetrate the pores better, which may explain why it seems to act both more rapidly and more effectively than other such creams. I recommend this product for those reasons.",3
5,I like this product because of the amount of glycerin it has. It seals in moisture without being oily and blocking my pores. I use after a light moisturizer as a sealer. No zits. Also works great for chapped hands and feet but again I like to use a light lotion first and then seal with this heavier cream. A little bit goes a long way. No fragrance. No alcohol to dry your skin out. Great product that I've been using for years. It doesn't have sunscreen so you will need to use another product for that.,3
5,"My hair gets really frizzy, especially in humid weather. Poppy Austin Argan Oil kept the frizz under control, even on a rainy day.<br /><br />I also applied the oil to my chin where I felt a pimple coming on. I was skeptical because it seems counterintuitive to add oil to oily skin. Next day, no signs of a pimple.<br /><br />Expensive, but worth it!",3
5,This dry cleanser works perfectly for those in-between-shampooing days -- it freshens and lifts my fine hair.  I recommend it!,3
5,"Having tried the Radius toothbrush from my local health food store, I thought that no one made a larger toothbrush until I came across this french deal. Once you adjust to holding your mouth a little wider, it really is like riding a bike. But be sure to note that the word soft in the Elgydium Classic Toothbrush Soft is part of the toothbrush name, and so this is actually a medium firm brush. Good firm product that feels and cleans like a truly great quality toothbrush.",3
5,nice bracelet.really like it,3
5,"My wife asked for this, and she was pleased with the purchase. It seemed rather expensive and we both almost passed it up. It wasn't the everyday item, that is for sure.",3
5,Exellente!,3
5,"My experiment was a success!<br /><br />I ate like a pig and took two Benecol chews a day and ate oatmeal intermittently. Unlike my experiment with Colest Off I made no  attempt to be a vegetarian. The results were still promising and show that the Benecol Chews are a potent force in lowering Total Cholesterol.<br /><br />My Total Cholesterol with no supplements and no diet change is a scary 287, with Colest Off and a partial vegetarian diet my total cholesterol  is about 197 with a good ratio of HDL to LDL. The Benecol Chews reduced my total to an unimpressive 237, but considering that I ate high cholesterol foods this shows the potency of plant STANOLs.[[ASIN:B000CD0W8U CholestOff 240 cplts]]",3
5,I really like these brushes. They do the job. They have a nice design and I like the fact that they are double-sided and come in different sizes.,3
5.0,"Gets rid of ingrown hairs.  Since using this product, I have none!",3
5,"I've been searching for a body butter for men, that is unscented and provides a moisture barrier without being greasy.  This product is amazing!  It's a much smaller tub than I envisioned (typical tubs are 16 ounces), but it's highly concentrated.  I have some seborrhea this time of year, and always seem to have some dry skin issues...and I'm sensitive to a lot of chemicals in other products.  This is soothing, not greasy, and goes on very well.  I'd recommend you apply when you are still a little wet, as the product is very thick and needs the moisture to emulsify and spread/apply properly.  A little goes a long way.",3
4,"Great on customer service! Fast delivery! I would buy from him again! :) on the product, I have been using it for couple days now and I've seen a difference! I'm loving the product! :)",3
4.0,works fine. i wish it had a little more flexibility but it does the job.,3
5.0,"Totally love, love, love this shea butter. It's so rich and creamy. I melted it down and mixed it with other oils, then whipped it to a fluffy mousse. Its so smooth.",3
5,"Really excellent quality, you pay for what you get. Excellent for summer days as the face creams are light and definitely keeps your face hydrated without feeling like you have layers on your face. Have bought this multiple times.",3
5,"I`ve had before wax kit but this one is different, its easy to use and even my husband liked it.:):)",3
5,Have used this product since I was a child.  It's always been my favorite.  I was pleased to find someone who carries it. Will reorder.,3
5,"Divino, gracias",3
5,This is a great brush. I use it every morning before I shower. It is good for stimulating the skin and blood vessels. My skin is smoother.,3
5,Love the product.,3
5,One of the best colors they have loves how long it stays on your lips n,3
5,These are easier to use than floss.,3
5,Thank you for the excellent service and for the follow up to make sure I am pleased.<br />I am just starting to use but like the texture and feel so am excited to see the results.<br />Thank you.,3
5,"We purchased this as a boost to our natural bug spray. However; our children are allergic to it and we had no idea. So though it is a great product, we won't be using it in our home.",3
5.0,"Psoriasis and Eczema are two skin conditions that can be difficult to control. Diet and keeping in good health are very important. This product was recommended by our dermatologist. It is not greasy and it does help. Of course, nothing cures this skin condition but products such as this keep it under control.",3
5,"My 8 year old loves these hair chalks. What is interesting is that she doesn't use them for her own hair. She uses them for her barbies hair, shampoos it out and starts again.",3
4.0,He likes it,3
5.0,I love the way it was packaged it's so an high end product. I love the fact it comes with an Serum for after the usage of mask..it's attached to the side of the package. It gave me such hydration and with the serum was even an added bonus. I will definitely order this product on a continuing bases! I LOVE IT!,3
5,I love the smell and the goodies in this shampoo. Good stuff for the scalp! The quantity is great too.,3
5,I've been looking for a professional makeup brush set for a reasonable price and this is it! These brushes will be perfect for both beauty makeup as well as theater makeup. This is a great starter kit for the aspiring artist since it has everything you need. I was very impressed that it came with a pamphlet showing the brushes and their uses as well as instructions on washing.,3
5,This flat iron is the beat one I've ever had.  I have really tight curls and this gets my hair really straight and doesn't take a long time.  The plates also heat up really fast.,3
4,I really like this conditioner. My curls come out so defined and soft. The smell is strong and stays on my hair all day long. It doesnt offend me... It will probably if you are bothered by fruity floral scents. You get a pack of 3 for a great price.,3
5,Lots of amazing scents. I will be buying more!,3
5,Totally affordable and it works! Very good deal for the money. Makes a much neater bun than any of the more expensive ones in stores as well as home-made versions.  This was a good buy!,3
5,Loved the great quality and packaging of the product!! Excellent.,3
4,"This product was very easy to apply, and I loved the conditioner that comes with it. I applied the application myself and was surprised there was no dripping and mess free.",3
5,"GET RID OF THE BRAND NAME STICKS, ETC. THIS SPRAY WILL NOT ELIMINATE SWEAT, BUT THERE IS NO ODOR...AMAZING PRODUCT!!",3
4,The knee walker worked well thru two foot surgeries.  It is much more sturdy that most other knee walkers.  The best price is on Amazon.,3
5,This is my first time using this product and I'm very satisfy with the results.,3
5,"This soap is so awesome!  Not too much moisturizer, just right.  Has cleared up some of my dry skin issues.  Great all natural.",3
5,This has been a perfect tool to help with mouth cleansing. She can bite down comfortably and the caregiver can clean her teeth more easily.,3
5,"I like this company's product. It is high quality product, and the price and quality ratio contained in the product is great. I like it",3
5,"These brushes are super soft, high quality, and work very well. I love them. I've used them daily since they arrived. I've washed them many times, and I have not had any bristles falling out. They maintain their shape and softness. I would definitely repurchase.",3
4,"It's $5.00 at Target if you want to go look at it in person. As a polish, apply it as thinly as you can because it will bubble otherwise. It also dries really fast. I've been getting about four days wear before the tips start to show wear and/or outright chipping. But I have to say that I don't do the end/underside of my nails with polish or top coat but I will start with this stuff so I can possibly eek out that fifth day of wear.",3
4,Smells good. Has an earthy lavender smell.,3
5.0,Love this cream. Nice and silkly.,3
5,I love this creamy soap because it's easy to wash off and it doesn't leave your hands feeling slimy. The color is also very pretty which is important to me since my decorative soap pumps are clear. Highly recommend.,3
5,"After reading the reviews on this product I was so excited to get it and I was not disappointed! It gets hot very quickly and generally only takes one pass over my hair to get it straight. (However, I would recommend doing sections of hair because it is a small flat iron). It is also the perfect size to make great, loose curls! I love the LED display; it makes it really easy to increase or decrease the temperature quickly. I also really love the lock feature, so that fingers and such can't get between the hot plates. After THE FIRST USE I noticed my hair was softer and smoother and I credit that to the ceramic oil-treated plates. This was a great product at a great price! I would definitely recommend it!!!",3
4,"Convenient. Does job. Very moist. Does dry a little tacky or sticky though, but not annoying enough to make me stop using them. Will reorder more once these are gone. These are very convenient to strap to my poop bad dispenser for walking my dogs and for slipping into the side pockets in my car. Convenience while performing the job is the name of the game, and this succeeds at it.",3
5,"I use this on my face with my face cream. Works great, makes my skin feel healthy. I would recommend to friends!",3
5,Excellent razor!  Very comfortable shave both with and against the grain.  A great way to save money because you won't have to spend tons of money buying multicartrige blades for those Mach 3s and other gizmo razors and it's a great razor for those who are too scared to use a straight razor.  Edwin Jagger out did themselves with this fine razor.,3
5.0,Very happy to find out just how versatile this product is. Thank you.,3
5.0,Great razor for the price. Cuts right through the minimal facial hair I am actually able to grow (21yo Male).<br />One step closer to being a man.<br />Battery lasts forever.,3
5,Bought this for my 7 year old and she loves it.  Keeps all the polish in one place and the polish is good too,3
5,"It works. But correct technique is mandatory. Works best with pressing oil and you must smooth first, or your hair will get caught in the teeth. It doesn't seem to get super hot, but it gets the job done for my hair",3
5,love it,3
5,This product is just nummy and delicious all around. It smells fresh and makes showers invigorating. Its a wonderful gentle and effective exfoliator. The oils also make your skin super soft. I would love to use this product for life.,3
5,The tube w/comb combo is much better and quicker to apply. It's  less messy and the resulting hair color is more accurate and less fake looking,3
4,"I use the Shaving Factory Apothecary mug which is very deep with Classic Brand Premium Lime scent soap .I was using a smaller badger brush with some success.  I recently received the Omega # 10098.  What a difference the additional brush and handle length makes!  I can really whip up a nice lather without constantly banging the bush handle against the sides of the mug.  If you use a deep mug like an apothecary, I highly recommend this style brush!  The Boar bristles do requires a bit more break-in but once they do you'll be satisfied!",3
5,"the product was as described and was received as promised in excellant shape, i would use this supplier again and recomend them",3
5,"I first tried this product when they were a sponsor of Ovarian Cancer Research Fund's Super Saturday event two years ago and I haven't been able to live without it since.  It does everything it's supposed to do for people who want/need to plump/thicken up their hair.  I have very straight, fine hair and spray it onto my roots when wet.  It gives me tons of volume WITHOUT STATIC.  My one word of advice would be not to use too much of it at one time and to skip a day every once in a while (like with all products) to give your hair a break.  Love this product and also love the fact that they came out to support a great cause (OCRF)!!!  A great product from a socially responsible company.  Doesn't get better than that.",3
5,Truly loved this product by L'oreal.  Can't believe it was discontinued.,3
4,"This is great to add to your makeup collection and gives the skin a nice Glow and a little shimmer too! If you want to make your highlighting stand out, add this to your make up kit now!",3
5,"I chose Bump Fighter products because my beard is thick, my skin is sensitive, and I get razor bumps when I use other products.  With Bump Fighter, I get a clean, close shave everytime--no stubble--and I get up to three or four shave out of every cartridge.",3
4.0,We ordered this soap to see if we could save a couple of dollars a bar on the soap from a popular chain store that also features shea butter and verbena scent. We have not been disappointed. Good quality and a good price. The scent and lather are comparable - if not identical - to that other store's product. We've also enjoyed some of the other scents from Pre de Provence.,3
5.0,"I bought a bleach in a store, like any brand would do i guess. The stripe ones are the strongest. This made my hair yellow before I used manic panic bleach. After applying the panic my hair was white. As blond as it gets.<br /><br />Now I play around with conditioners, grey, ice white(Virgin snow,  blueish white) purple white ect. Will dye a color soon as im bored with white :)<br /><br />Follow these steps and play around with different conditioners. Dont use strong shampoo if you want to keep the style. I use only to wash with balm on those days, im a guy so.. Might be different with long hair and stuff ;)",3
5,exactly what was expected and got to me even earlier than I expected.,3
5,Looks better in person than in the picture.  I instantly put this piece in my hair when I got it and it looks beautiful.  It is a solid piece.  Very beautiful the picture doesn't do it any justice at all!,3
4,First off the only downfall is that it does not lather but this product has provided for me a better looking face throughout the day.,3
4,"I love this coral color.  Its very similar to the picture, but definitely more of a coral than a true tangerine.  My only complaint is that the color is not very opaque and requires many coats.  This causes it to dry very slowly, often several hours before its totally set.  Very frustrating...but I love the color so much I still use it.",3
5,"Shave stand works well, and exactly as it should. Great deal for the stand overall! No complaints and fast shipping!Looks great sitting on the sink, to show everything off.",3
5,THIS IS A GREAT RODUCT AND A GREAT PRICE! I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!,3
5,"I purchased this product for use by my wife, a flight attendant for a domestic airline. She tells me that it makes the best foundation that she has ever used, and to me, she looks younger every day.",3
5,"They are very realistic looking with a nice flat edge on the lower half of the back for gluing into place.  It is actually 6 sets, not 12.  Those 6 sets are full upper and lower.  I had figured as much by the pictures in the product description so I wasn't surprised.  I will probably by another set soon.",3
4,"I was searching for a clarifying shampoo for a long time. I use other una products and gave this a shot. I am in love with this product.  I really had a clean scalp. My hair is relax and I visit the dominican salon once a week, so I know I have tons of build up in my hair. This product will be added to my hair care routine.",3
5,good,3
5,well done,3
5,DOVE Winter Care Body Wash really helps with winter's dry skin!  It is a limited edition product and I could no longer find it in my local stores.  You really should try it!,3
5,I have an artificial Christmas tree and missed the scent of a live tree until I started putting a couple Juniper Ridge Christmas Fir sachets in amongst the branches!!,3
5,"PERFECT COLORS, you don't need to spend so much elsewhere if you wear these types of colors. Enjoy, you will be happy!",3
5,"I decided to re-write my review and simplify.  My old review was too verbose, and people didn't find it helpful.<br /><br />I feel that the perfection of Clubman Virgin Island Bay Rum can best be demonstrated in a (imperfect) Haiku:<br /><br />Use Clubman Bay Rum<br />Hot women will fondle you<br />Your wife may leave you<br /><br />Consider yourself warned, and consider this amazing product at the same time.  Wonderful scent.  Your wife will love it when she smells it, but then she'll hate it as she realizes that she is no longer the only person enjoying you.<br /><br />My wife left me, tried to file a civil suit against Pinaud for ruining the marriage, but then she smelled me when I was talking to her lawyers.  She dropped the suit, and I haven't slept since.<br /><br />You're welcome.to get sniffed by random women and have quick flings, try Clubman.  If you want to meet women in the produce department and get thrown onto a sack and set onto a kitchen counter top, try Lime Sec.<br /><br />This is what other consumers have said:<br /><br />D.S.:<br />\\""Old School\\""<br /><br />Dr. S.B.:<br />\\""Oh my goodness.\\""<br /><br />W.R.:<br />\\""Accepted.\\""<br /><br />Anthony D.:<br />\\""This was by far one of the very best\\""<br /><br />W.F. Rivera:<br />\\""In Haiku\\""",3
5,"Just as others have stated in these reviews, I too have searched for many years for the right shampoo and conditioner. I cannot tell you how many high end brands ive used, only to end up disappointed. I used redken once before and it was no miracle. I decided to try one more time after seeing the description of this product. My hair is extremely thick,coarse,curly and frizzy. This product has my hair looking so normal its unbelievable! I am thrilled with the results! This product is a great buy!!!!",3
4,Bought them for my kids. They both have braces and they both say they are very easy to use.Not bad for the price.,3
5,I have been using this product for a couple of years and still like it the best.  I try others but keep going back to this one.,3
4,Love Love this perfume.  It took a while to find it.  I used it way back n the 70's and could never find it.  The only concern is that even with the lid on it seems to evaporate quickly.  Packaging arrived safe and sound.  I will be ordering more.,3
4,Excellent product that does exactly what it is supposed to do without perfume or other environmental hazards  without giant marketing costs.or mosquito attractants.,3
5,As expected,3
5,I have used this product for about 15 years.  It is by far the best detangler that does not leave your hair feeling weighed downQ,3
5,I used to purchase this item at Walgreen's but they discontinued it.  I have very short hair and this<br />product is wonderful.  So glad to have found it.,3
5.0,Will buy again. My dads favorite ( signature scent) I am so mad that marc Jacobs has discontinued this.,3
5.0,Tried a lot of other spot correctors and this one is the best. I saw improvement within two weeks. Will definitely re-order    This is the best  product for improving dark spots!!!.,3
5,Great!! The wife loves it. Works better than expected. Good price for the performance.,3
5.0,I absolutely recommend this product to every women out there. I received this as a sample from bzzagent and I'll admit I was a little skeptical about it.I've tried products like these in the past and they never give a close shave and leave your skin with horrible razor burn. But I have this product a go and I LOVE IT!!! Made the closest shave and left me with no razor bumps. And I didn't need to shave again for a week it was awesome not having to shave everyday like I use to with other razors. This product is going to  name me have one happy summer!!!,3
4,"This colour lasts forever. I got lots of compliments on it, even from girls at the salon and I dyed my hair myself. I mixed this with the blue colour as well and it makes a nice light purple. The bottle lasts a while too, I have dyed pieces of my hair with this twice and still have half the bottle.",3
5,Good soap bars.,3
5,"el producto llego en  excelentes condiciones, llego en el tiempo pactado y lleno mis expectativas sobre el producto. los recomiendo. very good",3
5,Beautiful,3
5,Good quality polish in a beautiful color.. this I why I love Essie.. no one else does pastel creams like Essie!,3
5,"Thank you. We use it for just about everything, this is a really great product! there are so many uses.",3
5,"This Shampoo works great, it might not smell the best like all the other shampoos out there but, It sure does work!! it worked for me as I had to take a Hair follicle test for BP the refinery. it Works!! but the only thing is, its not gnna work only using it a couple of times. You must use it everytime u bath for atleast 12 days and quitting any bad habit u may have as this may defeat the whole purpose",3
4,"I discovered this serum about 2 weeks ago and I love it!  I wish I could give it 4.5 stars.  It's super lightweight, there's no fragrance and it comes in a pump dispenser.  It's perfect for my breakout prone skin.  I've been using it once a day at night and my skin already feels softer.  I can't wait for them to come out with more products!!",3
4,"I gave this one to my wife to try and am reporting her impressions.  The product works well and did not cause any irritation.  After reading the label, irritation was a bit of a concern, but there was no problem with leaving it on for the entire time (6 minutes).  There is a bit of a chemically smell, but that is to be expected. It certainly does not smell very \\""rosy\\"", so that's why I didn't give it five stars.  The smell wasn't strong or particularly unpleasant and it did not linger after removal.",3
5,I always get compliments on this perfume. People comment that it really does remind them of women in French movies. I now wear nothing else.  It's part of my daily toilette.,3
5.0,"I love this Vitamin C Serum! I've been using it in conjunction with the Miracle Retinol Moisturizer and Intensive Youth Eye Gel by Radha Beauty, and the first thing I noticed was that a little goes a long way, which is a huge bonus not only for my ultra-sensitive skin but also for anyone on a budget. An advocate for daily SPF, I've been using each one of these products with my already established moisturizing regimen and there are no signs of residual oil or irritation. The quick absorption and nearly fragrance free scents leave skin feeling clean and fresh.<br />Combining vegan hyaluronic acid, organic aloe, vitamin E and green tea, the Miracle Retinol Moisturizer is definitely my favorite, but I pretty much love all their products. Wonderful!!",3
5,My favorite body scrub! The smell wakes you up in the morning and the sugar and oils make your skin silky smooth. I use it once or twice a week.,3
5,"I looooove this perfume and need to buy more. People are literally walking up to me and smelling me, even my boss complemented me! It has a nice sweet scent that I would not expect minaj too have.",3
5,"This was the best of all the Axe line, and they discontinued it. I wish they would bring it back. :(",3
5,"I love the smell of perfume on other people, but I often get headaches if I wear it myself. This fragrance does not give me a headache at all. I love it. It's feminine, but not overly floral. LOVE!!!",3
4,"LOVE this product, BUT so sad today. I have been using it for over a month and have developed an uncomfortable red armpit rash in the last few days. I am not allergic or sensitive to anything that I know of but see that some others have had reaction as well...possibly to baking soda, which I thought to be pretty benign. Anyway...I am not giving up completely, but will be stopping my use - maybe switch back to my LaVanilla for a bit to see if it goes away and try again to confirm? Ugggg.",3
5.0,Just what I wanted.,3
5,ok,3
5,"LOVE, LOVE LOVE it!!  Have had the first version for a few years but this one is so much stronger and the extra speed is great!!  I also love the face creams that it comes with",3
4,"I've used Venus razors before, first the \\""original\\"" kind and then the breeze model. I've been pretty satisfied with the breeze and been using it for a while now so when I was contacted through a Gillette-run program to try this product, I was more than happy to use it.<br /><br />This razor is definitely as advertised. Once it got wet, it was slick enough to use without any soap or shaving creme at all which was nice and convenient.<br /><br />The blades were really nice- it only took one swipe to get rid of hair. I've always had sensitive skin on the bikini zone and underarm area, to the point in getting nicks while shaving and getting red bumps the day after even when using a shaving gel specifically for sensitive skin. I noticed that even without any shaving cream/soap that I didn't have the inflamed skin the day after like I usually did.<br /><br />However, as nice as the blade was, the moisturizing strips are a little fragile- at least the one on the top. After two shaves using the razor, the top moisturizing strip had lost about a third of the starting amount, and was starting to come off the pieces where it was attached. The bottom moisturizing strip was still in good shape though. I don't know if this is because I press down too much, I do press down my index finger on the blade when I shave so that could factor in. Regardless, the fragility might mean that I have to replace the razor head before the blades even get dull.<br /><br />Over all, the pros of not getting inflamed skin and the much quicker time it took to shave were big pluses that outweigh the con of perhaps having to replace the head earlier than I would like. I would definitely recommend this product.",3
5,LOVE IT,3
4,"Allow me to preface this with two things. Firstly, Zyloo sent me this free of charge to test and review, secondly, I'm not an overly attractive man. I'm 5'10, 230 pounds with long black hair and an a-hole personality. I can't help it, it's just kind of how I've always been. I'm handsome I suppose, but not someone who stands out in the looks department, and kind of an introvert. Keep that mind when reading this review. This is a solid product. The smell  is very pleasant and it pairs well with other colognes. I like to use this as an everyday type of wear. I spritz it directly on my skin, the classic pulse points, wrists, neck, jawline, behind ears and even spray it on my neck at the base of my skull and on my exposed scalp since I have long hair. It has a great effect on friendliness,  both on yourself and those around you. It seems to ease people's apprehensions around you and make them more relaxed and engaged. It's not some magical product that will turn you into the Pied Piper of sex, but if you are a little confident and funny, at the very least women will hold a conversation with you. Where it goes from there  is on you. This is lighter than the oils so it works best with less clothing, t-shirts and shorts, you know, so the pheromones can make it into the atmosphere. I use it nearly daily and have noticed that on the days without it things just aren't quite the same, not just with those around me but with me as well. In the end it's worth every penny and will at least get your foot in the door with the ladies, which in my experience,  is the hardest part. The rest though, is up to you.",3
5.0,"Curly Sexy Hair Curling creme works fabulously!!!<br /><br />First, you have to know your hair (curls have a mind of their own) and also know how to style your mane. I've searched and bought various curling creme products yet many do not really enhance the curl. Through trail and error, I found the best method for me:<br /><br />1) Styling after I wash my hair: I use an ultra light oil/water spray called Miracle 7 then use Curly Sexy Hair creme<br /><br />2) Daily styling in-between washes: Daily conditioning then an application of Curly Sexy Hair followed by a a crispy-creme to set the curls without the crunchiness of a drying gel. Alagio worked but the I cannot find this product anymore.<br /><br />(Since Curly Sexy hair creme is hard to find in shops and salons, another hair curling product that works is Miss Jessie's Pillow Soft Curls)",3
5.0,Great  stuff for naturally curly hair!,3
5,"This brush is perfect for blending eyeshadow. NO shedding, perfect softness. Must have! wish the price was cheaper but its worth it",3
4,I don't recommend trying to fit more items in the bag than the set of bottles that comes with it. I split the zipper by doing that. Otherwise it was exactly what I needed for traveling with a carry on. No leaks!,3
5,I wasn't sure if the material would be super flimsy like other capes I've purchased online. Great material and I love the design!,3
4.0,"This produce is non sticky, non greasy, and lightweight and smells good. I've used it for years.",3
5,My afro 4c hair loves this oil. Leaves my hair soft and shiny.,3
5,"I have all the colors of these eyeshadows and I love them all. They blend out easily giving a very sophisticated soft smoked-out effect. They look very expensive on. Since they are loose, they do have a bit of a fallout so I prefer to do my face makeup after I finish my eyes, whenever I use these. The colors are simply gorgeous! I love, love, love these which is why I bought all them (also just $3 each on the ELF website!) Highly recommended!",3
4,I got this brow liner for my mother-in-law who says she can't locate this anywhere  - so she was thrilled when I gave it to her !,3
5,Met expectations. Same product as in box store.,3
5,"Sebastian has discontinued this product so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  I've used this for years; it's better than hairspray for keeping my coarse, thick hair in place.  A tube lasts for months since you only use a small amount.  I'd like to thank whoever decided to stockpile this wonderful product when it was discontinued!  Seller shipped promptly, product arrived exactly as promised.  I'm grateful to be using Threads again!",3
5,"I have used this before, and I was happy to find it on Amazon. I would recommended it to anyone that needs a really good hand cream.",3
5,"thanks so much for the opportunity to try this product.  I have not used ANEW eye cream previously, and I am pleased with the product.",3
5,"Pain, Pain, Go Away is dead sea salt infused with a blend of essential oils which provide natural relief from muscle aches & pain. Add 1/4 cup (about a lid full) to a tub of warm water & soak for at least 20 minutes. The salt grains are larger than what I normally use, but they dissolved quickly. After the salt dissolved, I was left with some particles that were floating in the bath water. I'm not sure what these were & am wondering if it was a reaction between some of the ingredients & our community well water. (I will email Vi-Tae® and update my review with their response.)<br /><br />When opened, Pain, Pain, Go Away has a strong, yet pleasant, aroma. A menthol aroma lingered for the entire 30 minute soak. I loved that. My 30 minute soak was very relaxing & provided temporary relief from the arthritic pain I was experiencing that evening.<br />(The second ingredient in these bath salts, methyl salicylate, is from the same class of chemicals as aspirin & is often used externally to help relieve the aches and pains of arthritis.)<br /><br />review sample provided",3
5,"I have a dry damaged hair and I've been using coconut oil however, it leaves my hair sticky and oily especially summer. I found this pop up store in my area carrying Korean cosmetic brands. I took a risk of buying the whole bottle that comes with a small size just like in the package. I was so happy and planning on buying this once I run out. It really moisturize my hair leaving it soft silky texture without being sticky.  I usually apply after shower when my hair is damped to maximize the moisture. It says that it will make your hair stronger as well of continue of use.",3
5,5 Blades.  Works with a recently discontinued model used to be sold through Costco. Amazon had this in inventory and I was happy it was available.,3
5,"While this soap has a very strong lemon scent it is miraculous. I use it solely for my face for oil control and it does wonders. It will dry your skin a little if you don't have extremely oily skin.<br /><br />I suggest keeping it stored out of the water oath as it can deteriorate rather quickly.<br /><br />Shipping was somewhat slow, but about average.",3
4,"Norelco's Bodygroom is not perfect, but overall performs well.  The only issues I found is the lack of charge indicator, which would be a nice feature considering the Bodygroom requires eight hours for a recharge, and the fact that the trimming attachments do not quite result in the advertised length of trimmed hair.  They definitely seem to trim a bit closer than what one would expect.  The Bodygroom is easiest to use and works best when a complete hair removal is desired.  Overall, I would recommend this product.",3
5,"glides wonderfully, very pleasant to use and NO PARABENS! YAYA! I love Biotone products but was especially impressed with this product.",3
5,"This product is far superior than all others I have used.  In the past I have used Remington Flex 360 R-5130NB, Norelco Speed 8240XL, and the Norelco Sensotouch 3D 1255x.  I battled with ingrown hairs for years with all three of these shavers .  I thought the rotary was better than foil. But, I was so wrong.  I have been using the Panasonic Arc3 (ES-LT71-S) for three days now and all the ingrowns are gone and the skin at the neck area is smooth.  All those having the same problem I had, the ES-LT71-S is the product for you. Amazing results! Awesome! Two thumbs up!",3
5,One of my favorite scents....disappointed that it is discontinued.<br /><br />Will continue to search for more.<br /><br />Perfect scent for summer but can be used all year round.,3
5,So cute just like the picture,3
5,"Its for men and women, don't let the feminine outside fool you.<br /><br />Everyone in the house uses and prefers this soap.",3
4,"Biore Combination Skin cleanser is a bit hard to describe.  It lacks lather and has a gooey texture reminiscent of moisturizing cleansers made for sensitive skin.  However, it leaves the skin feeling like it has been purged of oil... a bit dry and tight.  It makes sense that this product is for combination skin.<br /><br />If you have issues with both oily and dry areas, it is worth a try, but it might leave some areas of your skin a bit too dry and irritated without a proper moisturizer to follow it, and that can lead to acne.",3
5,"I am happy to have made this purchase. The mirror stand has a heavy bottom and the magnifying side is that sometimes difficult to find \\""10x\\"" which I require. It's the only mirror I need to do my hair, make-up and whatever. It also comes in a sturdy enough box that can and should be used for storage. (the manufacturer even reminds you that a mirror sitting out can cause a fire under certain unlucky conditions). It does come from China unfortunately, but is well made and a good value.",3
5,So happy with this product and seller! This is mom's favorite soap and mine because she is now safer in the shower!,3
5,"I wish I had taken a picture before,  I noticed more lashes by week 2.<br /> was going to give it at least 6 weeks like it says.  I will buy this again.",3
5.0,These towels are perfect for your hair.  Good quality for the price.,3
5.0,Dr recommended at an EXCELLANT price..,3
5,This product is the best for people with fine hair.  I have never tryed  anything like it.  It is worth every penny.,3
5,"Love the price, love the gentle facial brush, leaves face smooth and soft.",3
5,A very pleasant and refreshing scent for a man who likes a fragrance that is not overwhelming to his women. Smells very nice.,3
5,Love this product! Cuts shaving time in half and the price was unbeatable. Could not ask for any better results or price.,3
4,"Took a very long time-- almost a month -- to come, but it came perfectly fine and works great. You get 4 sponges. Two large and two smaller ones.",3
5.0,It's good for dry skin and it's not oily.,3
5,"This has become my go-to brush set. I can't rave enough about these. I've watched Sam and Nic's youtube videos (absolute recommend, they're a godsend for people like me who aren't very make-up savvy) and heard about them there. After reading some very positive reviews I decided to buy my own set and I couldn't be happier.<br /><br />I use the two largest brushes the most for my shadow application. The biggest one is a dream for blending. I also really love the liner brush. Unlike some other brushes I've had, these have never, ever shed on me. I couldn't recommend these any higher, especially for the price.",3
5,Lovelovelove,3
5,Perfect for dry winter skin and for eczema. I use this product as an eye cream during the day and also for my dried and eczema prone lips. Lighter than the Sweet Bee magic skin cream but equally moisturizing. I have very sensitive skin and this is the only thing I can wear as eye cream,3
4,Smells great.shipping was fast! Love it!,3
4.0,It's a good nail cleanser.  I'd use it again.,3
5,that I have ever used!  I love it and Amazon has the lowest prices.  This product is my favourite of all the Dermalogica products I have tried and great for aging mature skin.  It moisturizes and penetrates leaving your skin hydrated.  it has a bit of a medicinal smell but I like it.  The smell is not offensive.  It is without doubt the best moisturizer I have used.  When I have run out and have to use other products lying around the house feel the difference.  Totally recommend!,3
5,"I am very impressed with Suave conditioners.  I always thought, since they were so inexpensive, they must not be a quality product.  However, I have found that that is not the case.  The Suave Rainforest Fresh conditioner and the other Suave conditioner I have used actually work better than some much more expensive \\""salon\\"" brands I have tried.  This conditioner leaves my long fine hair soft, smooth, and detangled without being weighed down.  The fragrance is pleasant without being overwhelming. You really can't get a better conditioner for this price, so don't waste your money on expensive brands when this one works so well.",3
5,"The price on Amazon is half you would spend in any store, definitley worth the price, and it came within a few days.",3
4,like toppik.,3
4,It works.,3
5,"I cannot say enough good stuff about the Davines line of products. I absolutely love the way they smell. The smell is soft and feminine, and not \\""heavy\\"" like other products. I use  Volu for root boosting- it perfect for the job. I have a fine hair shaft, but a TON of hair, so my hair is easily weighed down with products. Volu produces a soft lift that is touchable. I also use Oi for glossing and control (I use it in place of mousse or gel) and it smooths my hair for the entire day. Both products leave my hair bouncy and touchable.",3
5,i own so many eyeliners. i love this one because it goes on so smoothly and doesn't smudge. great pencil liner!,3
5,Doesn't strip hair - leaves hair looking healthy but not oily,3
5.0,LOVE IT!!,3
5,"My esthetician that does waxing recommended this to me years ago, and its a must-have for folks with sensitive skin, or who develop razor-burn.  It burns slightly after a fresh shave, but will prevent and treat existing razor burn in all places on the body.",3
4.0,"I ordered this expecting the color to fade out fairly quick. For the price, it sure has lasted a long time! My only complaint is that the color was somewhat uneven after the first wash, which resulted in me coloring it a few more times. It's definitely worth the money, though!",3
5,Thanks,3
5,I absolutely love this stuff. It's the only cream I can use on my face. Everything else makes it raw and red. It has also drastically helped my fiance with his razor burn and helped soften my fingers when they started cracking from the cold weather,3
4,I am on my second bottle and like not having chemicals in my shampoo I also am using the conditioner.   It has a nice clean smell.,3
5,Great for French manicure or to put designs on top of.  I've used it two ways so far and love it!,3
5,Great product.,3
5,"I've been using this hair dryer for years, and it's perfect for wavy/curly fine hair as it doesn't blow it all over the place.  It's the ideal solution, but it does take a bit of patience and time if you're switching from your typical megawatt dryer!",3
5,"I would recommend this excellent product. Very versatile and useful for them.[[ASIN:B000G0GW6K Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver with Bikini Attachment, Mauve]]",3
5,"I get them on my fingers, especially during our dry winters - VERY painful!  This product works the best AND has little scent!",3
5,"I bought this stuff from Sephora with not little expectations since I have never found a product that didn't streak.  I figured since it was on sale I would just give it a whirl and the girl told me I could return it if I streaked.  Well I went home and after my shower put it on expecting to go to work another week with streaks.<br /><br />Well too my great surprise I had ZERO streaks, zero.  Flawless color and it was enough color to look like I got some sun (I applied it on the first nice weekend) so it looked like I got REAL sun color.  No orange, no streaks.... no super yucky smell (I still don't love the smell but its not the worst from other products).<br /><br />Seriously try this stuff!",3
5,Perfect for oily and combination skins,3
5,I would recommend this pillow.  I forget to bring mine with me for our winter home and had to buy another.  Love it!  Great neck support when folded for reading in bed.,3
5,It's good and cheap!!,3
5,Wonderful product.  Last I heard was it is being discontinued.,3
5,Love it! think and creamy but not cake-like. Keeps skin moisturized even in high altitudes like CoSpr.,3
5,Great product.,3
5.0,Very nice. Not too strong. Has lasting fragrance. Worth the price.,3
5,Sent this to my sis-in-law along with the cooling spray.  She said it really helped with the dry skin as a result of chemotherapy.  She is in Canada and was having a hard time finding anything that actually gave her relief.  Thanks CV for these products.,3
5,Keeps her hands in good shape in the winter. She's tried almost everything at one time or another and this seems to be the best.,3
5,"This product is fantastic! It smells a little odd, and at first it was off putting, but after I saw how amazing my skin looked, I could easily look past the scent. It sort of smells like a mild toasted sesame oil, which isn't bad, but just sort of weird to rub on your face. Luckily the scent dissipates within a few minutes.<br /><br />I cannot tell you how much I am in love with this product. The sample I received was fantastic and I have been raving to everyone since I got it! My skin looks younger, more dewy and fresh. Even my friends asked me what I've been doing! No more dry and rough patches, just smooth, beautiful skin.<br /><br />I wash my face a night, apply my serums and creams and then finish with a few drops of this, massaged into my face and neck. It's a very easy routine, and it feels wonderful! Great product! Must try!",3
4,"Age: 37   Skin type: Fair, sensitive   Pros: Inexpensive  Cons: Wish they had several types of pads based on different skin issues and perhaps a lower third speed for those of us with sensitive skin  Opinion: I was skeptical about the potential results prior to purchase/use and decided to go for it since it was about $20---many of the scrubs and other chemical products out there are too harsh on my skin---I certainly didn't expect a miracle for this price point but have had this for about 6 months and am impressed so far.  I use the lower setting because the high setting rattles my teeth, just as another review stated---but it still feels intense.  Due to my sensitive skin I only use this on occasion---maybe once every other week or when my skin feels really dull.  I don't press too hard or go over the same area for too long (learned this the hard way after irritating my face the first time) and it leaves my skin much smoother---over-exfoliation can cause my skin to become irritated easily so if this is how your skin is just proceed with caution.  I have received compliments on my complexion after using it, which is nice but it is really about how it makes my face feel.  Bottom line: Worth the money; use as needed for your skin type",3
5,"This is just the type of thing I was looking for!! I have a very large purse with ONE HUGE compartment! So everything that went into my purse went into multiple smaller cosmetic bags or it got lost and took forever to find! This product, especially off the price was perfect!!! So many pockets and plenty of space in the zippered compartments! Very pleased! Should've bought two!! Or three ;)",3
5,"My wife and I really liked the results we had with this product. The first thing you notice about Miraculous Mud is how very different it is from other mud mask products. Every ingredient in it occurs in nature and it is obvious when you apply it that it is completely unique and completely natural. It has a refreshing mint aroma and,  after rinsing off the mask we were amazed that our skin didn’t feel dry and tight like with other mask products. Instead it felt smooth to the touch and moisturized. It is definitely a product we will continue to use.",3
5,This is a great product! It actually fades the wrinkles. I 'm going to use this product again.,3
5,"I love this body wash for me it is the best on the market, no other bodywash comes close to this product. Whether you are young old this bodywash is a must have.",3
5,works so very well for my fine hair,3
5,"Great product, great price",3
5,Awesome,3
4.0,"I have used this product for about a month and I like it.  I have used a lower priced Braun (100 series) in combination with a Norelco Rotary Razor for years.  The Norelco did a much better job with longer whiskers that the Braun, but the Braun could give a closer shave.  The new Braun seems to replace the other two.  The battery life has been very good so far.  I only use the razor dry, so I cannot comment on using it wet.  It is a solid feeling razor that seems to be well made.  The three heads make shaving around my mouth and nose easier than the older model.  I would recommend this product.",3
5,I first used this at a bed and breakfast and fell in love with the product. It is the only lotion I use now. It is non-greasy and has a nice light smell. Wonderful!,3
5,"LOVE LOVE LOVE dead sea products, they smell awesome, they work well, and they remind me of my trip to the dead sea",3
5,"Like many others, I'll say this item works great.  The last years, I added a sonicare toothbrush, this, glide floss and a tongue sweeper pro (scraper) to the arsenal.  The combined cost is less than a single dental problem - so if they prevent anything, that's automatically money back in my pocket.  I've used Waterpiks for 3 years now, the first one died on me after the first year.  However, I used to add a cup of listerine to my first one for extra cleaning.  After some time, when I thought the water container became grungy, I rinsed it and used a paper towel to clean it out.  The paper towel came out extremely purple (same color as the water container) - it was obvious that the plastic was dissolving somehow but I thought it was just really cheap plastic or something.  This happened everytime I cleaned it.  After it died, I got a new waterpik (same model) and as an experiment I only put water into it. It's been 2 years and I never put listerine in it, and when I wipe the inside of the container, nothing smears off at all.  So, personally, I just use concentrated listerine after waterpikking and never put it in the machine itself.  I figure some of the complaints of broken machines may be traced back to this practice.  Either the dissolved gunk from the container clogs up the motor over time, or listerine has that effect on the internal plastic components as well.  Perhaps Waterpik fixed this in the meantime, seems like a glaring defect to how many people use it, but just a word of caution.  TLDR: DON'T USE MOUTHWASH IN THIS!!!  Edit: June 2012.  Second one still works after 4 years by using only water. Edit: Sept 2016.  This second machine still working.  Every so often flush it with vinegar to prevent hard water problems.  Crack has developed in hose, near base of handle, youtube has a fix for it.  Might look into Jetpik when they fix reliability issues.  This unit has served me well so far. EDIT: Spring 2017.  Machine 'died' last fall, it still functioned but the hose crack was too much work and I got a replacement instead of spending hours going to the hardware store.  It worked well when I had it.  Would recommend.  I got a chinese knockoff I doubt will last a fraction of the time just for variety.",3
5,This oil smell very nice. I love it!!!! NPS has some really good body oils and the best prices i've come across on amazon.,3
5,"I have absolutely nothing negative to say about Philips  Sonicare toothbrush. I bought the first one in 2004 and had to replace it this year. Anything that lasts 10 years, is easy to use, improves my dental health and saves me money is great in my opinion. My dental check ups improved immediately after I started using this product.",3
5,One of my favorites. Smells so good and I always get compliments. Often times it gets mistaken for one of Channels scents. Good going J.Simpson,3
5.0,"This is my favorite lip product & have been very disappointed that Burt's Bees as discontinued this color.  So, I was VERY excited to find it through Amazon at a very reasonable price.  The products were exactly as described & shipped very quickly.",3

5,I am 79 years old and my feet are tired.  Now they can join the rest of my body  and rest at night.,3
4,These work as expected and at a better price than I can get locally.,3
5,"Philosophy really nailed this one. The shower get smells just like hot dots, and makes a perfect wakeup scent for a morning shower. I've been using it since the weather turned cold in November, alternating with the Dark Chocolate scent. When I'm freezing, stepping into a hot shower with one of these makes my day. And the scent doesn't linger on your skin to interfere with perfume, it just makes your shower wonderful.",3
4,"This mirror has great magnification! It is very portable and easy to travel with, throw it in your bag and go.",3
5,I have used this product for a long time so yes I am very satisfied with it,3
5,"and it's mild enough, so that I can tolerate it without it triggering a migraine.  Mild scent that I recommend for people who don't desire to assault the nasal passages of everyone in a 50' radius.",3
4,great for making samples,3
5,"So far so good. Since each soap lasts forever, I gave some to my mom and sister who also love it!",3
4,TASTE IS GREAT AND MY TEETH FEEL SQUEAKY CLEAN. GOT MY FREE SAMPLE IN VOX BOX AND GLAD I DID.,3
4,"Really cute and fits large or small amount of hair. It would get 5 stars if the hair was tucked under like a real bun, but it's only short hair curled under to give the effect. If the wind blows your bun will be a mess.",3
5,I have used these blades for years. They single handled stopped my razor bumps. I used to use shaving power prior to trying these blades. I started using them several years ago. Thanks to Amazon for being able to get them. They do a great job.,3
5,"Just love it! I use it daily and can't get enough of it, my skin drinks it up without being oily. I only wish it had a pleasant feminine scent, the current smell is a soft natural oil scent which is OK. I will buy it again when this is finish.",3
5,ok,3
5,Love this stuff. Makes your hair feel amazing. One of the best products on the market. It's a 10 knows what they are doing.,3
4,"I got to try this for free and when I used the razor for the first time and it was awesome. It cut through a week of growth (ie laziness) without an issue.<br /><br />I had the opportunity to try it for free and I'm not sure I could spend the money to continue using the blades when these dull. Also using the the actual trimmer as the handle is weird. It felt huge, think using a child's first crayon to write a letter compared to using a pen or pencil.",3
5,Think I got the last 4 jars of this great butter for feet.  Heard something about it being discontinued.  Hope not,3
5,Nice aroma and works great on my feet,3
5,very good,3
5,This is my favorite mascara.  I use this waterproof one for the summer months and it stays on all day with no flaking or smearing.  I love the applicator brush as well.  It brushes on evenly and separates lashes well.  I have tried several others and always go back to this one.,3
4,"Works great, heats up super quick, and never leaves a piece unstraightened! Only thing I don't like is that it's a little long and the top part gets really hot so I can't hold it from the top - has led to a hand cramp a time or two.",3
4,"I bought this and went through every single brand, and found that Feather and the Blue Bird were my favorite with Feather on top by quite a lot. The Sharks were in third with Astra, then Derby, then the Gilletes coming in last. To summarize:<br /><br />1) Feather<br />2) Blue Bird<br />3) Shark<br />4) Astra<br />5) Derby<br />6) Gillete Silver Blue<br />7) Gillete 7 O'Clock<br /><br />I was about to buy a 100 pack of Feather blades, but I stumbled on some reviewers for the Feather blades who recommended Crystal Platinums over the Feathers. I took the gamble and bought the Crystal Platinums and was glad I did. I wish that this pack included the Crystal Platinums, but this is still a good pack to start with as most likely you'll find a favorite in here. But I would recommend finding a sample pack with the Crystals in them.",3
5,Small but smells great,3
5,Years later I still have this and it works perfect! One of the best blowdryers out there! I have the super size one and then purchased this one for travel. Both are amazing!,3
5,I absolutely love this perfume!  I wear it to work and after work on the weekends.  Love it!  I will definitely buy it again.,3
5,"It's well priced, and lasts a long time, and does a good job exfoliating your skin and leaving it nice and smooth.",3
5,Makes lips feel fuller and plump.  Best color ever!  Vanilla scent could be a bit less strong but an overall great purchase!,3
5,Best lotion for  dry skin !,3
4,"I really like these little carriers.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars, was the dividers don't go all the way down to the bottom of the case.  The bottles touch each other at the bottom.<br /><br />I filled it with 15 ml bottles and the were a tight fit, but the did all fit and zipped shut.  I haven't seen anything better on the market, so,these will do fine for now.  I haven't had then more than a few months, so I will add to this review as time goes on.",3
5,I love the way I look when I'm wearing this product! I use it as an 'everyday foundation' or as a base color when I need a more formal look. I was so relieved to find it on Amazon.com after the stores stopped carrying it. Revlon - what's up with that?!? I'll use this product until the world's supply is exhausted!,3
5,I've been using this creme for years.  It really keeps my skin soft and the lemongrass fragrance is so fresh.,3
5,"First time using an electric razor, I have a thick beard and this shaver works just as good as my mach 3 razors with no pain.",3
4,Its like a new razor,3
5,This was an excellent Christmas Gift for the wife. The 5x magnification<br />was a big extra and the lighting is excellent for makeup applications.<br />This mirror is an excellent value.,3
5.0,Perfect!,3
5,Its perfect I like it,3
4,Nice color,3
5,Easy to apply.  Neat applicator,3
5,"This is a very useful product. It works nice for clean, washed hair but also can fluff up hair as a daily comb out.<br />Don't buy a cheaper copy of this because there is too much metal exposed and easy to get burned.",3
5.0,Absolutely love this lotion!!! I use it everyday and it makes my skin so soft and it smells awesome!!,3
5,I have already noticed a difference in my skin after only 2 weeks! It is smoother and my adult acne has diminished. My pores also appear to be smaller. This moisturizer is wonderful as it works on my oily/dry places both!  Being able to use the product around my eyes is also a plus. Will update you later on those results! I will reorder...,3
5,Good,3
4,Its a nice fragrance but it seems to fade fast and the bottle is huge so no worries about running out,3
5,"Love this...perfect color for me...blonde and fair.  It goes on creamy but quickly dries to powder, matte.  Good for &#34;older girls&#34;",3
5,"This is incredible stuff.  I had debris buried in my face for decades that came dislodged after just a few days of using this item.  The Palmer's site has free shipping, but it costs more per bottle.<br /><br />Order more than one:  you will wish that you did.",3
5,"This. Stuff. Is. The. Best.<br />I have dry skin. I've used so many different lotions and creams that I can't even begin to remember them all. Then I tried this, and I've never gone back.<br />I originally bought it because I had some stretch marks left on my backside from my puberty years. Well, it worked on those. Stretch marks all but invisible now. It made the skin on my backside so smooth and soft that I started using it all over my body. My dry, itchy skin practically drank it. And boom, just like that, the itchy, sometimes painful dry skin I'd battled my whole life was all better. Even in the middle of our harsh Midwestern winters, this stuff keeps my skin happy. It's even smoothed out many of those little nicks and scars that you pick up over the years. Miracle in a jar. Never stop making it.",3
5,"This is my favorite hand cream after trying many other brands.  I live in CO, known for it's dry climate, so constantly need hand cream.  This is the only one that works and it was also recommended by my dermatologist.",3
4,Holy crap -- this little thing works!,3
5,"I love this Product....you have to get used to no flavor left behind if you feel you need that you can follow with mouth wash , but My Teeth & Gums never felt cleaner and it's so easy to use, I'm converted!",3
5,This is the only mascara I have found that doesn't end the day with gray smudges under my eyes.  Highly recommend.,3
5.0,"I read about this on a relaxed hair blog and decided to try it out. I used it last week, just about 6 months after my last relaxer. I burn very easily, but I didn't think about putting anything on my scalp till about 3/4 of the way through. I only burned along my hairline, which the last couple of stylists I went to say was because my scalp is dry in those areas. So I did burn even through the restructuring mask, but, I didn't have ANY scabs, which is amazing to me. It smells great, and, I was worried seeing I still had some waves with the neutralizing conditioner, but once I started to wash the restructuring mask out, my hair was pretty much bone straight, and I'm very happy. I don't plan on using anything else ever again.",3
5,"This ia my third dryer in the last year and I love it! It straightens and smooths out my normally fine, frizzy hair quickly and works on dry or wet hair! And it stays smooth! I'm a believer!",3
4,"Pros: This trimmer is made to last. Few cheap plastic parts to break, which was the problem with my prior trimmer. It seems strong and trims really well. Comes with extras, like the mini brush to get the little hairs out of trimmer blades, oil for the blades, and a mustache comb. Long battery life, and also is rechargeable.     Cons: Too hard to switch blade guards. Not the most ergonomic shape. The base is way too small for the trimmer and all the accessories.     Bottom line: Great value. It'll last a long time, unlike some of the more expensive trimmers. Definitely gets the job done, but you still have to deal with difficult blade guards. Great purchase for the price.",3
5,Lots of compliments on the wig! Thanks for a great product and speedy delivery. :3,3
5,Recently switched to Dermalogica products after years of only using Clinique.  I use the Ultracalming line for sensitive skin.  Very good for my skin.,3
5,I love this air brush make-up. I spray it on a brush and then apply it to my face and it gives me great coverage. I would highly recommend it.,3
4,The face wash is good. my skin improved in just around 5 days. great for dry skin.,3
5,Cute accessory to ones other hair items.  Swings in ones hair.  Catches the light for some added sparkle.<br />Comes in several colors.,3
5,Love everything about this curling iron. Works great love the cord and I couldn't be happier with how it works with my hair.,3
5,This is my 3rd bottle.  I use daily and my bottom stays so soft. I had a few blemishes from time to time and none since using this product. I workout 5 days a week and this product prevents breakouts from workouts.,3
5,"My hair had become drier, but also 'coarser' in the past couple of years. It just didn't feel good! I tried many shampoos, store bought ones and some salon bought ones. I really was not happy with any, until I found this. It truly nourishes and restores your hair!",3
5,"This set is spectacular. So much to choose from, at this price point. Keeps my clients entertained and overwhelmed. If you want to see something really funny, take a close up look at plate #5...the small designs down the middle. One of my clients was looking through the plates and said, &#34;Who would want old people?&#34; I was like, what? So I looked at it, and sure enough, there's a design of two old people, hunched over, with a cane. Hilarious!!",3
5,"I only use Sigma brushes because they are wonderful and they get the job done beautifully and the price is reasonable.  Well done, Sigma.",3
5,"Stainless steel set. Case would not close, Quick adjustment made the correction. I used the clippers and worked fine. I am very pleased with this set.Its been a few months now and all is good.",3
5,Loveeeeee ittttt !,3
4,"I had read a lot of negative reviews about the trimmer's combs but i found them quite sturdy. although the way combs snap on the blade it does seem like they could break, they are strong enough to endure that if u do it with a little care. i have used all the combs that came with the trimmer and they all work fine. the blade is very good too, it trims very close to the skin but doesnt hurt, like pulling the hair instead of clipping them. if u r looking for something very cheap and affordable and at the same time expecting a good result you can buy this. the shipping was very fast too. i received it in 2 days with standard shipping. i recommend this product with 4 stars.",3
4,Really cute gift I got for a friend who loves Apple computers. It took over a month to get it but when it came I was satisfied.,3
5,"I bought this item as a gift for my sister. She bought her previous Jai'Ose in Europe many years ago and loved it. This one was exactly the same (except price, thanks to Amazon). Classic scent. Nice package makes it a good present.",3
5,"Really fun, flirty, and wispy looking lashes.  These lashes are feminine and dramatic; they add some volume and length, but nothing overboard. If you're looking for lashes that will give your eyes a more \\""open\\"" and flirty appearance, you will love these lashes.<br /><br />I love that these Demi Wispies have a clear band. This means the strip lash is much more flexible and can accommodate any eye shape with more ease. The band also makes the lashes more versatile as they can even be worn without any eyeliner. The band also makes these lashes feel very lightweight and comfortable compared to their strip-lash counterparts on the market.<br /><br />Considering the price of a single pair of these lashes, I will continue to repurchase the multipacks.",3
5,Prompt delivery of as-described item ~ Thank you!,3
5,"I use this on my face in the winter.  It's rich without being greasy.  But it's not quite enough for my dry, chapped hands (nothing seems to work better on them than Vaseline, I'm afraid).  I also love that this is product is unscented.  Highly recommend.",3
5.0,"I have wavy,frizzy hair.this product does what it says,my curls were more defined and looked and felt great.",3
5,I've tried many different serums but this one delivers more than any I've tried. It really does lift and firm skin!,3
5,The brush works much better for combing through long wet hair than a wide comb. It is gentle to the hair and I feel like I loose less hair that way. It is also great for little children when they first try to brush their own hair because the bristles are soft. Highly recommend.,3
5,"First of all I recommend buying this product on amazon instead of the website or at a salon. My salon charges $48 for this same pack. I don't know about the faulty products some of you received or think you did but my review is on the real thing. The conditioner should be very thick. Both are amazing but I usually only just need the conditioner. It's very saturated with oil and you only need A LITTLE. I apply it to my ends then middle parts of my hair strands and comb it through. Never to the root because this product can take away the volume from your hair if you use too much. I have split ends because I got ombre highlights (the ends of my hair bleached) from dark brown to very blonde so my hair was very unhealthy and the ends would frizz. The best thing about this product is that it makes your hair so soft, without having to get oil all over your hands and accidentally apply too much with hair oils. It's a very good deep conditioner and the shampoo and conditioner work best with both but my hair has gotten so healthy I only need one. When I'm in a rush some days I skip conditioner and my hair still remains soft because of this. I absolutely recommend this to anyone with frizzy, dry hair or chemically processed hair.",3
5,Cool color. Great formula. Really looks like paint splattering on nails,3
5,tried a lot of other products. Norwegian is the only one that really works. It is the only foot cream I would tell anyone to use.,3
5.0,Thiss is a great flat iron. I use it daily and have had no problems. I really like the heat resistant travel case that comes with it.,3
5,Anything neem is gr8!,3
5,Purchased my first tube of this lip balm at a retail store. My kids loved it so much I decided to bulk order for stock stuffers.,3
5,I have used this oil faithfully morning and night and have experienced much needed relief for joint pain and nerve pain in my feet...would and will purchase again and again!,3
5,Adjusted correctly these are precise and cut effortlessly.  You will not be dissappointed.  There may be better but I haven't tried them and apparently neither has my old barber.    M.P.M  The New Aira  [...],3
4,This soap lathers well and is long lasting. The only con is the scent. There is almost none and what little scent it has is not what I would consider almond. If you prefer a non-scented or VERY lightly scented soap this would be perfect.,3
4,"I don't think there is a perfect electric shaver out there, but this is very close.  This is my 3rd electric shavers I owned.  My first electric shaver was a foil shaver from Braun and which did it job fine.  After seeing all the Norelco's lift and cut commercial, I finally got the Norelco Spectra 8825 XL and finally replaced it with a Panasonic brand.  I will compare this barebones Panasonic Es 7103k with the other models I used.<br /><br />Closet shave:<br />I will have to give this to the Panasonic by a narrow margin then Braun at 2 and Norelco in 3rd.  Before I got this model, I tried my brother Panasonic and actually got a cut.  Wow, this electric shaver is the closest thing to a Bic razor.  I have not yet gotten any cut or bleeding from this newer model, but my skin feels tender and definitely need some lotion afterward.  The blade speed is 10k rpm compare to Braun at 7-8k rpm.  Higher end Panasonic shavers go up to 13k rpm.  I considered the Braun average and Norelco have trouble with thicker hair around the mustache area.  All three does evenly in the bread part of the face with a long trimmer on the first wave and switching back to the main shaver for the softer cut.  Hairs under the neck needs a first past with a long trimmer on the Braun and Norelco, but not necessary for the Panasonic, which seem to chop almost all areas evenly without the long hair trimmer.<br /><br />Smooth shave:<br />Norelco or Panasonic, then Braun.  While this model takes off my face top skin layer like no other electric razors out there, my skin does feels fresh after I give it some aftershave lotion.  Norelco design hands down is the easiest on the face.  No aftershave lotion at all.  The triple rotating blades on the Spectra, while doesn't cut as close, definitely fits my face contour better creating an even cut.  Braun (older model) definitely has a close shave but its foil/coil (not the current triple heads models) missed some hair under the neck and mustache and need more passes than both the Norelco and Panasonic.<br /><br />Power:<br />While this is not the most powerful Panasonic model out there at 10k rpm, it definitely feels more powerful then Braun or Norelco.  Granted the Norelco design is a little different.  Norelco is the quietest follow by Braun.  This model is also as noisily as my father Remington and tad under the decibel of some hair trimmer.<br /><br />Construction:<br />I like Panasonic, Norelco and Braun design and construction for varies reason, the Remington design is another story.  On the outside all three are equally solid.  Under the blade, Panasonic looks the sturdiest.  Its coils looks thicker then the Braun.  I am not sure why all the plastic parts under the Spectra blade have never been broken all these years, but they still work fine.  I got to say this flush on design and construction for all three bases on personal preferences.<br /><br />Features:<br />All three were easily to wash.  All three have swivel blade heads.  Norelco has the best contour to face.  Braun and Panasonic foil head pivot in different way.  Panasonic head pivot side to side, horizontally, that doesn't lose power from the base motor.  Braun head pivot vertically closer to the face, but comparably to a non-pivot head, it seem to lost power from the base motor in the design.  Both Braun and Panasonic coils going up and down where this Panasonic triple blades move up and down independently.  I am not sure if the 30 degree blade or its power is the reason why the Panasonic get the closet shave.  The digital screen shows how much the battery is left, but is always on.  The only drawback I see in this design is the rechargeable batteries.  Only Norelco works both as a recharge and cord plug in.  The older Braun and Panasonic work on a charge only and cannot plug and play.  The Braun batteries died and never worked again, I hope this won't happen to the Panasonic.  The newer Braun models have fixed this feature.Shave wet is a nice feature also.<br /><br />Overall this is the closet shave for a barebones unit, and that price is right.  Just wished it had the plug and play feature.unit, and that price is right.  Just wished it had the plug and play feature.",3
4,"Nail salons have switched to the cheese grater method of removing callouses from your feet. I find this disgusting because they don't use an autoclave to clean them. I bring in my own callus shaver to the salon and sometimes they are willing to use that.<br />I find these blades last a long time, but I actually use an older handle with them. This handle, because it's rounded, seems to be slippery to me. I wish salons could all use these, but the next best thing is handling your business at home.",3
5,we bought a second for her to give as a gift.  Very fun and cute and a great gift idea,3
5,"I get ingrown easily on my throat after shaving. Using this product everyday reduces them significantly. I will only get one or two ingrown with it, compared to about 10.",3
5,This is the only hair product I use now. I don't use anything else. I love it. Very good deal. They usually go for about $15-$16 at local hair salons. Also I got free 2-day shipping with a trial prime membership.,3
5,I have been using this eyeshadow for years to cover bald spots left from cancer (thankfully recovered) and menopause.  I rub it on my scalp in the bald places after washing my hair.  Works great!,3
5,This is the only nail brush that really gets underneath those nails and scrubs them clean.  I just love this brush,3
5,I used Carmex and swore by it for years...that is until I googled what was in it. Then I found this as a safe alternative.<br /><br />Would suggest you do the same if you use Carmex.<br /><br />Funny my lips are not as dry as much as they used to be.... Hmmm,3
5,Thisis a great product. It smells amazing like all Diva stuff products and it does really improve your skin making it even and toned.<br />It is also a great primer. a little goes a long way and for me since I have oily skin it is not heavy but still giving me the right moisture.<br />I highly recomend Diva Stuff . Customer service is great as well.,3
5,"My Son loves Old Spice so I buy the products by the case. He really likes the original scent which you can't find anywhere! We get the body wash, shampoo and of course the after shave. Good prices, good product! It came in good time and was packaged well. If any one know where to get shaving cream, shaving soap and talc in Old Spice Original, please let me know",3
4,"In my opinion this little gem it great! I prefer the scent, it's a great &#34;earthly, natural&#34; one, however my sister did not, so it's really based upon personal preference.<br />Unto it's performance, I do have to reapply several times a day, however I am a nursing mother so this just may be because of the little fun fact.<br />My sister will be trying the 'clay' soon, I'll update with a pros and cons then =) But for now, it's a keeper!",3
5,"Okay, I just got my F80 brush in the mail today. I couldn't wait to try it out, so I came home, took off my makeup and reapplied it using this brush. I must say I am forever sold on Sigma brushes!!! It's unbelievable how dense and soft this brush is!!! I have spent tons of money on foundation and I was always disappointed, I could never figure out why it never looked right...I watch all the YouTube videos, buy high-end makeup, but to be honest my makeup looked horrible....until now! This brush has answered my prayers. My makeup looks flawless. I even used this brush to apply my setting powder and my blush and it done wonderful. I will definitely be buying the rest of my brushes from Sigma from now on. (:",3

5,I love these brushes.  They are a great quality for the price makes you want to play with your makeup and experiment with color and technique.,3
5,Having a 4year old granddaughter I was amazed at how this brush made brushing her hair without hurting her with the tangles. It is the only brush she will allow us to use!,3
5.0,"I love this soap. I tried it on a whim after watching a documentary called Dr. Bronner's Magic Soapbox. You should check it out. Since Wmart doesn't carry Dr. Bronner's I saw they had Kirk's Castile soap. I'll try Dr. Bronner's eventually, but it is rather expensive. I was a little apprehensive at first, not knowing how well this soap works as a bath soap, but I feel more clean using it than any soap I've tried. I didn't find it irritating at all. Sorry, but Wmart carries Kirk's for $3.28 a 3 pack.    Anyway, back to the soap. It does last a fairly long time. It lathers up real well with a washcloth. My wife described the scent as pesticide, but I don't mind it at all. She's gotten used to it. I just feel cleaner longer with this soap. There's not much more to say.",3
5,I had used a similar brush at my sister's home and fell in love with it! This size is perfect for my long hair and helps me blow dry my hair quick and easy. Doesn't tangle hair at all!,3
4,It's sturdy and gets the job done !,3
5,"The older I get, the wilder my eyebrows get.  Dang it.<br /><br />I've got sensitive eyes and have to be very careful about what type of eye makeup I use lest I end up with red, itchy eyes.<br /><br />I had a makeup artist once use hairspray on an eyelash wand to style my eyebrows, but I don't use hairspray and didn't want to buy hairspray JUST for my eyebrows (sheesh).  I'd been using aloe vera gel (I use it in my hair as styling gel), but it hasn't been holding at all.<br /><br />This holds my eyebrows almost exactly like the hairspray did, without making them crunchy or strange looking.  Once dry, it doesn't interfere with my makeup.  It has no scent, is not thick and is colorless.  It takes a little while to dry, but once dry, I'm done!  My eyes are not at all irritated by it, and it doesn't flake at all.<br /><br />Overall, it's EXACTLY what I needed, and everything it advertises to be!  Less wild eyebrows for me!",3
5,I'm glad I bought this brush. I had been using a boars hair brush and had to spend alot of time building up the lather. This badger brush reduced the lather building time by at least half maybe more. I will not be going back to boars hair.,3
5,"I love Body Butter, but Coconut is my absolute favorite. I don't know if it's the coconut oil, but it seems much creamier than others that I've tried. And the aroma is delicious without you smelling like a fruit salad. I have it in the HUGE, medium and the small travel size.",3
5,This product is so easy to use and it's so compact. The screen is nice and easy to read. I love this product,3
5,"Used them to make home made bug spray. Worked great. Nice size bottle, comes with a cap too. Good purchase",3
5,"[[VIDEOID:8fab452363d852fefff8e82a444ed5ea]] I never thought I would be happy to see a nail clipping set much less reviewing one until I bought and tried this Clyppi set.  I previously owned a cheaper quality set given to me as a part of a grooming gift package years ago and although I wasn't particularly fond of the nail clippers, I held onto them and used them for a long time until recently when the thing fell apart every time I used them.  So once these arrived, off to the trash bin the old set went.<br /><br />Included in this set are a smaller fingernail clipper, a larger toenail clipper and nylon carry case.<br /><br />Every item in this set is high quality and well made, even the carrying case.  The clippers are a heavy duty stainless steel that has sharp clipping edges that cut cleanly and evenly.  The handles have raised indentations that make it easy to hang onto and use and clip with ease.  In addition both clippers have a small nail file built into each handle.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good quality clipping set that work great and look nice too.  How many clipper sets come with a lifetime guarantee?  These do, so I can't argue with my 5 star rating.<br /><br />I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.",3
4,"item was as described, I was pleased with the purchase",3
5,Was told this works well for mild bed sores/pains...  My mom is going thru chemo - perfect.  Just rub it on the area that is starting to feel sore - ...,3
5.0,Perfect scent,3
5,the best,3
5.0,Fantastic! My sister loves it!,3
5,I love my brushes. What everyone said about them being super soft and not shedding is true! I could not be happier.,3
5,I am so sick of going to the barber shop and &#34;John&#34; not being there...Now I don't care.<br />Everything I use it....I save 25 dollars...Go ahead John..take that day off.,3
5,All fragrances are personal and while shopping one day I smelled it on another lady and asked her what she was wearing and that's how I learned about it.  Very glad I followed through and ordered it.,3
5.0,The only thing that works for me.,3
5,All good,3
5,"When my husband needed a new razor we were stumped as to which one, but thanks to the great internet we were able to check reviews and ratings and that's how we decided on this brand and model.  He has had it now for about 3 weeks, and again yesterday ( and for about the 100th time ) he says, \\""This is the best shaver I have ever had, I love it!!\\"" the shave is as good as any strait blade razor!!!  He highly recommends this razor!",3
4,Was a little small but worked,3
5.0,"Love! loved every shade, they all show up beautifully.",3
5,"This hair tonic is great for eczema. I went to a few doctors. Bought all the shampoo and so on. Nothing works. Spent lots of money for expensive products that didn't work or made it worse. When they were selling Vaseline hair tonic, it worked. Then they took it off the market. I have looked all over for it. Didn't think Amazon would have it. When I found it here. It was such a relief.",3
4,love it im into big jewerly and this is awesome,3
5,Great color.  Goes well with many colors of clothing.,3
5.0,BEST STUFF EVER!!,3
4.0,"I have combination skin and have tried cleansers and scrubs from St. Ives, Clean & Clear, Neutrogena, you name it. But a lot of them leave my cheeks dry and even flaky. This one from Olay doesn't dry out my sensitive areas but still cleans the oily parts of my face. Keep in mind that this is only a cleanser, so your zits and dark spots won't magically disappear. But it will leave your face refreshingly clean.",3
5,The Farouk Flat Iron is AMAZING! Straightens hair in seconds without any heat damage. Definately a GREAT flat iron!,3
5,I love all the different colors of eye shadow's. I can make any look I want now instead of just the browns I had before. I like that the lip gloss isn't thick like some kits I've gotten before. I would order again though I don't think I will need too any time soon. -Christina,3
5,"This product is the best. It smells wonderful and my feet feel like heaven. The toenail fungus I have harbored for two years has gone away and I have used the soak for just a few months, 4 nights a week or so. I will continue using it because it is so enjoyable. My feet are now softer, too.",3
5,"I have been using this for the last 5 years. Compared to other B-5 products, this product does the job at nearly 1/3rd the price.",3
4.0,Perfect!! Shipping takes a long time...,3
5,"I have used this for a week now. I'm 34 with mild acne breakouts. T-zone oily and dry cheek skin, starting to see wrinkles because of the dryness. I wanted this for my breakouts and to help with the dryness. Everything seems to break me out but this hasnt So far. My skin is brighter, smoother, softer. I have never seen my face so bright looking. The active acne I had is clearing up but I am also putting a little tea tree oil on my face. But this stuff so far has been a blessing to my skin<br /><br />Update** it's been a few weeks and I'm still loving this. Use it morning and night. Keeps my skin soft plump and bright. Still has not caused breakouts. I will continue to buy when I run out",3
5,Love this product!  Easy to use.  No messy wax strips.  Hair is removed with ease.  No need for expensive salon visits ever again.,3
5,"Then this works great. I have fine 2c/3a curls , I use it on soaking wet conditioned  hair and top it with a gel. Great curl enhancement and lots of shine.",3
5,Awesome,3
5,The product is greate but the shipping is so poor,3
5,I used this as a shaving brush. A cheap alternative for beginners looking to get a brush for shaving needs.,3
5,Really good product at a reduced price - this holds curls and smells good,3
4,"Though it does not come with vacuum cleaning system, I like its water resistant heavy duty steel and lifetime guarantee.<br />I use it for trimming both nose and ear hair. It is very easy to use and quiet while using.  It will be nicer if a carring case is included.",3
5.0,"Oral B PRO 3000 with soft, gentle bristles allows a thorough teeth cleanse over sensitive gums. I use aurom&egrave;re's aryuvedic herbal toothpaste, followed by aurom&egrave;re's neem & peelu herbal mouthwash. This combination couldn't be smoother, nor more efficient. This beats a toothbrush any day 😃 It's easy, clean, efficient - just a breeze!",3
5,Why did i choose this rating?<br /><br />Because it works just fine for me! :)<br /><br />I first bought a hemp conditioner for some weeks but it didnt worked so well so i tried this one and im full statisfied now :),3
4,"Great nose trimmer. The light is kind of useless, but as far as the nose trimmer, it seems more sturdy and seems to have better blades than the little 9.99 ones I used to buy from Norelco and Panasonic. It cuts right through and there is no pulling. For some reason nose hair trimmers always seem to break on me, but I have had this one for about 6 months and am very happy with it.",3
5,"Great product that I have been using for a long time. I prefer liquid hand soap that is NOT antibacterial--it's not necessary, not good for the environment, and may lead to resistant strains of bacteria. These refills are a great buy--exactly what I have been using and much more economical than buying those little pump bottles all the time.",3
5,AWESOME!But some leaked by other then that :P,3
5,EXCELLENT,3
5.0,FAVE,3
5,One of the best I've ever tried. I think I like the dark green cones the most. But all four scents are elegant and unobtrusive.   The size is perfect for an average room and this set includes a very cute mini tile for holding a cone too.,3
5,"This is a great product. I've used many of these and Tweezerman is the best. The construction is sturdy (I've had others snap in half) and the two-sided file does the job. One side of the file is rough, the other is for smoothing. A word of caution: the rough side is VERY rough. I got a little over-zealous once and scratched up my heel without realizing it. Highly recommend this product.",3
4,"Not a magic, works like a light scrub",3
5,I dont have this dryer yet but my fiance's mother is a hair stylist and uses one. Its quite and it makes my hair so soft and shinny! One drawback is that it takes a little longer to dry then my other dryer. Its worth to wait because my other dryer dries my hair out. Cant wait till mine gets here!,3
5,I couldn't find this product anywhere in stores and found it online here for cheaper!,3
5,"I am so impressed with this product! This razor was provided for me from a program by Gillete Venus and I'm glad I got the chance to try it out. I've used plenty of other Venus razors, but none were like this! At first I thought this would just be like a plain old razor, nothing special, but I was wrong! I got the closest shave that I've ever had from a razor! The only downfall I see is that the moisture bars on my razor ran out at different times. The bottom one ran out before the top so it didn't glide as easily over my legs after a few uses. But i solved that problem with shaving cream.<br />Overall, I'm very happy with this product and I will have to repurchase it!",3
5,"I have a serious problem with cuticles, I hate them and I cut them almost daily. I typically use slant edge clippers but they are very hard to come by and when you do find them they are not very sharp.  These are so sharp! They do in fact cut your cuticles perfectly. I highly suggest raising the cuticles with another tool and using these only to snip as I have bled many times. Just got the hang of it, it is very easy to cut too much. But like I said just figure them out and you will be happy you purchased them.",3
5,Sent on time. Great item,3
5,Work perfect,3
5,"I bought this for my dad because he absolutely loves this cologne but couldn't find it in the department stores!! He is very pleased with it, spell great and lasts long!",3
5,"I know this product isn't designed to fight acne, but if your skin is very, very sensitive it does. Okay, I have tried everything - absolutely everything to cure acne. First, I tried everything I could find over the counter, randomly picking one thing after another. I also tried Proactive only to discover that like everything else designed to fight zits, Benzoyl Peroxide is so strong it only irritates my sensitive skin and makes it break out worse. So I decided to try a more gentle approach and followed a book's regimen for vitamin and herbal remedies. This also, was to no avail. Then I went to the dermatologist. The solution he had me put on my face had the potency of airplane paint stripper...and the same effects. After a year of going to the dermatologist, my face was breaking out worse than it ever has before or since.    Let me tell you, by this time, my face was worse than just breaking out. It was so sensitive to so many product I had tried that it was constantly itching and bright red all over! After realizing the products I had been using were the problem I went through quite a long stage when I wouldn't let anything but water touch it. The after-effects of these products still would not reverse.     I bought the book, [[ASIN:0553383302 The Skin Type Solution]] and took the quiz, which referred me to my chapter. (This book is absolutely the Bible of skincare.) I was surprised when my chapter said that my face might not tolerate Benzoyl Peroxide - something I already knew very, very well. The book recommended \\""Aveeno Ultra Calming Moisturizing Cream\\"" instead - a product so gentle that it doesn't even claim to cure acne. But for my sensitive skin, it did!!! It didn't take near as long as I had expected before the pimples vanished. Then the redness went away. It took a little longer for my face to feel normal again, but gradually, even the constant itching vanished completely. I have been using this product for the last three years and it really works!  I'm beginning to get really worried because it's so hard to find the night cream version of this product. I hope Aveeno never stops making this.",3
5,ahh my feet feel great,3
5,"Despite the fact that these aren't HQ55+, they work just fine in my electric razor.  Don't know if there's a significant difference.  This is my second time buying them from Amazon.com - have never been dissatisfied.",3
5,"Salts smell lovely, salt mixture all natural, looks nice and lavenderie, don't mind the seeds they to are wonderful, great product, family enjoyed much, l will buy again buk.",3
5,"At first I was disappointed that is was such a small amount, but you don't need much. It is great, not too obvious.",3
5,"I received a sample of this product through Bzz Agent and I'm so glad I did. I have serious dry scalp issues that often cause me extreme discomfort, scabs and sores. This soother instantly soothed, moisturized and relieved my discomfort. The Head & Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother has been a saving gracing from years of discomfort. This product will stay in my hair care regimen.",3
5,This is one of the best trimmers in the market for the price. Of course the gillette shaving kit has no parallel either,3
5,"I really like this product, and I feel that it is softening the lines<br />around my eyes. I use it on the upper part of my eyelids and<br />have noticed a big difference. I would recommend this product.",3
5,"These are discontinued, so I heard cuz I can't find them in store but since my father likes them I stocked him up on them.",3
5,Ok so I needed a good deep conditioner and I saw this product And Tried It. I have really thick hair and now it feels healthier than ever!,3
5,This has a very nice scent (for a man). After I used up my first can I decided I liked it enough that I ordered 6 more so I'm set for the next few years.,3
5,The plate is very large that you can keep it for a long time,3
4,"I bought this item after reviewing several online reviews of portable hair dryers.  I usually use at least some rollers, so based on others' experiences, I went with this one.  Overall I like the dryer a lot - easy to use, bonnet with sufficient room for rollers.  My only complaint is that it only has 2 settings: hot and cool, and the hot can get VERY hot -untolerable for me. The cool isn't warm enough to  dry my hair very quickly.  So I end up alternating between the 2.  I would like a medium setting or a temperature dial feature (but I guess that might make it a more expensive, professional quality dryer then).",3
5,Everything as described,3
5,"I tried the whole proactive package for several months with no success.  The refining mask, however, reminded me of a product that had helped me years ago, but had since been discontinued.  I decided to order this product by itself and it's working well for me.<br />Also, the item shipped quickly.  No complaints.  Great Service.",3
5,This is the perfect color for me tried it at the mall and did not want to pay the full price they ask so this is a good price on here will buy again when it finishes usually buy 1 or 2 a year,3
4,"goes on easily, smells wonderful, feels great!  For anyone looking for 'something' when nothing doesn't do during the day, or under the day cream, or night cream..",3
5,"This item does help the eyelashes to come off easy but it burns your eyes very bad? But if you are trying to get them off, it does work",3
5.0,"I've tried lots of anti-aging products and this stuff is the best,yet!",3
5.0,"Skin reacts in rashes to most OTC sunscreens. This is good stuff. No problems, good value.",3
5,This is a good quality replacement that fits perfectly.  I would recommend this as a replacement set.  Sometimes hard to find the right set.,3
5,Trusting it is helping with my candida condition.,3
4,"I have 4 Sara Monica Flower Hair Clips that I ordered at the same time based on all the excellent reviews.  I agree with other reviewers that they are lovely flowers and well made.  I love wearing flowers in my hair, but I have found these to be a bit over-powering and large for my personal taste.  One particular problem I have is that my hair gets tangled in the pin part. To deal with this I actually broke the pin off so I could clip it in my hair.  Overall, great quality and perfect for those who like a more big and bold look.",3
5,Exactly the way I remember it. Brings back wonderful memories. I will  buy more when needed. I love this product,3
5,my hair is curly and I'm of african americal decent.  this product helps me define each and every curly for a really afro centric curly look. i get so many complements on my hair style (from everyone).,3
4.0,It worked pretty good in my blonde dry hair . I do prefer a different product over this but this is good as my back up or if I need something cheaper,3
5.0,"This is absolutely the best foundation I've ever used.  It has GREAT coverage, very resistant, and durable, doesn't cake, smooth, and blends wonderfully with the neck area.  I literally cannot stress enough how perfect it is!  I'm really happy I found the product and was brave enough to try it out.  DO recommend it and will keep getting back to it for a while :)  you don't need much to get desirable results, just a little dap!",3
5,I have used other products that claim the same results and they came no where near meeting my expectations.  The product lasts a long time time because it takes very little for great results.,3
5,I've used this Solar Oil for several months now and love it! I removed my acrylics that I'd had for years and used this at least 3 times a day for about a month and now once daily for upkeep.  My natural nails have never looked so good!  This price is great because my local nail salon sells it for $17 per bottle.,3
5.0,Great nail dryer.  I love it!  My polish seems to stay on much longer when I dry it with this lamp.,3
5,Easy to use great product my kids and wife really love these I would buy these again great buy for the price,3
5,"great smell lasts all day long! I think it's &#34;female&#34; perfume, but I wear it..........it smells nice on both sexes.",3
5,Great !!!,3
5,"Made my grizzly bear man feet less nauseating to look at. This is a large cheese grater for your feet. I love this thing. It takes care of business, ultimate foot care.",3
5,"I get little fluid filled bumps on my eyelid sometimes and bought this at the recommendation of my eye doctor. This cleanser really seems to help clean and prevent the bumps from appearing. It's also great at removing eye makeup, even the waterproof mascara. I always was my eyes with this and then run my whole face, works great as a bedtime face wash.",3
5,Saw this item on a Shark Tank rerun and I had to order the product. I couldn't believe how smooth and healthy my skin looked afterwards. Also I have acne pro skin in certain (at the age of 32) this product didn't lead to any pimples. I think this product is spa grade and should be in a high end spa. I'd definitely pay for it in a spa. Thank you so much for making it! The Sharks missed out!!,3
4,this product is pretty cool for beginner like myself I didn't know how much of a difference it made shading in your eyebrows but it does,3
5.0,"it is light, but i ordered a lighter shade.<br />im ordering a darker next week to see if it covers my dark circles.",3
5,I have been using essential oils for 3 year. This product is a pure oil quality oil for a good price.,3
5,Works great to wash your face with! My face already looks more clear and feels great when you put the cleanser on; it tingles on your skin!,3
5,"wonderful ...  the bar itself is large...  we are about half way through it...  the sent is mild Eucalyptus so its sorta like minty and vicks vap-o-rub (we find it very pleasant.<br /><br />It a long lasting soap..  the bar does not dissolve away so you get a good value,  it rinses away clean leaving your skin with a soft smooth feel.<br /><br />As a soap snobs (we always have 4 different bars in the shower to choose from) - this will be a regular product in our rotation.<br /><br />life is short ..  spoil yourself in simple ways... and enjoy",3
5,I love this product as well and you can typically buy this in large grocery store chains - I thought I would check online.  What an outrageous rip off on the price.  It is triple what it costs in the stores.,3
4,"I have used it for 2 weeks for a single blade, still fine.  It may not extend the life of a blade that long as promoted, but it definitely makes each shve smoother and more comfortable.",3
4,I took a chance to order this for my husband because I know he mostly enjoys the old scent colognes that he grew up wearing. He actually said he liked it and I was very happy about that because I wanted him to have something different and nice to wear. We'll see if he still wants to stick with this scent for the future.  :-),3
5,I have thick hair that is fairly coily. This helps detangle my hair. I use a detangler conditioner as well.,3
5,"I use this oil and Passion oil (the same brand) and like them both. I prefer to use this one at night after bath, for massage and relaxation. It smells very gently, makes the skin soft, warm and smooth. Will order more!",3
5,"Took a while to get here, but I am grateful to have it!!  Thanks!",3
5,I have decent skin but every now and then get break outs that nothing will cure. I had a friend that had tried this skin-care kit from her doctor. I checked on Amazon and sure enough it was there. When I received the kit I followed the instructions and noticed a huge difference after two uses. By the end of the week everything had cleared up. My next break out I am going to document with pictures and post them here. I have re ordered the kit to have a spare after I finish using the first one. Thanks  Rebecca,3
5.0,Love this!,3
5,Smooth and nice smelling. I mix with different essential oils and it smells even better.,3
4,I am happy with the conditioner as it is a able to soften my chemically damaged hair. The combing has gotten easier.,3
4,Very good productt. You  can actually feel the lifting affect when you first apply product. Would buy again even though it is a bit expensive.,3
5,Stays on my nails without chipping for at least 4 days.  Great neutral color!,3
5,"This is great foundation. It covers well, but still looks natural. I have never found a better color match for my fair skin and freckles. I have used bare minerals for many years and both  loved/had issues and I just really like this liquid mineral makeup. No breakouts either!",3
5,"I first used this product when I was in London.  When I saw I could buy it here, I jump on it.  I think it is one of the best dry shampoos out there",3
5,Fast reaction and fast delivery. Thank you very much for such products. I am very happy with this purchase :) Thanks a lot. I am very glad.,3
4.0,"Have only used a couple of times, but so far so good.",3
5,Best thing on the market for cuts...works wonderful...just wish we could buy it locally,3
5,I LOVE THE DOVE BODY WASH WITH GRAPEFRUIT AND LEMONGRASS.  I'VE BEEN USING IT FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. IT HAS AN EXFOLIATE IN IT WHICH IS GREAT. IT SMELLS AND FEELS SO REFRESHING AFTER EVERY SHOWER.,3
5,Great conditioner and no animals were harmed.,3
5,I love Olay period but I really like this cream & serum combo. It has a nice smell for one but the cream is very velvety and goes on so smoothly. I love the feel of it.,3
5,I am happy with this purchase.,3
5,No metals? Thank you very much. Done. Full stop.,3
5,"I always use this on my hair, defiantly an awesome treatment and repair for girls who bleach there hair, that ends up fried or dry",3
5,"Have used this product for a while, it is the only one that keeps me from burning, if you have not tried it, I suggest it.  I really love it.",3
4,Very happen with product,3
5,Love this balm for after sun or for everyday use. It smells nice and rubs on easily.,3
5.0,Love this nail polish! I used it once at a nail salon and couldn't ever find it again. Super excited to own it!,3
5,was very nice and came faster than expected.,3
4,These come vac sealed which is great for storage. thy are coarse and rough but not overly.,3
4.0,"Love the product works great on my daughters and my hair too, it came fast. The only thing is the oil turns into a clumpy cream but once u put it in ur hair it turns bck to oil...???? will be buying more soon",3
5,I bought this wig a little skeptical because well no reviews but I am SO PLEASED with the results. The wig came in earlier than expected and it is so true to the photo. The color is vibrant and the bangs are to die for. I love it. I've gotten so many compliments ☺️,3
5,"I usually order Grabel's bay rum but I was impressed by all the positive reviews so I tried this brand. A little pricy but worth it, it puts me in mind of royall spice bay rum back when it was no so over priced. Really refreshing and soothing after your shave.Recommended",3
5,"It makes lashes look amazing and it lasts the whole day. When applied, it looks very natural. Totally satisfied! Will buy more.",3
5,love it,3
4,I like the mirror but I find the picture of it to be a bit deceiving.  It made me think I was actually getting 3 mirrors.  I am happy with the product but I think u need to change the picture to show what the mirror actually looks like.,3
5,Absolutely LOVE them!!,3
5,This mascara is my ultimate favorite! I understand why it's a high end price because it's an amazing product. I received a small sample of this mascara in one of my monthly beauty subscription box and I am so glad I did. It's not labeled as waterproof but I have cried so many time while wearing this and it does not budge. I work long hours and it my lashes look great from beginning to end. I highly recommend this. You will not be disappointed 💁🏽,3
5,"Just...yes...<br /><br />This is one of my favorite &#34;guy scents&#34;. It's not overpowering, just the right amount of muskiness. I love it!",3
5,I love this stuff.  It makes my scan smooth and I do notice a difference in my skin when I use this product.  I have used many other wrinkle creams from cheap to expensive and keep coming back to Neutrogena.  I use their day and night repair creams.,3
4,"I just bought this and tried it for the first time. I cannot believe how soft it makes my hands! I don't have a skin condition or anything some have said in the above reviews. I find it made my hands softer than anything I've tried before. Although the scent isn't my favorite, I don't find it unbearable. I love how natural the product is too.",3
5,"the brush is good, but the tongue cleaner is amazing. seriously, its the best. so many of the others on the market don't really work. this one does. Not sure why they haven't patented this and locked it down. Instead they seem to be moving on from it. It's getting harder and harder to find.",3
5,Good product.,3
5,Love it!,3
4.0,"I bought this for my very young daughter, I like it but some scents aren't for me, it smells good on my daughter.",3
5,I received all clear tubes and used them for homemade toothpaste. They worked great.,3
5,"This colgone is one of the best i've ever had.  Constantly getting compliments on it.  Goes from day to night quite well, and is perfect for a summer scent.  Clean, crisp, and lingering.  Would recommend getting the big bottle, its going to go fast.",3
5,"Rec'd this complementary from Influenster and was glad I did. This stuff really works. I use it daily, but really notice it works when I am out doing yard work. I am working up a storm and don't leave my shirts totally drenched.",3
5.0,"I got this sunscreen because a dermatologist on Dr. Oz recommended it.  It is wonderful.  Covers easily, doesn't stain, and provides broad-band protection.",3
4,"I have fine, straight, short hair. I like this line. Works well with my type of hair. The only down side is that it is a bit pricy.",3
5,"I love using this sunscreen. I found this using the Consumer Working Group's Sunscreen Guide. It is highly rated as both effective and as a safe product with little to no chemicals known to cause health problems. It goes on like a lotion and doesn't look white. It feels soft and moisturizing, and it protects my skin. It is good to use every morning, but I always try to reapply later in the day. I have found it is my favorite winter sunscreen, and I only apply it to my face (because it is expensive.) Great product.",3
5,"My wife has been using this product for many years and it is the only thing she uses on her cuticles. She is a professional esthetician and recommends the product to everyone she knows. Give it a shot, especially at the price online, don't buy it from a salon...unless it's my wife's. ;)",3
5,This is great - I would never have expected this sponge to leave my skin so soft and clean!!,3
5,"The nail file is amazing, I don't have to file my nails constantly.  I file them once a week and I am done, no snags, no missed spots.  My nails look good and don't drive me crazy by needing to be filed all the time.  I am going to purchase several of these as gifts.  Try it you won't be disappointed.",3
5,"Great product, This is a high-end primer with a price that can't be beat! I've used many primers that claim to be &#34;high-end&#34; but really just have a high price.  Works great for diminishing the appearance of pores, very soft and smooth and does a great job keeping your makeup looking flawless all day! I tend to have oily skin and this is the perfect cure! I've seen some people complain about the amount of actual product in the bottle, but I think they may just be using too much of it.  I apply very little, let it dry completely, and it will lasts until I wash everything off before bed. Overall, a Great product.",3
5,Very pleased with this product. I dont have to worry about any toxic ingredients in it. WOuld recommend to everyone.,3
5.0,Excellence!!!,3
5,No white flakes and long lasting scent and anti-perspiration make this my go to!,3
5,"really makes my lashes look longer, Easy to apply no clumping.",3
5,Great product.,3
4,"Getting it out of the way, I received this product as part of a promotion, and paid barely anything for it. However this review will be unbiased despite not having paid full price for it.<br /><br />Definitely the best part of this product is the ingredients. It smells natural for one, and everything about it is just pleasant. I have a shoe cabinet where shoes just get tossed inside, rarely does anything get aired out and suffice to say it doesn't smell nice. Using this there was an immediate and lasting effect, it smells fresher and definitely does it's intended job. Honestly would continue to use this product as it just works.<br /><br />This would've been 5 star had I receive my product in perfect condition. The product came in barely protected, the shipper box was a bit banged probably due to delivery handling, however the bottle itself was also dented and probably had minor leakage as the box smelled like the product's spray as soon as I opened it. I wouldn't have deducted a full star, but there's no 4.5 rating, if there was it would be 4.5.",3
5,"This leave in conditioner makes my hair feel soft and moisturized. It instantly brought life back to my second and third day curls. Its great to use as \\""underwear for your hair\\"" under a curling gel/cream and works great for twists and braids.<br /><br />(Note: this conditioner should not be used on straightened hair because it will cause it to revert to the hair's natural pattern, causing frizz.)",3
5,Used only once but i already see and feel a difference!,3
5.0,Noticed a dramatic change in my dry frizzy hair. Can't live without this now. Believe me the price becomes nothing when you use this.give it a try and youll love it!,3
5,"After dealing with major hair loss for the last 7 years due to change of life, two major surgeries and high level of stress I went to a dermatologist last year and had every blood test known to man and a scalp biopsy all inconclusive. At my wits end I read about Visical and sent for it, used it for three months then stopped feeling the hair loss stopped and my crown and sides were thin, the hair was growing but never thick in those areas again, but not thinner. Now six months later I thought I will try it again and in the last three weeks my hair is growing and so is the hair on my chin fast and furious. I can always go for electrolysis or laser so that will never bother me loss of hair on my head will so I will continue with Visical and other hair thickners like living proof and wen and ojon shampoos.I agree that it is also helping my very weak nails. Good luck to everyone going through this depressing situation and best wishes if you decide to try Visical it is worth it.",3
5,Got for daughter as gift.I am a sparkling and brilliant white diamonds lady have been for years. After daughter used it she asked me to try it. I did for her.<br />I now purched another roll. on for myself. The roll on is good for purses and I admit I like it for different times seller was right. Beware of Other copy cats. This one is good.,3
5,"These blades are awesome. I got them for free from a Gillette program and they are super sharp and smooth. I tend to dry shave a bunch with just water and no shaving cream if I'm in a hurry, and these blades don't hurt or leave a rash. Obviously they are new, so I'll have to see how they hold up over time.",3
5,I bought this instead of the Clarisonic and I seriously love it. I've never had any skin issues but after months of using this daily I've noticed such a difference in the brightness of my skin. I would repurchase again in a heartbeat,3
4,"Previously had an OSTER, but the last two I have had didn't last very long.<br />Trying the Conair, still getting used to the way it hangs. (Sideways)",3
5,This is a great product.  Easy to use and sufficient coverage to a specific area. I highly recommend this product.,3
5,I don't have a clue why Sally Hansen stopped making this product. I have used it for 30 years at least...I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  Super Fast Shipping also.,3
5.0,Great product!  It was recommended to me as a remedy for cysts and it works!,3
4,these really do give your face a nice glow! easy travel packets too!,3
5,"I have reordered this product after using the expensive, well known brand and it is just as good.  I use the Phyto+ at night after thoroughly cleansing my face and before moisturizing.  In the morning I use the C E Ferulic on bare face, neck and chest area before applying moisturizer and face make up.  If I get a blemish I immediately apply a dot of the C E Ferulic on the area.  I think it helps.  I have had a number of small pre-cancer lesions on my face and chest area burned off and have used these products on the red areas afterwards (when the scabs start to fall off) to help in the healing.  My skin has never looked smoother or better.",3
5,"Very good, I like! Thank you amazon",3
4,It just as picture but it smells like kerosene and it is stiff. but it will look great on me,3
5,"Okay - this a little silly but can't find the Clear Stick reliably locally (CVS, Target, RiteAid, ShopRite).",3
4,Very good have  to get used to the oder.,3
5,Best nail hardener ever!,3
5,Great colors love them,3
5,"This is a really nice mid size hair dryer.  It is great for compact places, as I hate having to wrap a cord up.  I like the multiple heat settings and the high and low and cool shot button.  I have purchased two of these...one for myself and one for my guest bathroom (and in case I need a back-up).  I would definitely recommend this hair dryer.",3
4,I am satisfied with this set 😊,3
4,"I used this product once in the past when I had relaxed hair, an it left me pretty satisfied. Now that I am natural I wanted to give the product yet another try. Moderation is key with this product, but it does what its suppose to be so thats a plus in my book. All in all i'm still a satisfied customer.",3
4,Has a smell that you either love or hate. After the company sent me this product I have seen a  change in the way women act around me. Much more..inviting.,3
5,"these are great blades, new to this type of shaving and was looking for a really good $ razor sharp blade.",3
4,My wife uses this to cut my hair.  It is a nice setup.  I liked the extra trimmers that were included.  She still has a little trouble with the combs. A video would be nice.,3
5,"I bought this razor over a year ago, and I wouldn't trade it in for any other razor out there. It really does leave your skin super smooth. I love the triple blades on it so I know I can get a close, comfortable shave, even in hard to reach places. Thanks to the pivoting head, it moves with the curves of your legs without the worries of getting cut. It's also excellent for shaving the underarm area. I find that one stroke is all it takes, and you have a smooth appearance you have to feel and see to believe. This is truly a remarkable product for the women out there who are tired of shaving every other day, or more than three times a week. With this razor, it shaves so close to the hair follicle, you will be shaving in less time, less often. I will never part with my Venus razor. The best part is - it's a bargain for what you get!!",3
5,"It's only toothpaste, but this is as good as toothpaste gets.  Used to be hard to find when Caswell and Massey stopped carrying it.",3
5,"This is the best conditioner I've ever used. I use another, cheaper conditioner to comb through and rinse out, and use small amount of this as a \\""leave-in \\"" conditioner. People always remark at the healthiness of my hair.",3
5,"my girlfriend loves it, me too. Its definitely my favorite. I will buy this one again. highly recommended. good quality",3
5,"The most amazing hair products I've used in a long time, maybe ever! I have straight hair and using these products helps to make it very straight. It helps to remove those waves some of us get after washing our hair.    The shampoo and conditioner make your hair silky smooth. They smell good too!    The iron guard is probably my least favorite of all. It's okay but I thought it made my hair feel heavy. I only used it once so far, I will try it again, I may have applied it too heavily.    The silk infusion is amazing! I've been using it for a couple of years now. It helps to control frizz. It makes my hair a bit heavy also, but in a good way by controlling the frizzy, fly-away hairs.    This would make a very nice gift set for someone who is into having their hair look perfect and who isn't?!    Might I add, I also use chi shine infusion spray (not part of this set) which I also highly recommend =)    All of the Chi products I've used smell good and they all smell the same.",3
5.0,I LOVE Jane lredale Makeup! I have used her makeup skin care for over ten years. I had a plastic surgeon refer her skin care as he used it for all his face lift patients. It was a life saver for me. I has a really bad after 50's skin break out on my face. My Gym and Dermatologist was NO help. After 2 of yeras of pure he.. I was able to find healing. I have found all of Jane Iredale products to be the best available.There Customer Service is wonderful!,3
5.0,"Rich, Dark, Smokey, and Unique. This has become my signature scent!",3
5,"This is one of those things I just can't live without.  I used to buy a nail oil from QVC which came in a tiny bottle and was much more expensive until I found out about CND's Solar Oil.  You can also purchase this at CVS but you will pay more for it.  I bought the large bottle and refill my smaller polish sized bottle that I carry with me during the day.  When I don't use this, my cuticles look dry and rough and after applying this product, my nails look 100% better, even if I have no polish on them.  You will not be disappointed with this product and the affordable price Amazon sells it for.",3
5,"This is the best toothpaste ever!  It's a shame more people are not familiar with it!  I have used it since I was a teenager and have had only one new cavity in 40 years.  I like the hint of clove, so to me it also tastes the best of any toothpaste I have tried.",3
5,"I bought this in order to meet the $25 free shipping. Without any expectations, this toothbrush is pretty good. The bristles are soft and sturdy. You can brush as throughly as you want with some force and the bristles will not unravel as cheap toothbrushes would often do. If you need an item to meet the $25 free shipping, this item is indispensable.",3
5,"I received a free full size sample of this product to review, all opinions are honest and my own. I have grown up on Crest toothpaste and have always loved their products. I received the  Crest-Pro health toothpaste to review and can tell you that after using it for about 2 weeks my teeth feel much cleaner. I can even notice a difference from my generic Crest toothpaste I was using to the Pro-Health. I love how strong the minty flavor is - strong a long lasting that is! It leaves my mouth feeling clean and minty fresh for hours after use. The gritty parcels take a little getting used too...but as soon as you realize how awesome they effectively clean your mouth you will learn to love them!",3
4,It's good because it doesnt pull out your hair but at the same time it stretches out so easily!,3
5,"I picked this product up on a whim and was very surprised with the results. The first thing I noticed was the smell, there is a very faint tan odor but it is not a bad smell at all. I was expecting the pungent smell of a gross tan product but after 2 hours there was absolutely no smell of any kind.    The color is very nice, it is not orange or fake at all. I am naturally very pale, so one application made me 3 to 4 shades darker in color. I also tried it with their exfoliating towel and the results seemed to last a little longer. For anyone using this for the first time I recommend applying it only once; the directions say you can apply more after fours hours when it has completely developed, but I found it became very streaky after trying to layer it. This might not be the case for naturally darker skinned people (I'm not sure). I use it with a gradual tan moisturizer which seemed to help blend the color on my hands, elbows, knees, etc. (But be sure to wash the palms of your hands!)I also layer it with a liquid bronzer or a temporary spray bronzer and I find it enhances the color. The directions also said this was safe to use on the face, but I have not tried this and I don't think I would; I think it would be difficult to blend and would not absorb well.     I bought the Tan Towels that come in a silver package because I thought they would similar to this product. Those towels say, \\""Dark\\"" on them but they were actually not as dark (on me) as these ones. (Although they also did not smell or streak). I'm not sure if those are a different company but there is definitely some differences in the two types of towels.     I would definitely recommend these Tan Towels to my friends because: There is little to no odor, the color is a beautiful bronze and not orange at all, streaking is minimal- and with practice not an issue, you can reuse the tan towel if you put it back in the package and seal it in a zip lock bag.",3
4,"When I first tried this, my first thought was very floral, warm and powdery. Because it smells so powdery (not the baby powder kind) I feel like this would be better suited to an older lady (actual lady, not just the granny down the street, but more like Meryl Streep). It is very elegant and classy, there is no hint whatsoever of that alcohol/chemical smell so common in lower priced perfumes even when initially applied. It's soft and warm, not sharp and dry. I would definitely recommend it if you like elegant, warm, powdery perfume or as a gift to an elegant lady with a taste for quality and powdery scent.",3
5,Was exactly what I was expecting.  Very good because I can't find this product in stores.  It arrived promptly so I didn't have to worry about it getting here by Christmas.,3
5,When I wear Vera Wang Princess I always get asked what I am wearing. This is my favorite spray. I always have some on hand. Nice price too!,3
5,One of my fav scents....smells good. I have the body wash and also the body spray. If you looking for a good scent here you go !,3
5,Awesome product!,3
5.0,"Item arrived ready to use and in perfect condition! It has ample space for one hand or one foot. I used it to cure IBD builder gel and it worked great! Only thing I wish is that there was a one minute option on timing or that if you pressed the timer start button again it would turn off lights rather than having to turn off entire power, this is not an inconvenience just don't know if it will be hard on machine in the long run. I have only used machine once thus far, so can't speak to longevity of bulbs etc. but this machine was packaged well, doesn't feel cheap, and gets the job done for a lot less money than others.",3
5,"I absolutely adore these insoles.  Let me say though, I may not use them exactly like some of you do.  I glue these into my shoes so they never wrinkle.  One reviewer said that they will bunch up or wrinkle badly and once they wrinkle, you can never get the wrinkles out.  I’m sure that’s true if you slide them into your shoes and proceed to wear them as is.  I like to wear the original Sperry boat shoe and they have a half innersole.  Underneath the toe area and ball of the foot, there isn’t a smooth leather insole, it’s just unfinished leather (kind of like buck skin).  I don’t like this!  I buy Tacco insoles and glue them into my Sperry’s.  They work wonderfully!  They provide a little cushion and also a great tactile feeling of having smooth leather the full length of the shoe.  I love them but also have in perspective that this is a thin layer of leather with just a little bit of charcoal padding underneath.  It fits my purposes perfectly!",3
5,Great oil at a great price! Don't think this is lesser quality oil just because it's less expensive than other brands.<br />The only difference is Now oils aren't over inflated on price like some other oils are.,3
5,This is a super body wash.  Not too powerfully strong or artificial smelling.  It leaves a very clean feel after rinsing off and doesn't contain any of the annoying exfoliating scrub stuff (to me it's annoying anyway).  The scent is very clean smelling but not too strong and it doesn't overwhelm with any artificial smells.  First used this at a Courtyard Marriott in Manhattan after a grueling day scurrying about town.  It was truly refreshing and renewing!,3
5,"I had used this gel for a year before Garnier discontinued it.  It is the only gel I've found that is not too heavy for my very fine hair.  Sorry I will not be able to buy more in the future, but for a while at least my hair will look nice and be easy to style.",3
5,This was recommend by a friend and it really works. I was only using it as needed but with the humidity lately I have been taking it regularly and within a week I could feel a difference. I would recommend this product,3
4,"I really wanted this product to work.  I am 47yrs old and have been a marathon runner since I was 25.  Despite the miles logged from running, my stomach would pouch out the moment I ate something.  I used this gel with a tight wrap (girdle with velcro) and hoped for the best, all the while feeling very skeptical.<br />However, I did notice that my abs felt tighter.  I am not sure if this is from wearing the girdle daily at night for a couple of hours or because of the gel.<br />It is cheaper to buy this gel and wrap yourself than to purchase the pre-made gel wraps so for that purpose, I would recommend it.",3
5,I do recommend it! Strips are soft and don't rupture. Also small strips are very helpful in bikini wax .,3
4,Works great.  The guys in the department love them for looking at prints and other things - they use them along with their prescription glasses as well.,3
5,Brand New! I absolutely Love this pure cold pressed Castor Oil!!  Delivered as scheduled. Extremely Satisfied customer. Thank you! :),3
5,A dear friend from France sent this to me for my Birthday. I love the fact he found something I wanted on my wish list. Awesome idea Amazon!  This soap is just wonderful... and you get 6 bars which will last a long time. Super product...,3
4,"Ive been using this product on and off now for about 2 years. there are some downsides but there are some upsides too...first you must learn how to use it to get best results, so play around with it a little to get a feel for it... I found that DABBING with my fingers makes a world of a difference, start in the middle and work your way out in a circular \\""dabbing\\"" motion, repeat for deeper color(rubbing can give uneven results if you dont blend well)For the stickiness feeling, it will pass but...if you cant wait for that, i dust on some face powder and problem solved without it affecting color. The result you will get from this gel is a sheer natural looking flush on skin. Blushing bride i think is a safe color for most light to medium skin tones. Now the downside is 2 things: the price is high i would say and the packaging is a little messy,(it comes in a push up stick that tends to leak a bit on the sides)Other than than im very satisfied with product, ive never broken out from using it. At first it was a bit challenging to get the hang of it, but once you get past that point, you will have incredible results with skin that looks radiant and glowing.",3
5,"I have long wavy hair with long layers. The texture is not fine, but fairly thin strands (naturally blonde). I expected this stuff to weigh my hair down but it does not. I am on my third bottle of each, and I can't say that in my lifetime I have ever re-ordered or re-purchased a shampoo brand with such dedication.  I haven't found the need to switch occasionally to another shampoo for residue issues either. Really, hands down, this stuff is the best.  It defines my waves, gets rid of frizz without being heavy, doesn't get in the way of volume, and smells absolutely wonderful. My stylist noticed a difference in the health of my hair as well. He asked if I had stopped blow-drying.    This particular set comes with a brush and a bag. I haven't found much use for the bag, but the brush is solid and a great bonus.",3
5,Works as advertized. Strong wooden handle.,3
5.0,Worth every penny ~,3
4,"This is a very good product. Works as advertised. Sharp blades, powerful quiet motor. My only drawback on it is the attachment is kind of difficult to remove and put back on...and I normally wouldn't be removing it too often, but the way it is made (unlike my last one), you have to remove the attachment quite often when cutting hair with it because the hair wont just fall or shake out like you would like-therefore you find yourself tussling with removing and putting the attachment back on to get the hair out. After you get used to that aspect of it, it is a very good product.",3
4,Worked very well,3
5,"Replaced my Sensotouch 3D with this shaver since Philips ruined what was a great shaver, the 3D, with &#34;new Improved replacement head&#34; that is horrible.  I guess this is considered a step back from the 3D but the quality of the shave is equal to the 3D even when it had the original head, and absolutely kills the 3D now that the original replacement head for it is not available any longer.  I noticed that this shaver is now out of stock and Amazon does not know if or when it will be available once again, so I guess Philips is doing everything they can to force people to buy their $200 - $350 models, but the day I would do that is the day I will just stop by the barber shop daily and get a top quality shave.  I can do that many times before that would total $350.  If they eliminate all their shavers that cost less, maybe some folks will stick with them regardless of price, but I'm not one of them. I've used a rotary shaver for the past 20 years and have always counted on Norelco, but if this razor konks out, I'll be trying some other brands and options.  It's sad to see Philips falling into the greedy mold like so many other companies have, but I guess stockholder dividends are driving the train now with them, too.  Please excuse the editorial comments, I'll get back to the 4500..if you can find it somewhere I would advise you to buy it before they all disappear, because this shaver delivers a nice, close, comfortable shave every single day.  I don't use gel or shaving cream since going to all that trouble was why I gave up on a razor, but for years I have used a pre-shave lotion to help get my beard ready for a close clipping.  Not Williams Lectric Shave or some watery substance, but an actual lotion that truly helps, like Afta pre-electric or even a house brand of CVS that is comparable to Afta, but has a much more noticeable aroma.  Applying that and allowing it to dry helps make shaving with the 4500 a real pleasure for me just as it did with the Sensotouch3D in its earlier days.  I prefer plugging the cord directly into the razor rather than into a stand and the case for my 3D fits this razor well for travel so those two issues are not a problem for me. The price is really reasonable and all things considered, it's an excellent shaver.  I highly recommend it if you can find it.  It's a winner and I'd be amazed if you can find a comparable shaver in this price range.",3
5,"Fantastic product. I have looked for a solution to chapped lips for years.  This product is not gooey or sticky and when applied it simply works. Live in dry, mountain climate.",3
5,I love these products. You polish your nail and in less than 10 minutes you are out the door!<br />This color Cake Pop is one of the perfect mates to the Cream Puff or Cityscape color.,3
5,Great product!  It is great for getting rid of dry skin on the face. Very hard to get in the stores.  Forget trying to look for it. You should just order from Amazon.,3
5.0,This covers under eye darkness better tan any other brand.,3
5,BEST SHAMPOO EVER! it totally worth the price! i can't use any other shampoo this totally transform my hair and if you use it with the mask is even better,3
5,"I love this stuff (Orange Gelee) and since they developed it almost a hundred years ago, hopefully do not test this specific product, but I ws shocked to read that this is happening wanted to inform for all who care....",3
4,it's one of my favorite fragrances,3
5,"Had one of these many years ago, and when I needed a new one....I couldn't find one as I think they didn't make them anymore.  Found this one and just used it the other day......wow.  Like a hot knife thru butter.....and for under $30.",3
5,"I'm new to nail art so it will take some patience, but this does exactly what I expected.  Thx for the prompt service.",3
5,"This is a beautiful artificial rose, suitable for hair, hat, waistband...Nice size (fits in palm of hand); beautifully tinted in favorite, lush shades of coral-pinks, just as I'd hoped. I like that it can either be afixed with its pin or clip; I'll use the clip to attach it to a black straw, wide-brimmed hat for summer function -- perfect! It was packed sensibly and arrived uncrushed. Certainly would buy again.",3
5,"This is the absolute perfect pink nail color out there! It is a pretty pastel pink but is not overwhelming. Perfect for every day wear. I even wear this color all winter long because it is clean looking, classy and timeless.",3
4,"The wig came early and was what I expected.  This wig easily stood being straightened with 180 degrees Fahrenheit, allowing me to get a nice, straight wig.  It should work out well because its long and light.  My only complaint is that it's more yellow than the picture, especially in different lighting.  For an gamble, it worked out well.    Note:  This wig can't be dyed using RIT powder dye.  The pigment just washes off.",3
5,These are sharp.... Works great for larger cuts.... But not so good for cutting very small hardened polymer canes if you want thin cuts because the top edge where you put your fingers is thicker than the blade,3
5,Great hold without being too &#34;crunchy&#34;.I've tried lots of different brands of mousse on my fine hair and this is my favorite.,3
5,"[[VIDEOID:d4d5cfe8c1adc345d5658404bcea841e]]I have the EARTH scent - there are all four \\""Elements\\"" available on the same product page, so be sure you are clicked into the scent you are interested in before hitting that Shopping Cart!<br /><br />My video is mainly just to highlight a small issue I had with the caps - one that the bottle comes with and a pump-style cap.<br /><br />I love this stuff - warm, woody, spicy yet powdery soft all the while being entirely masculine.  Pretty quick skin absorption as well.  After a few minutes, my hands are moisturized without any greasiness.  I constantly handle tablets and camcorders, so zero greasiness is a major aspect.  :)<br /><br />I did receive this as a review sample, but I am personally sold.  Once this bottle is finished, I shall be back for more!  Perhaps even try out one of the other scents.",3
5,"This is the real deal, and for a great deal.  My teeth get SUPER sensitive when whitening, however, so I have to go at it real slow.  (Forget wearing this overnight - I'd probably wake up and never smile again).  It's no fault of the product - my teeth just seem to be extra sensitive.<br /><br />The only issue with the two-pack is that I have a ton left over, so unless you can handle massive doses of peroxide and want a smile that is reminiscent of lightning, plan on splitting it with a spouse, significant-other, friend, sibling, random stranger with yellow teeth...you get the idea.<br /><br />Good stuff - buy it and get whiter teeth.",3
4.0,Awesome product!!!,3
5,"I love it, it is really clean and gentle,do not let your skin drying.From now no,it will be my only gentle cleaning milk,if Ican get it.",3
5,"Definitely recommend this as your first alum block. Works great, is cheap, and is very easy to keep clean. Must have for any new shaver.",3
5,"Ordered this based on the positive reviews, it is a nice topping for cereal or yogurt. I can't rate the health claims as we only use it like wheat germ but it has a great flavor and texture.      I agree with the other reviewers who pointed out the packaging needs improvement and it is a kind of pricy substitute for wheat germ. Outside of that a good product. Recommended.",3

5.0,"I've had flat irons before, but decided it was time for an upgrade.  The HSI has been working great for me.  I don't mind the dial heat setting, it gets to the point...hot,hotter,etc.  Prior to the HSI, I've never used an oil on my hair for a flat iron.  This has also been working well for me.  My hair is naturally unruly, and with other products my hair would start to frizz by mid-day.  With the HSI, my har stays smooth all day long, and it's been very humid lately.  I'm very pleased with this product and would recommend it to a friend.",3
5,"I must be allergic to lipstick because any brand makes my lips peel - I'm constantly chewing the skin off.  Ghastly.  I began using this product, wearing it under my lipstick, and I no longer have this problem.  It does moisturize and it wear well.  I like purchasing 3 at a time so I have one for the vanity, one for my purse, and an extra when I begin to run out.",3
5,"The following includes my process and results: I have several moles on my face, some large. I have had them looked at by a dermatologist and they were fine. I did have a mole on my neck that looked like it needed to be biopsied (spelling)and the so called trained dermatologists took a blade and hacked at my neck. I have a dark scar now in the shape of an apostrophe. So, needless to say, I did not want to go back to them again nor did I want to fork over big $$ for a surgeon to remove the ones on my face. I did research and read reviews for this product for nearly a year and the only real complaint that I read said that the moles sometimes reappear. That right there is not enough to scare me away. Who cares! So I bought this Dermatend product last April along with the healing balm. * I used a brand new unused cheap nail file (not the metal ones) and I rubbed at my mole. Not just the top, but I made sure to do all the sides (since it was a raised mole). I actually counted to ten with each side. Not hard! you dont want to make it bleed but you do want to rub it to kind of break the first layer of skin - thats the best way I know how to describe that. I immediately took a very warm wet washcloth to clean the mole. The heat stung the mole which let me know I did penetrate the skin. I applied vaseline to my skin surrounding the mole so the Dermatend would not get on my skin. I applied the Dermatend to the mole. I tried to apply it with a q-tip but it was easier with my finger. (Wash your finger immediately after). I felt stinging immediately. The pain is not unbearable. Im sure a child would not be able to stand it but they don't usually like splinters removed either. I left the Dermatend on the area for 4-5min longer than the recommended time on the tube. I washed the dermatend and the Vaseline off of my face and applied the healing balm. Immediately you can see that the Dermatend has an affect on the mole. I applied the healing balm with a q-tip 2 to 3 times a day to the mole and the area around it because it appeared to be reddish in tint like it was irritated. I have very sensitive skin, so much so that I can't use a lot of products. The mole scabbed up within days. It just looked like my mole was now black. The healing balm is shiny and to someone else it may look like you have snot on the area. I really didnt go out in public for the first week but you can cover it with a bandaid. Do NOT skip applying the healing balm!!!!!! On the 9th day, my scab fell off. I so wanted to pick it off but I know if i did it would leave a scar. Be strong! When the scab fell off there was a small hole that was whitish which led me to believe it was still healing. I kept applying the balm for 2-3 times a day. It has healed up very nicely. 2 - 3 weeks after scab fell off I switched to Bio oil because theyre good at preventing scars. It has now been about a 5 - 6 weeks since my scab fell off and it is healed and nearly the same color as the rest of my skin. there is a light pink outline of one fourth of a circle on my skin but Im still applying BioOil everyday and it should fade within the next week or so. Even if it doesn't it is so small and so light I can cover it with makeup which is waaaaaaaay better than dealing with the mole that I had. I would definitely recommend using this. I had another mole I applied it to (it was actually my first mole), kind of an experiment in an inconspicuous spot. I did not use the file to all the sides so there is a raised area left. That is why with the 2nd mole (the process I described above) I rubbed all sides while counting to like 10 or 15. and it worked. It is a tad bit expensive but it works if you follow the directions. Its not difficult. There are even pictures in the small pamphlet. Well worth the money. Save up if you have to. I did and Im happier when I look in the mirror.",3
5,Have been using this product for years and love it. Keeps skin soft. Suggest putting on immediately after patting dry following your shower. Careful using it in the tub or could get slippery.,3
4,Kind of a must have for those who wear pinks or purples. this is a standard base. no complaints. smooth application. it is not bright & has a slight shimmer built in.,3
5.0,"I love this product for tanning because you never feel dried out afterward. I really believe the 12 hour moisturizing claim!

5,Great if you have dry skin. Doesn't leave you looking oily. You can see it working after one use and you'll never want to stop using it!,3
5,"Nadinola is a must have for all those experiencing hyperpigmentation. It fades marks, acne scars and other hyperpigmentation marks effectively. You should folow this application with a good sunscreen.",3
5,"I love, love this flat iron. I have owned many Chi's and this by far surpasses the Chi flat iron in every way!!! The Karmin flat iron does not burn your hair at all what so ever and it really makes it  shinny! I was worried that this flat iron was to good to be true, but it truly works! This price is a bit more that the Chi's, but worth every penny extra. You cannot go wrong with this flat iron.",3
5.0,"I absolutely love this product! The hold is greater and stronger than a gel or wax, but doesn't have that heavy feeling, and leaves a wonderful shine! I usually run a comb through it for a classic or a brush for a James Dean look. Also, the smell is the best ever! A clean, masculine scent with hints of spice and lime that radiates off of you.",3
4,"I purchased this less than a year ago. I use it almost every day. My problem is that I have had this product only 5 months and it doesn't work. It isn't a good design, I have had difficulty replacing the battery and the wire that connects the battery to the product has become loose.  I have placed an order in for a new device. It cost more, I hope the design is better. I didn't realize it had only been 5 months. Do you have any recommendations?  :( Thank you. jckykng@sbcglobal.net",3
4,"I have to get used to the texture and the smell at first. It is gritty, and It smells like burnt nut. However, to my surprise, my skin was really soft after I used it.

4,I don't know why it took me so long to get one of these. I like them when I travel and a hotel has one in the bathroom. It just never occurred to me that perhaps I should get one for home. Works great. I used extra sturdy wall inserts to screw into. I didn't want it falling off.,3
4,I'm pretty pleased with this product. I really like that it's based on natural and or organic materials. I have noticed a big difference in fine lines and my over all skin tone. Does this without drying. Would by again!,3
5,The price on this item cannot be beat----the service is great----packaging was very adequate----Over  all I am very pleased with the item,3
4,"This Remington Shaver provides a close and adequate shave.  It has a long battery life.  It seems like I have gotten more than the advertised 60 minutes of battery life.  I have been using it almost every morning since receiving it six weeks ago, and I have yet to need to recharge it.  Lights beside numbers printed on the plastic housing show the battery life remaining.  The pop up trimmer works fine to trim sideburns.  It compares favorably with my more expensive Panasonic ES1803 Wet/Dry Shaver.  This Remington shaves just as well.  On the con side, the Remington is bulkier and heavier; I would not prefer it for travel.  But for a rechargeable shaver to use at home, this is a quality and economical choice.",3
4,"I guess I don't know what light ash brown is?  All the browns seem very dark to me.<br /><br />After the first week and a half (daily washing) it was about were i wanted it.<br /><br />Maybe I need  to do what the directions say... a test strip, although I'm not sure that would have been enough to give me the info I needed.  I do like it now.  I would by it again, but not leave it in so long.  Maybe 20 minutes instead of 30.",3
5,"Great spray for styling.  You can poof your hair out, make it look like second day hair.  Just spray it in and play with your hair. I use my hands and then a comb to slightly go over the outside.  Helps make my hair look fuller.  I highly recommend this product (just try to get it on sale as it is pricey)",3
4,"Finally a holder for all my different sized bottles. Each holder has 3 slots and each of the slots is a different shape and size. The only bottles that don't stay put real well at an angle are my tiny bottles, like Bon Bons, and the really big bottles like Revlon. But they do stay in so no worries. Love them and wish I had them years ago. Also they are quit big and therefor very stably; will not tip over.",3

5,"I've tried several dry shampoos and I've always hated them. This is the only one that doesn't leave white powder residue and it actually smells lovely! My fiance asked what I was wearing because he thought it was perfume. It's very nice and it works very well. I use to refresh my hair after a workout if I'm on the run. My hair is usually fine and oily, but this is a miracle fix. They don't sell it in stores anymore.<br /><br />LOVE IT! t",3
5,Black Shatter is great if you apply it right:    1. Make sure your base coat is COMPLETELY dry.  2. Apply a VERY THIN layer of the shatter polish to the nail just once.   3. When it drys (very quickly) add a clear top coat.,3
5,"I love these tweezers! They have a great color, finish, and the angel of the actual tweezing part! I've used them once on my eyebrows, and it was way better than the pair I own now. I really like that the cover at the end is thick enough plastic to keep on them, and keep them from getting dirty. It's difficult to find tweezers I actually am willing to use, but these ones are great! Even though I got them for free to review, I would surly buy them again if I had to!",3
4,"I like this eyeliner because it applies very well to my lower and upper waterlines. Charcoal pencils don't work well for me and neither do liquid liners. The texture of this is in-between, like a cream stick or moist charcoal pencil. The color is spot on and it lasts throughout the day for me. I've been on the lookout for a more natural eyeliner that works on waterlines but so far, I haven't found one. Until I do, this Maybelline eyeliner will remain the last non-natural piece of makeup in my collection.",3

5,"I've used many many dry shampoos and this one is my all time favorite!! It does everything a dry shampoo needs to do; removes oil, odor, and adds fullness to your hair. I have to say that this dry shampoo adds more fullness to my hair than any other dry shampoo and possibly even makes my hair look more full than when I actually style it clean! The way I use it is; part off hair into sections and spray it directly on the root. Then I take my finger tips and massage it into my scalp. I then let it sit for a while (I usually do my make up here) and go back with a brush and brush it through to the ends and my hair is back to it's normal looking state with lots of volume and no gross oil separations!! If you like to use dry shampoos to preserve your color, or because you don't like to wash your hair every day, this dry shampoo will work wonderful! And the best part is it is not super expensive!!",3
4,"I think they work well, but I didn't realize that it was a peel. I thought that I could just keep them bedside and use them to clean my face when I wanted. With these, you have to time them and then rinse them off - like any peel. I just thought they were different. That being said. I really like them. I have combination, and sensitive skin and these worked really well. Left my skin glowing after the first use!",3
4,"Moisturizes well, but the scent is so light it disappears in minutes. Smells good, but the scent disappears too fast. I got it very cheap so I was okay with it. I highly recommend the regular lotion in this scent over the triple moisture body cream. The scent on the regular lotion in this scent last a very long time unlike this product, but overall this one moisturizes better if that's what you're looking for.",3
4,"I use Almay mascara since my eyes seem to be a little sensitive to mascara. This particular type of Almay works fine, but does get a bit flaky after wearing all day. The 2 pack was a very good deal.",3

5,"I originally bought a combination pack of almost all the serums and gels. Before I ordered, I requested an ingredients list of all their Vitamin C serums, since they didn't have it on their web site yet, to compare the ingredients to Skinceuticals and just for my information so I know what's in it. They promptly sent me one and I was VERY pleased with the ingredients and  how they compared to Skinceuticals. They are virtually the same only Cosmetic Skin Solutions is WAY more affordable!!!!!  After trying the Vitamin C serums, I am very happy with those.<br /><br />After using the Vitamin C Serums for a while, they started to get darker and darker. It had been a long time since I bought them when I emailed Cosmetic Skin Solutions to ask if it was ok to use them still. I received a prompt reply the next day in my email account telling me that the Vitamin C serums have a shelf life of about 6 months and was told NOT to use them after that and definitely not when they have become oxidized and are turning darker. I was told that it is best to use a fresh batch for no more than about 6 months. I was using all 3 of them at the same time and had only gone through about half of each. Since I bought the more than $200 package and because I was unaware of the shelf life, they told me they would send me 3 fresh bottles to replace the ones that had gone bad! I had hoped for something like that but I didn't even ask because I just didn't think they would really do that. They offered to do it for me!!!!!!!! I have to say that in a world of good customer service becoming a rarity, I am SOOOOOO happy with Cosmetic Skin Solutions not only for their wonderful products but also for their OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Thank you CSS!!!  :)",3

5,"I have very curly and somewhat fine hair that tends to be frizzy without products. I started using this conditioner along with the Dr. Bronner's Organic Shikakai Body Soap on my hair and love them both. Don't let the brown color of these products scare you off, it's not significant at all. They work really well for me, and  they smell wonderful. I would definitely recommend this Conditioning Hair Rinse to anyone.",3

Amazing.  2. Unscented, Unrefined = Pure Product.    3. It is certified fair trade product that is also cruelty free, which is hard to find in the cosmetics industry.  It is up to consumers to demand that products AND their production processes are ethical and harm free.   4. It is perfect for toting around. It comes in a durable circular tin that fits wonderfully into bags and purses and will not spill or pop open accidentally while biking, flying, busing, or hiking around.  I can moisturize anywhere, anytime.   5. The Ojoba Collective business model is inspiring and progressive and that makes my moisturizing moments even more enjoyable.",3

I'm using a Wet and Wild polish which makes all the differenence between the Konad polishes and cheap polishes. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a fun design on your nail.     To make the design more suble, use a metallic polish over a base or plain nail. This will make the design faint but still fun.     Absolutely love these designs! I find myself using this plate more than most of the others I have.",3

4,"So far, this is the best and most efficient hair dryer I have ever owned.<br />For women of color, or women with natural hair, if you struggle with using a rounded hair brush and a traditional hair dryer, this is a life-saver! The &#34;comb&#34; attachment can be used directly on the hair to comb through to dry. The edges are thick and rounded so it isn't like a comb in the sense of you having to worry about it snagging your hair. It can be easily detached for cleaning or to replace with the traditional attachment that is also included with this dryer if you did want to use it with a rounded brush for more bounce. The attachments can also be rotated with the press of handy little push buttons on the side so that you can rotate the attachment and not your hand in some awkward position.<br /><br />My only complaint with this dryer is that it only has two settings, high and low, and once your hair starts to get closer to dry, hot feels really hot. So you must be careful and switch to low or you could really burn yourself and/or damage your hair. I would give this a 5 if there was a medium setting, but other than that, I could not imagine using a different hair dryer when I have to do my hair on my on and I have a lot of it and it is very thick. This hair dryer works fast, and I can usually have my hair dried in about 15 mins if I am not doing complex styling.",3
5,"...and I'm glad this DMS melange had the product, not only that, it was fulfilled quickly, but the shipping and handling was ridiculous.<br />Unjustifiable.<br />For four lipliners, smaller than four writing pencils, shipping first class for a small envelope was 19.96.<br />The cost of the product I purchased was 4 @ 9.00 = 36.00 + 19.96 shipping.<br />Terrible. Most retailers allow for multiple purchases, not here.<br /><br />I ultimately did make the decision to purchase, so shame on me, but only did so because I'd looked at every other resource to purchase this item from -  and I could not find any substitute of similar color.<br />I really would try very hard to avoid this supplier in the future due to their high shipping & handling costs.<br />A shame - but great product.<br />The product quality is sort of moot since the product has been discontinued and DMS Melange has bought up most of the stock and is making a profit on shipping.",3

5,"I've been using this product for just over 2 months, on the advice of a stylist at the Devachan Salon.  I made the mistake of highlighting my hair this past summer and I'm paying for it now in the form of dry sections of hair that don't want to curl :-(  The stylist at the salon used this product in conjunction with the One conditioner from the same line.  The results were impressive.  I, like most curly-haired girls, have several different curl patterns and some parts of my hair are straighter than others.  I was skeptical that anything would help to encourage better formed curls in those areas, but this combo did it.  Because some of my hair was damaged from the highlighting, I was advised to use Heaven in Hair as part of my daily routine.  It doesn't take much, so an 8-ounce jar has lasted me the full two months and I'm likely to get another 2 weeks out of it...and that's with daily use.  The tricks to maximizing the product are: 1) use it on sopping wet hair; 2) apply dime-sized dollops one at a time, drying your hands between applications; and 3) rub the dime-sized dollop between your hand and watch it magically increase in volume.  This is where most people mess up.  If you do this, you'll use less product, which results in a better look and saves you money in the end.  Occasionally, I add a little One conditioner to \\""finish\\"" my hair in the shower and then comes the scrunching.  Flip your hair and scrunch like mad.  Never use a comb or a brush (I didn't believe it either, but it's true) and NEVER use a towel; instead blot or wrap with a t-shirt. Towels break curly hair and contribute to frizz. You can air dry, but I find that 10 mins under a dryer (table top or stand dryer, low-med setting) makes a huge difference in curl definition.  You can also use a diffuser on a low setting.  You don't want to blow the hair around, that would encourage frizz.  Sound like alot?  I thought so too, but in reality, I was doing just as much work to keep my naturally curly hair straight and I was paranoid about humidity, rain, etc.  I spent a ton of money on anti-frizz serums (silicone-based and really bad for your hair), anti-frizz shampoos and conditioners, gels, sprays, and so on and I STILL got frizz, even with my curly hair. Now, I laugh at the weather and give it not another thought.

5,"This is the perfect thing to control daily oil build-up on your face, and also keeps a matte finish look as well.  Use in the morning, and maybe around lunch, and you're good to go.  Since it's so good at absorbing oil, getting rid of blemishes, and also acne disappears with use, I use it daily.  You can also \\""touch up\\"" before your picture is taken, and it will hide reddish blemishes as well because it's tinted.  Highly recommend.  There aren't many products that do these things this well.",3
5.0,"So far so good. We got this for trimming the kids hair and for easier grooming of my facial hair. I have a battery operated trimmer that just doesn't stay charged well enough and this was a must. The cape is very cheap, I would recommend getting a higher quality cape if you are going to cut a lot of hair.",3
5,Bought for myself and has helped.  Absorbs fast and cuticles are softer. But a bit pricey normally (had a discount code). Don't know if I'll buy refill or other indie makers cuticle oil.,3
5,"This parfum literally smells like cookies :)  I know it's a little strange, but I love it.  It lasts for a long time too.",3
5,"I have very sensitive Irish skin. If I shave, my face will be red and sore all day. If I wash my face, it'd red and sore for half the day, and usually my face will be peeling everywhere; If I open my mouth to talk or eat, skin would literally shed.<br />My scalp was always super dry on the right side, and would flake endlessly when I ran a comb through it.<br />My beard and mustache looked dull and I could never get the hair to sit flat or in the direction I wanted. If I combed it too close to my skin, I'd get beard-druff everywhere.<br />I've tried so many shampoo's, face washes, essential oils, moisturizers, completely organic products, etc over the years; nothing has ever helped my incredibly dry, irritated skin until Dr Bronners!<br /><br />I've been reading on beard forums about Dr Bronners being this miracle soap that has not only helped them achieve awesome facial hair, but also was their \\""all-in-one\\"" face/hair/body wash routine. Dr Bronners name kept popping up everywhere on these forums, so after 2 years I finally decided to seek some out and try it...<br /><br />I've only been using Dr Bronners Peppermint bar soap for 2 weeks on my body, face, beard, and hair(aka everywhere!), and my skin looks awesome. No more redness, itchiness, or flaking on my face. My face has peeled unpredictably off and on for years, at least 4 days a week, so I'm really happy that so far this is doing amazing things for my skin. I'm hoping my skin wont get bored of this stuff and suddenly decide it wants to stop working.<br /><br />My hair is a couple of shades lighter now, and the dandruff is almost completely gone. It's hard to explain the effect it has on my super thin, receding, naturally oily dark brown hair; it feels squeaky clean and looks soft with a little bit of shine. It has a dry clean look,not an \\""oh man, this stuff is too dry and eating up all my natural oils\\"" type of thing like I read in some reviews. It has more volume, looks and feels weightless, and just looks waydifferent and healthy.<br /><br />My beard/mustache no longer get beard-druff, and my facial hair looks thicker, healthier, and easily combs in the directions I want.<br /><br />I don't notice a \\""tingling\\"" sensation like so many of my friends and reviewers brag about(they said it's especially noticeable and nice \\""down there\\""), or much of a scent, but that's not important.<br />This stuff lathers so well on your hands or a wash cloth, that all it takes is rubbing it for 2 seconds between your hands, and I have enough soap to lather my whole body, face, and head. It significantly cut down on my showering time, so I guess it'll save me money on my water bill...<br /><br />...Which leads me to one of the only cons I can think of...<br /><br />Con: This stuff is about $3.80 a bar on Amazon, $4.75 at my local Target. Most people are use to paying about 50cents a bar for department store soaps like Irish Spring, so this can be an overwhelming leap in price. Reviews mention it being a rip-off. Is it? Who knows. I don't make soap for a living. Maybe the world is so accustomed to buying soap made with low quality ingredients, churned out in massive factories where employee's aren't making a living wage, and corners are being cut at every turn. Maybe Dr Bronners isnt expensive - maybe the other stuff is underpriced.<br />All I know is for people like me with unpredictable, sensitive, irritated skin, this stuff seems to work. If I have to spend more money to finally get healthy skin and confidence, then so be it.<br />If you dont have skin problems and are doing just fine with your current products and routine, then I honestly see no point in using this soap, unless you think your skin has a little bit of room for improvement, or you're very curious what the fuss is about.<br />For me, it's been a world of difference, so I'll keep using it and telling all my bearded friends about it.",3
4,"I've been wearing this perfume since it first came out and was severely disappointed when it was discontinued. It has a nice light scent that is a little sharp and is suitable for all times of day, including school and work. I was very glad to find this on amazon and hope that the next time I run out I will be able to buy here again.",3
4,"Works pretty well, wish it had a little more power though.",3
4,I had these when I was a teenager. My hair has gotten thinner so they didn't work for me and I didn't like them. I will give them to a friend with longer thicker hair. Still a good product.,3
5,Nice,3
5,The lotion has a wonderful smell of vanilla with background scent of fig.  The lotion is quickly absorbed into the skin and does not leave a greasy feeling,3
4,"Pretty decent tweezers. I like them. I wish they picked up a little better on difficult hairs, but they did their job for my brows and are my travel pair. Definitely pleased!",3
4,"This stuff works really well, I think it exfoliated my face too much when I put it on with coconut oil what looked like a lot of skin started coming off as I was rubbing, leaving my face dry for a few days, but I had a brown spot on my white skin which looked to be the beginning signs of skin cancer and wanted to take care of it before it got worse as I got older, it was a very dry patch of skin and every time I use it it got better, hardly dry now as even I do not use it regularly because I forget, but even though I believe it is working, I will continue to use it.",3
4,"This is the perfect depth, and it lets you get a great lather. I really enjoy shaving with this bowl and it really just is a solid, no frills shave cup. The soap it comes with is alright, but I don't really like it, so that's why I dinged it a star. Maybe I'm being harsh, I just wish I could have bought it without the soap.",3
5,"I was fed up with my nail polish chipping, over acrylics so tried UV polish...loved it - nail polish that stays shiny and does not chip off for at least 2 weeks - what was not so appealing was the fact that it cost $40 plus tip locally!<br /><br />After doing some research I decided to purchase the CND Shellac nail polish / base coat and top coat which require a UV lamp to set the colors. I paid $180 for all items - polish and lamp which is not bad, as by polish number 5 I will be saving my cash!<br /><br />CND has an official lamp with a rather high price tag, so I saw this, reviews looked good so decided to give it a try!<br /><br />It has three settings: 2 minutes, 3 minutes and constant. It also does come with the three bulbs it needs (be careful as they are tucked away in the box and I almost missed them!<br />It is a good size - you can fit two hands or two feet in at the same time so it allows you to complete your UV process much faster! Similar lamps tend to be smaller - and more expensive!<br /><br />It works perfectly for these UV polish systems and set my color just fine with no need for a repeat cure. Your nails will feel tacky at the end of the process, but simply follow directions, wipe your nails with an alcohol pad and you will be good to go - the lamp does the trick perfectly.<br /><br />If you are looking for a UV lamp to use with UV polish systems, this is a great choice - good price, several settings, and large enough to cut time off your mani's!<br /><br />UPDATE: 4 years later this is still going strong, I have yet to replace a bulb  -I use myabe 20 or or times a year for reference, so based on the price and the fact this this has stood up well over time; it is a great pick!",3
5.0,This shadestick primer works like magic. Put this on under your eyeshadow and you will not have to worry about your makeup for the rest of the day.,3
5,My dog has allergies and the vet recommended this product.  The vet suggested that I give her one drop in each one or two times a day as needed.  The dog tolerates the frogs and they help relieve some of her allergy symptoms.,3
5,"A friend bleached her hair, he hair was natually dark brown....<br />her hair ended up being this ugly orange color, she bleached it again and it was orange/yellow..... well more yellow<br />and we put this in her hair and her hair was no longer yellow or orange, it was a very light blonde.<br /><br />Pretty decent considering what her hair looked like before!",3
4,good,3
4,great brush for liquid foundation,3
5,"I have used Strivectin-SD in the past, but hadn't previously purchased it with SPF protection. As with the original version, I'm very satisfied with the results and feel that it's one of the best facial moisturizers I've used.",3
5,"This iron is easy to operate and works quite well.  Like the adjustable heat setting.  Comes with a travel bag, too.",3
5.0,Thank you thank you!!  I have tried to find Satin Rosewood 295 lipcolor forever.  This is the best lipcolor!  I totally love it and don't want anyother because it stays on all day and does not bleed around the lip area.  I was so disappointed when going to store after store looking for it and it just seemed to disappear. But was so excited when I googled and were able to purchase from you.,3
5,This is a great oil,3
5,Cute and lasted me a full week.,3
5,This is about having a condition that requires something that works and being able to get it from someone who sells it for a reasonable price.  This product meets all those standards.,3
4,"I have very wavy, slightly frizzy hair with 2c/3a curls.  I like sea salt sprays for &#34;2nd day hair,&#34; where my hair is not shower-clean but I need to revive the curl.  Here's what I do:  I spray my hair all over with water and finger-comb, then mist with a leave-in conditioner and finger-comb again.  I then apply a VERY LIGHT MIST of this to both top hair and under-layers, and scrunch.  It turns flat areas into waves and waves into spiral curls, and adds the perfect amount of texture and holds all day.  I think that people who have problems with this spray (or any sea salt spray) are simply using too much, or using it on dry hair.  I love the smell of this product but the price is a bit too high for regular use.  I use the L'Oreal TXT-it spray and have a small bottle of NYMBB for traveling.  They work about the same but this smells better.",3
5,I absolutely love Moroccan Oil.  My hair is real thick and dry.  The oil makes it shine and more manageable to work with,3
4,I wish it came with tweezers because you really need them. But They are exactly what I was looking for. I will order agian.,3
4,"Got mine in the mail today. It took exactly 2 weeks and 3 days to get here. Which was a lot better than what the expected delivery date said(June 6th - June 28th) They're super cute, soft,and stretchy. My little girl isn't due until July so I can't review on how they are on baby yet. Yes, some of the colors of the flowers do not exactly match the bands but the colors still look cute together. The light blue with the seafoam does look a little odd and clashes quite a bit but for the price this is well worth it, especially since I can't even find a 2 pack of these at any store for less than 5$. The packaging it came in was good. It didn't squish none of them up or ruin any of them either like I seen some other reviews say. Worth what you pay forsure (:",3
4,"I have had this 7340xl model and the 7310xl model for over a year. Both originally shaved good. The 7340xl was better for longer hairs if I forgot to shave for 2 days or more since it has a mixed slotted screen to pick up those longer hairs but a disadvantage of tending to pull off too many skin cells if left in one place too long with the slotted screen. The 7310xl has the smoother screen with less ability to pick up the long hairs but it works fine for daily shaves with less skin burning if left in one spot too long. I thought both were good with the floating screens but their exists a problem that emerges over time.<br /><br />After 1 year the two shavers heads became dull and replacement cost of the head almost equals cost of complete razor and heads if on sale.<br /><br />The solution is to revert to the old shaver technology prior to floating heads. Many of us have had the older norelco shavers. I first watched a traveling guy who would go to towns and \\""tune up\\"" their old norelco shavers. This consisted of light removing of hairs and a drop of oil along with the most important task of sharpening the heads.<br /><br />How did he do it? Quite simply by pressing the metal screen against a hairless finger tip or palm of this hand. Now you just need to apply this to your shaver. But wait. You have a floating head which prevents the force needed to push metal against metal (screen and rotating shavers).<br /><br />Solution: Remove the plastic that isolates the 3 heads, rinse in water, dry, apply glue of choice (I used cyanoacrylate) and then I waited 30 minutes and reinserted into shaver. This prevents the heads from moving much. Next turn on the shaver and apply finger pressure to one head at a time. After a few minutes all 3 heads are close to as sharp as new and your finished.<br /><br />Life is a risk and your walk may not end as well as mine. Hope you have a good journey and good luck.<br /><br />P.S. If I were a manufacturer of shavers. Putting in floating heads to prevent sharpening while flaunting the virtues of going around facial obstacles with less chance of nicking skin is and was a brilliant idea.",3
4,I bought these to replace my old ones after 26 years.  They are very nice and super light.   I love that this set has only medium and large and they heat up pretty quickly...  I never  use the small ones in my old set so they were wasted.  The clips that come with the rollers do not grasp well at all.  I'm using Conair Hot Roller Clips (with teeth) that I purchased for my old set.  They hold great!  This set is really nice.,3
5,The way the latch snaps back under the protruding bit you use to fasten in the hair allows you to save the light to use later.,3
5,Bought as a gift. It's so adorable! I hope my goddaughter likes it as much as I do. I even bought my son the monkey one,3
5,I received a free bottle from Influenster in my Viva Vox Box and I could not be happier. It is easy to apply when I'm in a rush and the smell is so calming and relaxing. In no way it is greasy and my skin looks great. I would totally purchase this product for my family.,3
5,Great Product,3
5,"Received everything promptly and sealed.  I've had different mascara that has made my eyelashes long and this product is comparable. I always put powder on my eyelashes before I apply mascara for extra llength, but this mascara seems to extend my eyelashes well also.",3
4,Great lashes! They look great! Not really reusable. .but for the price very satisfied.,3
4,"I do like the way my skin feel and looks : fresh, even coverage.  It's not thick or heavy. It lasts all day, which is a plus!  Great price, too!",3
5,"wow its smaller than i thought it was gonna be, but its worked out because it's a perfect fit for my pinky finger xD",3
5,Works great. Lasts long enough to get the job done +. Recommend to those who might think about buying this product.,3
5,Awesome palette at a great price. These save me so much storage space for my makeup. It fits 35 standard round eye shadows or 12 Mac sized blushes.,3
5,Excellent good price,3
5,Just what the doctor ordered.  Received when promised!!,3
5,"It works great, and the battery never wears out (because it doesn't have one!).  I got really tired of replacing my otherwise-still-functional beard trimmer every 2-4 years when the battery pooched out.  This one is small, heavy and cuts through my beard with no problems at all.  None of that pulling that you get with battery trimmers when they're not fully charged.  Great product.",3

5.0,love this set,3
5,I used another brand my entire life until I got a sample of Colgate Total from my dentist. I switched the same day and have never looked back. This is a great product especially the tartar control!,3
5,"Just be warned, this was mintier than I thought it would be. But it's affordable and has a great texture. I have sensitive skin and lips, so it's really gentle. It has a soothing scent.",3
5,"I needed a shaver to keep at work.  On  rare occasions, I ran late and dashed out to catch my commute (forgetting to shave).  The shaver absolutely had to work on A/C power, since I never knew when it would be needed.  The other more expensive shavers used recharged batteries that could be dead or run down on the rare moment when I really needed them.  This shaver seemed to be the answer with its economical price.  I was very surprised at its quiet operation and the smooth shave it gave me.  The only drawback for my needs was the 18 inch coiled cord (two feet long when extended).  That was a little too short.  The problem was addressed with a cheap extension cord from the hardware store.  I hope Norelco keeps offering a shaver that runs on wall current.",3
5,"This brush is great! I bought one from the art of shaving, and after 2 uses, it started to get a smell and it got discolored. This one I've had for 6 months now, and it never got a smell, and it looks just like the day I bought it. It also is very nice on the skin when using it, and is such a great buy.",3
5,"The directions were in Chinese, however the pictures were not(snark!!). I found it quite easy to put together. It holds the wig just fine! Heavy duty it ain't but for that price what does one expect.",3
5,Very happy to have found this since Ulta stopped carrying it.  I especially like the lash serum.  Once the serum is completely dry I use a lash curler and it creates a beautiful curl.  I add a bit of mascara and I nearly look as I did when I was young and had long lush lashes (I am now 56).  Before I found this product my lashes had really thinned out due to aging but since I have been using the serum daily no more &#34;fall out&#34;.  My lashes have really filled back in and look longer!  A great product.  One thing to be careful with is that the brush for the serum is quite sharp!  I've poked my eye twice and it does hurt so apply carefully!,3
5,"I like the fact that the shaver has multiple &#34;blades&#34; and guards.  What I really love about this purchase is the battery life on the shaver.  I've had it for months and have only had to charge it ONCE!!!  Granted, I don't use this every day.  I gather that anyone who did would find that it would last several days before having to recharge.",3
5.0,"I could never find this product in stores except in Virginia on vacation, problem is I live in Chicago.  That's why I purchased online. Leaves lips silky smooth love it!",3
4,I have permed hair and this cap helps a lot with the frizz. I don't like to wash my hair every day because it gets really dry. This cap helps a lot with &#34;day 2 hair&#34;. Keeps it pretty smooth so I don't wake up with that terrible bed head that only another wash could fix. FYI... I'm Mexican with long thick hair. Don't know my hair &#34;type&#34;.,3
5,I LOVE DevaCurl.  Me and my hair are addicted to the products!  I have been using Deva for a little over a year and highly recommend ALL curly girls to make the change to DEVA!  LOVE IT!,3

4,Product feels great on the hands.  Absorbs quickly and is not sticky. Fragrance is soft and will not interfere with regular scent.,3
5.0,Simple modern design.  Product looks and works as described.  My girlfriend and I have been using it practically every night every since it arrived.,3
5,using it twice a month,3
5,"I am a new user, I love this product.  I can feel a difference right away.  I recently went on a 5 day vacation, I decided I would take just the minimum.  I left my Vitamin C serum at home, I could tell that this was a bad decision right away.  I am not sure how a face can be thirsty, but mine sure was by the end of the trip.",3
5,"Feminine, subtle, powdery...the perfume is great too...got it as a gift in Holland in 2003...nice...very nice! Try it for yourself!",3
5,"This is one of the original Cologne waters, a timeless classic, nothing trendy about it. It is a fresh, light combination of fruit and herbals, not cloying or heavy, and appropriate for men and women. This is a warm weather scent (too fresh for winter unless you are in an overheated office or apartment). Great for after a shower on a hot day, before heading back out in the heat, or when you're feeling wilted for whatever reason. It does help clear the mind. I only wish someone would make a longer-lasting version of this... but it's still special while it's there.    Only caution I have is that oil of bergamot is known for causing photosensitivity reactions - so be cautious if out in the sun after using this or 4711.",3
5,I have very dark course hair on my thighs. I use an epilator to shave my legs. When my hair grows back I get a lot of ingrown hairs. The PFB Vanish has almost erased all of them. I do still have a few scars left though. I just started using my second bottle and I will continue to use this product. It really works.,3
5,"I had actually ordered this and received 16 oz of 100% Organic glycerin. I emailed the seller who VERY PROMPTLY told me to keep it for the trouble and immediately sent the correct order. Even expedited the shipping, and I got the Kukui Oil about 2 days later.<br />Best news of all, The kukui nut oil is great on my hair and skin, and Ive decided to make soap with the glycerin and ordered another bottle from this seller. I would absolutely use this seller and both of these products again.",3
4,"I have an allergy to most mascaras. However, just after a few days of using the Pure Fruit mascara my allergy is gone. However, the only downside is that it smudges more than standard brands - but a little powder under the eyes seems to help minimize this.",3
4,"I got two blocks, instead of one black and one brown.",3
5,"This is a great product. It is often more effective than a pumice stone. The scent is pleasing, relaxing; the peppermint gives a tingle to your skin, making the whole process of removing dead skin and calluses​ into a massage.",3
5,"I just used this relaxer for the first time two days ago and joy of joys, I did not get burned.  Additionally, my hair looks and feels shiny and beautiful.  This one's a keeper!",3
5,"This beard trimmer is an awesome product.  I purchased one several years ago, and after extensive use it just wore out.  I think the problem was that the battery outlived it's life cycle and the unit wouldn't charge anymore.  I was really disappointed when I discovered that Remington had discontinued this model.  None of the replacement models looked very good to me, so I was extremely happy to find these reburbished ones on Amazon.  I bought the only two available to be sure I'd have a working trimmer for years to come.  You can pay a lot more money, but you won't find a better, easier to use beard trimmer.",3
5,"LOVE this blush!!!  Soft and creamy, it goes on my skin like butter, but doesn't feel greasy or pasty, and gave my cheeks a fresh, completely natural-looking glow.<br /><br />The small, light case is easy to carry in a purse, and I had no questions getting through airport security with it because it's not a liquid or powder.<br /><br />I've been using L'Oreal's Pink Lift blush, but I like Maybelline's Dream Bouncy blush a bit better, because it takes less product to give good coverage, and the price is better for the amount of product you get.",3
5,"I happen to be very sensitive to overpowering fragrances and often have to use fragrance free versions of most things.  These bath salts definitely have the mint and eucalyptus scents, but they are subtle and relaxing not the usual attack on the senses.

4,This is the second teeth whitening solution I have tried. I feel that its excessive packaging for 7 little strips but regardless it seems to be  great product.<br /><br />I noticed a difference after the first time. These take two hours so its quite a hassle but I think well worth it in the end.<br /><br />My only complaint is that my teeth hurt somewhat bad the time after treatment. It goes away and I guess its normal.,3
5,"I guess this is for the Y-Chromosonal types out there: Guys, if you want that humdrum drive to the mall with your gal to smell like you're on that scooter with Audrey Hepburn in 'Roman Holiday' then THIS is what you'll get your lady.

5,I received this as a gift. It makes for a nice mani! It works best if you dab the first coat and then add other coats as normal.,3
5,"I admit I haven't tried many but working outside often with concrete my hands would get pretty dry and cracked.  I tried a few, but after I tried this it's been the only one I've used.",3
4,This is the best option I have seen thus far! I am tired of those smelly liquides that just burn you're skin... plus how do you get your hands on most of your back...  <br /> <br />This shaver works... It's a little tricky to get used to at first but you can do a pretty good job without even looking in a mirrior. I bet it won't last for more than a year... but it's only 39 bucks most regular shavers cost about 100. <br /> <br />Trust me this is by far the best solution I have seen... Highly recomend! Thanks for inventing!,3

5,"As a child teen I always had a lot of acne., when the acne would heal I was left with horrible black spots on my brown skin.

I use this weekly and often mix it with other ingredients, such as egg yolk, Indian herbs (henna, amla, etc), and temporary hair color to brighten up my hair color. It mixed well with these, where other conditioners start to separate and look lumpy. It also great as a leave-in conditioner.<br /><br />Hair conditioners are one of those things that work differently on different hair types, so I can't guarantee that everyone will get as great results as I do, but it's an affordable option and worth a try!",3
5,Am a skin care specialist and many of my clients tells me they use these and their faces look amazing!! Am happy I brought these will be buying them forever!! If you need a facelift without surgery get these.,3
4,"I just started using this a few weeks ago, and so far I like it.  I can't say that the puffiness is gone completely, but it has seemed to help.  I'm hoping that the longer I use it, the more results I will see.  I would defenitely buy it again.",3
5.0,"Just like what I buy at Ulta, but a little cheaper and far more convenient for me!",3
5,"I have an oily t-zone. I use this before I use exfoliating salycylic cleansing pads. This 1-2 punch approach to nighttime skin care dissolves the dirt and make-up. Sometimes I just use the DHC oil, rinse really well and then use astringent. It works so well!",3
5.0,I use this product with magic eraser sponge in my shower.  We have hard water and a clear shower stall glass door.  With those two products I clean up easily.  I just sorry I have to order it on-line.  Worth every penny to me.,3
5,"Doesn't smell like any other perfume I've known. It smells maybe like mist in the woods - earthy not flowery, a bit musky. I like it and it fits my \\""Anthropology\\"" fashion style, low-key, down to earth personality. I also gifted a bottle to my daughter.",3
5,I like this fragance,3
5,Everything you want in a shaver this one gives you!  A close shave and a wonderful cleaning system.  This is the best electric shaver I have had.  I have had Remington and Braun shavers but this beats both of them.  It is very quiet while giving you a close shave.,3
5,My hair fell out on top and I got this to hide it. Matched my haircolor perfect! I love it!,3
5,"Ouch! This one is  a little more painful but not so much that I won't continue to use it. It produces a bit more blood but I think it works better than the ones with the needles in single rows. These needles are scattered out and are sharper, it does have a spot that grabs as it rolls but only after many uses and rinsing with alcohol. A little oil or lotion on each side of the wheel fixes it for a session. No pain, no gain right?! Will order another when this one wears out!",3
5,"Soooo happy that I can order this online, can't fine it in stores anymore.  How can a company get rid of a classic, and for a the price, got it at 22.00 dollars plus tax  NEW! Will order again.",3
5,constant speed and provides great leverage to reach tough places in the mouth. Good for massaging gums as well. This is after using it for a month. No complains!,3
4,"I am a doctor of Physical Therapy; I deal with ultrasound machines every day. I have tried this machine on myself first before I try it on my patients. I have found out the following:    1- The machine has 3 Probes, each one of them has different function (one for body parts, one for the face and the smallest for the eye area!)  2- The machine has two kinds of waves that can be used with different body parts, which is a plus to this machine.  3- The machine has different frequencies which is very essential for different treatment protocols.  4- The intensity is not that great, and this is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5.  5- It comes built in sturdy box with place to the three probes which will protect the machine and the probes as well.    I highly recommend that you ask your  Physical Therapist on how to use this machine and what are the different methods of application before you try it on yourself or before you start treating anyone.(Only if you are not a Physical Therapist). Wrong application may lead to deep burn and unpleasant complications!",3
5,"I have tried several brow taming products, I even went as far as using my hair gel on an old toothbrush!!  This product was heaven sent!  Not too sticky, but just enough to have my brows stay in place all day.  Great product!",3
5,"Really enjoy both of these. I am used to wearing high end, expensive perfumes and love the price of this one.  I get compliments on it as much as my $160 bottles of perfume.",3
4,I love this perfume.  Loved the travel size for my purse but wished it was a spray.,3
5,I love this product and I'm ordering more today. It is an excellent natural sunscreen for my face that contains safe non-toxic ingredients. I have sensitive skin and it did not irritate it. It is slightly white but spreads very easily and is a light texture. I just put a little bronzer over it if I feel pale after applying it. Love the 50 spf and it's balanced for both UVA and UVB protection.,3
4,Cute Container!,3
5,"I absolutely love this cream. I've always had dry skin and have searched for years for a great cream to use at night. I live in a fairly dry climate and that doesn't help matters! I've been using all Murad products for about two years and been experimenting with the different lines. I like this cream so much I use it in the morning under my make up too! It is so hydrating, smooth and makes my skin look \\""dewey\\"", hydrated. I love it and it lasts about a month even using it both day and night.",3
5,"I love Out the Door Northern Lights topcoat! Along with an effective protective topcoat the shine is amazing! This was the first time Ive bought the gold, in the past Ive bought the silver but this color is amazing! Highly recommended!",3
5,"Got this for my mother in law, who is a breast cancer survivor. She says it really works! Keeps her keys in a handy spot. Easy to find.",3
5,This product works great. It dries my hair extremely fast and does not leave it frizzy-that's a plus to someone with curly hair!,3
5,"On time, as ordered.  Good quality tea tree, good price. What else can I say.What else can I say.What else can I say.",3
5,I bought this to add to my homemade facial moisturizer and so far I'm pleased with it.  This homemade skin care is new to me but so far the sunblock is working and I haven't broken out from it.  The product arrived quickly and well packaged.,3
5,They perform really well. I love the feel of them and the way they are able to apply makeup. Good investment.,3
5,great,3
5,I love this headband! I've worn it a couple times and haven't had any issues with it breaking. It's a great price and looks just like what you would buy in the stores!,3
4,"Changed formula!  This conditioner no longer has the same perfumed scent that it had before.  It's still scented, but the scent is different, and I prefer the old.",3
5,"I get so many compliments on my hair color since I started using this! It turns my medium/mousy brown hair into a rich and stunning shade of purple. I need two boxes to do my head, medium thickness/medium length, so I'd recommend doubling up if your hair is past your shoulders.",3
5,"Omega makes excellent shaving brushes, and this one is no exception.  It is not as stiff as a bristle brush, but not as soft as a badger brush.  It is, if you will, a happy medium.  A little water goes a long way, with a little soap, for a good lather built up on your face.  It rinses clean, and shakes almost dry. The handle is a deep, vibrant blue. The Shaving Shop packaged it expertly, and shipped it quickly...I was impressed (a loyal customer is born).",3
5,"I love the elegance of this handbag holder. I purchased one in another color to give as a gift, because I felt like this was a great purchase and gift idea.",3
5,"I used to be a big fan of Victoria Secret's line of perfumes but found they were not long lasting like \\""Intimately Beckham for her\\"". Thank you Beckham's and all involved for making such a great smelling and long lasting scent perfume that suits me just right! Now, can you all just come up with affordable make-up?!",3
4.0,"I found that this product to worked well on my nails. I didn't notice any changes in my skin or hair, but my nails grew a lot and are somewhat stronger. The only downsides of this product are the size of the pills and the smell, they have a funky odor to them. The pills are very large, I didn't have a problem taking them, but others might, which is how I ended up with them (they were too big for my mom to take). I'd buy them again since they worked for my nails, that was the main reason that I decided to give them a try.",3
5,"First trimmer I've ever purchased and am completely satisfied so far.  Digital readout with charge indicator and closeness setting, corresponding inches on the side. Trims with no feeling or pulling - you don't even realize it's cutting. Vacuum catches a lot of hair, though not all. Easy to hold and use.",3
5,Have been using this eyeshadow for years...But....It was discontinued in all stores...<br />Was soooo Happy to find it here!~ I wear it over a light brown...PERFECT!,3
5,"I use it everyday, it doesn't cake or make my face feel grimy. Love it!",3
5,Cuts hair with ease. Surprised at how well it will cut considering how much lighter it is than my last set of clippers.,3
5,Verry good,3
5,"my new hair stylist recommended that I get this and I'm super glad I did. I have long, wavy, and frizzy hair normally, but after drying my hair and putting some of this fabulous stuff in it, it looked amazing! its light weight and it actually conditions your hair as well as keep it held through the day. really great product!",3
5,"My grandson was visiting recently, he has such bad eczema, I was desperate!! I had this soap for awhile, and thought<br />it couldn't hurt to try. I'm so glad I did, he wasn't scratching/itching or crying( he's 18 months). I was DESPERATE, to<br />get him some relief, I can't say enough GOOD things about this soap. Except left no residue, no itching afterwards and<br />the biggest reward: he slept through the night! God bless your soap! I will DEFINITELY be reordering!",3
4,Great fragrance but the scent doesn't last,3
5,"Sucks getting old and hairy especially where you don't want or need extra hair.  This trimmer is great for nose hairs.  It cuts really well without grabbing and pulling.  Very powerful, comfortable and cleans up in a snap.  Highly recommend.",3
5,"This is the best facial product, it will remove removes layers of dry skin",3
5,"Perfect for nose and ear trimming.  It is absolutely non irritating, and unlike others I've used, can be washed under running water after each use.",3
5.0,This works really well.,3
5,I love this brush and would recommend it to anyone!,3
4,A friend recommended I try this toothbrush out and I have to say it is unlike any brushing experience I have ever had.  It truly is a massage for your mouth.  It's the softest toothbush ever and my gums feel so good after being brushed.,3
5,"The electric tooth brush works great and these replacement toothbrushes, are easy to take out and put back in.  My teeth and gums get nice and clean.  Not a bad price, for buying 4 at a time.",3
4,"I like how it feels when it goes on.  A lot of creams aren't absorbed but this one seems to be and doesn't just sit on the surface of my skin.<br />I have a lot of puffiness under the eyes that is mainly do to a bad thyroid.  Because of the intermittent swelling, it has caused wrinkles in that area, which I just hate.  I was hoping this might help those but if it did, it was minimal.  I have used the product for a month and the tiny jar is half gone.  I use it every day.  When I stop using it, that is when I might notice it was actually working.  Will report back after that.",3
5,Everything is as I expected.,3
5,Great product.,3
5,I am a licensed cosmetologist and i recommend this product to anyone who uses heat on their hair! it will help keep your hair undamaged and protect it from heat. it smells great it gives your hair a nice shine not greasy.,3
5,These little suckers seem to be hard to find in the stores in the last few years the new ones they are selling now are more tall instead  vertically long like these....glad I found them here!!!!!!!!!,3
4,"kinda tiny instrument  maybe there all ths size check if u want bigger. would be good for face but I also wanted for legs , but I will use for legs also not ready to attemptfor face yet",3
5,"I purchased this to replace the numerous disposable razors that i have bought and accumulated that have worn out after 1 or 2 shaves. I was tired of throwing things away and the feel of the disposable was always an issue, sometimes having to press down on my face to get a close shave.<br />My first shave with this razor produced the best shave I have had in a long time. although the handle is a bit short, I feel it compliments the heavy head well, allowing the razor to sit naturally on my face. Excellent product, and well worth the money.",3
5,This lotion smells amazing! The tingle effects deliver perfect coverage with the perfect amount of bronzing power. Absolutely love this lotion.,3
5,"I am very pleased with this product!  Must skin feels sooo smooth and clean!!  I,m so glad I found it!  a real boost to exfoliation!!!  Thanks!!",3
5,"I have baby-fine hair, shoulder-length, colored (although not frequently). My hair tended to break off and just...not be the hair I wanted. It was not shiny, not strong, lifeless and damaged. Like others on here, I finally bit the bullet and bought the Wen trial kit at Sephora. After that was used up, I bought the pumpkin. I have to say, it's really good - my hair is shiny, strong - and suddenly, it's growing! (Probably just not breaking off constantly.) I can take a thick handful of hair now - really nice. And the gloss on it! Wow! I tell my kids I'm actually having to get used to my hair looking this good - it even looks better in photos. It feels \\""fat\\"" and bouncy. It smells great. I've been using Wen for about 7-8 weeks so far, and I'm very pleased. It might not be for everyone, but it's worth trying for a month and see what you think. I didn't see improvement immediately - give it a couple of weeks.",3
5,"The formula of all the ELF Mineral lipsticks is very moisturizing and comfortable to wear - they literally feel like lip balm on the lips. I don't have problems with them bleeding. This color is very pretty and one of the most daring of the whole collection, without being over the top (it's a great pink for the summer). Also, with just one swipe it gives a natural look which is easily buildable. I like that it does not look trashy. I have several shades that I purchased for $5 on the ELF website. I definitely recommend any of the mineral lipsticks!",3
5,I bought this only to use for special occasions but I liked it so much I find myself using it everyday after my gym workout. It is subtle and lasts almost the entire day.,3
5,Well packaged. Thanks for taking care with shipping!<br />Bought this with the duck handle umbrella to help build back an umbrella collection lost during a move. Both are solidly made & are just as described.<br />Very handsome: would also make a great gift for any nature lover.,3
5,I bought this body spray and the lotion in Hollister last weekend it was in a different bottle though it's the same thing and I love it! It has a really fruity beach smell it's the perfect scent for going to work or going on a date.,3
5,"Very beautiful and stylish.  Whether you are going for a retro or renaissance look, this pair of Bobbie pins will work for you.  They hold and stay in my hair all day.love them.",3
5,I love this product.It hydrates so well. Not greasy and does don't make me break out. My skin feels and looks great since using. I'm on my second bottle and will continue to use.,3
5,Absolutely fantastic. I use this for breast feeding and dry hands. Smells a little strong but not unbearable. Would definitely recommend.,3
5,This oil smells very nice. I used it in a bath with epsom salt. Also have put a few drops onto a cotton ball and onto my nightstand. Shipping was very fast and well packed.,3
5,great! i am very pleased with this!,3
5,"I use this as a shampoo / body wash and I LOVE it.<br />Knowing the all natural ingredients and it does have a nice natural foam effect.<br /><br />I plan to buy Dr. Bronner's from here on and out. Planning on buying more of their nice and natural products, plus organic!",3
5,"Great for defrizzing, because it hardens a bit to keep the frizzies in, and the color is subtle enough that it doesn't look unnatural.",3
5,Very good product. My face stays hydrated and soft all day.,3
5,Works great!,3
5,"I purchased the ReSami Miracle Hair Replenishing Complex in the PINK capsules from HSN a year or two ago.  This is a hair oil product that you use SPARINGLY so that you don't end up with an oily-looking head of hair.  You notice I said I purchased it a year or two ago from HSN in the pink capsules, and I am NOW just looking to replenish my supply.  I used the last capsule this morning on my hair, and I figured I needed to get a refill.  HSN no longer offers this product, so I did a Web search.  My ReSami (PINK capsule) screw-top container has the name \\""Advanced Health Laboratories, LLC, Woodridge, IL 60517, Made in Italy\\"" printed on the top of the container.  I found a ReSami product at their website in a \\""pump\\"" applicator.  I'd like to have the capsules, so I've been searching around for the capsules, and can't locate them.<br /><br />The product that I have been using is excellent to use when you feel your hair becoming dry from the elements, processing or just over washing.  There are many products out on the market that have glycol in them, and those products, I have found, build up in my hair, so I try not to purchase those products.  I think you will like the ReSamla or ReSami product.",3
5,Exactly what I ordered. Looks great on my new tattoo. Very dark but should lighten when it heals. I highly recommend.,3
5,"This is a very good brand of gel. I recently bought this whole line, my clients are very happy with the outcome of their nails!",3
5,"I love this jar. It has rubber on the bottom so it won't slip off the counter.  How does an average person, who doesn't work in a salon, clean their combs and bushes?  I have friends who put them in the dishwasher, yuck!  I just couldn't do it.  One thing to note if you have a wide, 3&#34; brush it won't fit in the jar with the metal holder and top.  I remove the metal piece and put the brush in for 10 minutes. I close the bathroom door so my cats can't go in there.  Then pull the brush out and rinse with hot water and you are good to go.",3
5,Keeps my face clear of acne. Feels good on my skin.  Also use it on my arms.<br />I like the way it smells.,3
5,"What can I say except they are combs! Good combs. Not those brittle, thin combs that break at the site of a good head of challenging hair! I must say, we all want more use from the products we pay for and this is one of those products.",3
5,Love it,3
5,Works exactly as I expected.,3
5,This curling iron is fantastic. Once you unroll the curl it just stays and the hair looks shiny and healthy. I think the ceramic barrel is how this is accomplished. The hair does not look burned by excessive heat that you get with the others that are not ceramic.,3
5.0,Best electric toothbrush ever had,3
5,Fantastic tool to use for nail designs with different sizes to use. Let the creativity begin!!  Fun way to pass the time.,3
4,Love Cerrruti 1881 will order again. Thanx,3
5,I am very satisfied with this product and use it every evening. I have seen a noticeable difference in both eyelash length and thickness. I have been using RapidLash for about 6 months and replace it about every 3 months. Am glad I tried it initially.,3
5,I love it and any guy that tries it will feel the same. Huge amount of lather it makes. Keeps a barrier between razor blade and skin and a nice masculine smell.,3
5,"My Chi iron broke and I got this one to replace it. I had the Chi for a number of years but it was a top rated product when purchased and it held up wonderfully. This iron, which was soooo much cheaper is just as good and soooo much more affordable! I liked it so much that I got this one from this seller as a CHristmas present for my friend who has naturally curly hair (Mines is thick and frizzy). The seller ships super fast and the product came in perfect condition. You can't go wrong at this price!",3
5,I use this to make my homemade lash extension formula.  It works as well as any mascara tube.  Doesn't leak.  My clear formula remains clear in the tube and when I apply.,3
5,"This product is quickly turning into one of my favorites! Now face washing doesn't seem like a chore anymore. The smell is invigorating, compared to the medicinal smell of most purifying cleansers. Gentle enough to use everyday yet strong enough to cleanse my skin of all impurities. Can't wait to purchase more products!!",3
5,"For years I'd been using Crest ProHealth toothpaste. My teeth always had these weird stains on them and my mouth never felt really &#34;clean&#34; after brushing.<br /><br />I ran out of Crest and came to Amazon to buy some more. I noticed a few negative reviews and checked them out. There were a lot of people saying the Crest ProHealth and other toothpastes with whatever chemicals are in them were staining their teeth and they had switched to various types of different, natural toothpastes. This brand was one that a few people had switched to.<br /><br />I picked up this 3-pack and couldn't be happier. From the first time you brush your teeth with it, you notice a difference. Your mouth has a &#34;clean&#34; feeling that can only be described as &#34;right out of the dentist's chair.&#34;<br /><br />It has a nice flavor, a bit of baking soda bitterness with mint oil. Best of all, it doesn't stain my teeth like the chemical toothpastes do.<br /><br />I bought a 3-pack and 2 of them are already gone, given to friends and family to try out. I'll be purchasing more here in the near future.",3
5,"Izzy Wizzy has been a fantastic addition to my growing gel collection! Due to the fine pink & blue iridescent particles, when Izzy is used over pinks, blues & purples it picks up the tones of the color beneath, causing my nails to take on a chameleon like effect, thus making color matching with clothing & accessories a much easier task. My friend recently used it over All Dahlia-ed Up & found her nails were suddenly a close match to all of the bright pinks in her wardrobe! It lends a subtle pop to French tips & gives other colors a holographic type of shimmer. Unlike other sparkly toppers, such as Water Field, Grand Jewels, or Twinkle, Izzy does slightly change the color beneath, but I found the change pleasing & stylish. This is my second bottle of Izzy & certainly not my last!",3
5,This is a great product my wife truly loves to use to moisturize fry skin.  She finds it applies easier and cleaner than any  lotions or cremes.,3
4,I'm not sure about the 'age rewind' part - I'm only in my twenties and take pretty good care of my skin - but this foundation is one of the best I've ever used (and I've tried a lot!). The coverage is perfect and you can even double it up as a concealer. It doesn't budge when you top it off with translucent powder. High recommended!,3
5,Very good product. Goes on well. Just need to follow the instructions for perfect coverage.,3
5.0,"No need to go for highend gel eyeliner, this last all day long, even in the water line. AMAZING!",3
5,Love It!!!,3
5,Moisturizing for sure. Haven't used it long enough to see any other results,3
5,I have used this hairspray the past 5 years. Only a little spray hold my hair. Its not messy nor sticky. One bottle lasts over one month.,3
4,"As much as I love this product and how it smells and softens my hair, I have just realized that TBHQ is in it, which is considered to be a carcinogen. Does anyone have any idea about how safe this product is if being used each day?",3
5.0,"Phone is very pretty.  Color in picture is accurate.  Screen is bright and S pen is responsive.  It came with almost a full charge, but in a different language.  It also came with wall charger and sync/charge cable.  The wall charger we rec'd will not fit U.S. sockets.  Luckily we had an extra USB wall charger.  Other than that, its been no problem.<br />  To change the default language to English, touch the bottom right corner with a bunch of squares- that's your apps icon.  Then choose the 'gear' (settings).  Then go to the second icon at the top.  It's shaped like a bunch of lines like an equalizer.  This is your 'controls' icon.

5,"Archipelago was my very first experience with reed diffussers.  Since then I purchased several different brands as my supplier ran out of Archipelago.  Also, I wanted to experiment.  I always return to Archipelago and will not bother with further experiments.    Archipelago's fragrance is subtle yet strong enough to waft through my house. The fragrence is a wonderful 'surprise' when I come home from shopping.  Archipelago is also long lasting.  My favorite scent is Pomegranate Citrus.",3

5,Great sheer summer orange lips!  Super fun great summer orange color.  Leaves lips moist and colorful.  Love Baby Lips products,3
5,"I am particular about fragrance and don't enjoy many of the heavy perfumes.  This is just the right amount and so very lovely!  I have yet to find one D&G that isn't lovely, however, 18 La Lune is so refreshing and quite a nice change from the everyday perfumes.  I hope they continue to make this for a long time.  I found mine at Ulta for about this same price or less.",3
5,This Shaver works very well. I have used another brand of electric shaver for years. The Braun 790cc is far superior to my previous shaver. The shave is very close and comfortable. The cleaning station works well to keep it clean & fresh. I do recommend the Braun 790cc to anyone who uses a electric shaver.,3
5,"[[VIDEOID:be63f40204e5cb1dbb4bb46da491f052]]Shea butter comes in a color from deep yellow to white. The smell is distinct. This actually smells like every shea butter that I have come across before. It is what you would consider \\""raw\\"" and \\""pure.\\"" This means there are no unnecessary additives in this product.

5.0,good,3
5,"This leave-in conditioner is amazing, it moistens and keeps the hair moist. I use it weekly and I have no complaints. It also have an amazing scent, a fresh-clean scent.",3
5,"Usually I ignore reviews, especially on Amazon, where many products I've bought that people raved about have been ho-hum at best. In any case, this stuff actually made a difference. I have really, really fine hair. I don't style it or anything, but in a week or two this started making my hair feel much more substantial. My hair no longer feels so limp. I think it looks quite a bit better, too. I had used herbal essences for years simply because I was lazy before I finally decided to try a different shampoo. There is no way I could ever go back.",3
5,Anyone into essential oils will need this for thier collection.  I have been amazed at all the little wonders. Thanks,3
5,"I've bought quite a bit of shea butter in the past, since I prefer it to the chemicals in hand lotion.  This is by far the best I've bought.  It doesn't contain any of the hard, pebble-sized chunks you sometimes have to break down in raw shea butter.  It is very smooth, and melts in the hand almost instantly, making it easy to apply to the skin... just as easily as hand lotion actually.  Good product at a good price!  Thanks.",3
5.0,Love this product. And will definatly order it again.,3
5,"I gave it 5 stars because it does what I purchased it to do and it's cute. I use this to mix and apply my bentonite clay/activated charcoal face mask. The brush is a bit too small for me to use anywhere else on my body, but I like that it's soft and small enough to store out of the way. The measurements are in Chinese I suppose, but for my uses I only need to get the proportions right so it's fine. Would buy again.",3
5,I am very satisfied with this product. It keeps hair the same way it is explained &#34;extra strong hold. Good quality.,3
5.0,Easy on the skin.,3
4,"A nice classic design on a large, soft scarf. I really like it! I might order several of these scarves for Christmas or birthday presents. There is a design for every lady I know.",3
5,My white hair tends to get yellowish and this product takes the yellow away.<br />My hair stylist recommended it. Love it.,3
5,"I am so glad that the Body Shop has kept this product around as long as they have. It is one of my favorite smells ever, very clean and refreshing!",3
5,At first I was looking for cheap cheap then I realized that this actually is a good deal item.  It has everything. I am literally  going to Boston overnight on a business trip and this has everything I need.  The only thing.... I wish it had a shave gel or cream instead of hairspray only because  the razor is cheesy and you need something good to lube the legs and I don't use hairspray. IMHO.,3

5,"I had used Fixodent Cleanser Tablets since '95 but suddenly about 1 1/2 yrs. ago, I could not find these tablets anywhere and was forced to use another brand.  Neither my husband nor me could get our dentures odor free or clean with any of the others.  Please keep a large inventory on hand since I have found it impossible to find these elsewhere.  They were received on a timely basis and in good condition.",3
5,One of my favorites!,3
5,I finally found the one.  This shaver is the best one I've ever had.  Definitely worth the price and more.,3
5,"I haven't had nearly as many zits since my girlfriend made me start using this.  Also, I had a brown mole that is now bleached to the same color as the rest of my face.  Kinda weird, but I'm happy with it.",3
5,This stuff could double as perfume... I mean... If you're into that.<br /><br />Wanted a more natural sunscreen and purchased this (as well as a couple others to compare).  This one shoots a nice fine mist and just smells amazing.  My husband and I put it on before going out for a day on the boat and it stood the test of time.  I didn't have to reapply and was never burned.  Note - I was wearing a hat and didn't ever fully submerge in water.<br /><br />All in all I love this product and will definitely purchase it again.,3
5,"use them twice and toss them away, cheap but not good for more than 2 uses. I recall when these first came out;",3
5,I wish I discovered TimeBalm products sooner. This set is an absolute necessity for those with combo or dry skin.<br /><br />The cleanser is rose-scented and very gentle. All you need is one pump and the bottle lasts a very long time. The creams are also pleasantly scented and are very moisturizing without being heavy or giving your face that oily look.<br /><br />I'm thrilled with this purchase. Would make a great gift as it comes in such a cute box.,3
5.0,Was nice. went sally hair supplies the other day. they cost a lot more not as nice as this one. So I got a great deal.,3
5.0,"I lost all of my hair after chemo and when it began to grow back, instead of my usual dirty blonde it came back white.<br />As it got longer I noticed it took on a yellowish tinge that I didn't care for, so I was debating whether or not to just color it a medium blonde shade.<br />I found this shampoo and decided to heck with it, I'm going to embrace my new gray hair and become a silver fox.<br />After just one use it got rid of all the yellow and my hair is a soft and shiny platinum. I like the new me very much.",3
5,"The only thing I DON'T use this for is to wash my face as it definitely stings my eyes. It has replaced my shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and shaving cream. And it lasts forever. Haven't tried out the travel bag yet, will keep you posted.",3
5,"After using this system for a week or two, there was noticeably less hair in my brush.  Interesting, but nice, smell.",3
4,nill,3
5,Smells really good. I keep it in the bathroom.,3
5,"I never realized that paying a little more for tweezers and nail clippers would make so much difference.  I used to fight with the cheaper ones to get the job done, but these clippers are so sharp and precise.  I will definitely buy them again.  They also would make nice stocking stuffers for the holidays next year.",3
5,"Don't spend your money on expensive body exfoliators, this will do the job just as well. I use this product weekly!",3
5,"this product is awesome, i was skeptical about it, but my hair felt thicker after a few washes. And it also made my hair feel soft and look shiny!",3
5,thank u,3
5,Great tool. I have discovered that using this now and then keeps the tarter off and thus my dental cleanings are quick and painless.,3
5.0,Thick pretty piece. I have darker brown hair (a level 6) with blonde streaks and this blends beautifully,3
4.0,"These are great makeup brushes for the price. You just have make sure you wash them first before you use them(you should with all brushes), You also may have to wash them more then once there was a slight smell with mine but nothing  like what other people were saying in there reviews. Other then that they were fine. It was very little shading I mean very little.  After I wash the brushes the smell went away. Before I used them I noticed that they were really soft with sturdy handles. The design of the brushes reminded me of tarte makeup brushes. Some of the brushes are sorter then standered makeup brushes making the good for travel and fit easily into a makeup bag. I haven't had a chance to use them that much. Just 2 eye brushes and those picked up product well. I'm going to try out the whole set for the next 2 weeks and do the multiple washing test to see how the hold up. I will do a full review on my blog skynynailartandbeauty.com and then up date my review post here with more info. But over all this would be a great set or someone just starting out with makeup or trying to add some brushes to their collection that won't break the bank.",3
5,"Previously, I was getting my hair colored at an Aveda salon a beautiful plum shade. I stopped because I do not enjoy salon visits. I was letting my roots grow out a few inches when I had the idea to try Naturtint. I have no greys. My natural color is a level six dark blond and my previously dyed hair was plum wine. I used the Lt. Mahagony over the combo and it worked beautifully. The roots were fully covered and the hair was an unusual, pretty tint. This color does fade but that's what I like about it. It's a bit much for me the first week. Then the color settles in. It blended my natural hair with the faded plum well. There was a color difference but it didn't matter. The product has a faint, pleasant fragrance from the colorant and no sensations on the scalp while the dye sits for the alloted time. My hair felt soft afterwards and was not broken like at the salon. Naturtint Lt. Mahagony does stain so be careful to wipe drips that fall in the bathroom or where ever your color station is. Definitely pull up all rugs and hide nice towels. Wear an old shirt. I found the dye does not stain the skin as it fades very quickly at the hairline after washing but I wipe the hairline border carefully just in case. My only two wishes would be more Naturtint colors to choose from and that this didn't cost so much but but a box of Naturtint is a better buy than a salon visit!",3
4,Does not provide as much body as I thought it would but I am sure others may find the product beneficial.,3
5,These are awesome! Not too rough on your nails but just enough to smooth your nails out. I use them after i remove gel polish to take any excess stuff off. They work like a charm and leave my nails nice and smooth.,3
5,I love silver and I used this color for nail art.  Soon I'm getting nail art tools and I'll be using this color even more.,3
5,"This extended body cleaner is working well. It is not really a brush. It is a Pouf on a stick. It accepts shower gel and holds long term suds. I use it not only for my back, but also for my lower legs and feet. A minor complaint is that the Pouf is slightly stiffer than the stand alone Pouf, but within acceptable usage condition.",3
5,Uniwigs is  wonderful to do business with. They make sure you are completely satisfied.,3
5,This bonding agent works great under my Shellac manicure.  I have had no trouble with peeling or cracking.  The manicure last 2 weeks or more as promised.  Worth the money!,3
4,It's nice to finally have a product for face by Australian Gold.  It's been my favorite lotion for years but I could never find anything for my face.  This is great.,3
4,"thought it would be a little darker when i apply it just light and shiny..but!..for the price..go for it,i like to blend make up and most of the time blend really nice thats why i gave 4 stars for this...",3
5,"It was a gift.  It's a nice subtle scent, and the price was (relatively) good for this size.  Hopefully it lasts a while...",3
5,"To anyone woman or long-haired man who doesn't own this contraption, they are missing out!  I have long curly hair, and Technique makes the best brush products for long/difficult manes.  I recently bought this replacement brush, since my old Technique had to be put down... after 6 YEARS!  Great product.",3
5,Great product for a good price with speedy delivery. Thank you!,3
5,I really like this nail polish,3
5,"Works very well for a longer beard.  Mine has grown out enough that beard oil doesn't tame it any longer, but this leaves my beard soft and civilized looking.  Scent is very mild and goes away quickly.  Price is on par with other beard balms.  Given how simple and cheap it is to make your own, I will probably be going that route for future beard balm needs.",3
4,"I usually get this from a well known retail store, bu they don't seem to carry it any morre. Product arrived in a box that did not belong to it, individual tube boxes had obviously been opened before since they were torn and stuck together with tape, but the tube iteslf was intact and never opened, so, all in all, good.",3
5,"Very nice cologne! Nowhere near as strong as I imagined and lasts quite a white. The wife loves it, too!<br />Many thanks!!!",3
5,I really like this product because when I put it on in the morning it still looks fresh at the end of my day<br />The price was the best I could find online and it was a lot less than I have been paying in my local store<br /><br />The applicator is kept in the bottom of the container so it doesn't get lost<br /><br />One problem I have is that I run out of the gold eyelid color way before running out of the dark line shade. It makes me think that the packaging is designed by someone who does not use it. It would be so much better if the gold eyelid color was 3/4 of the contents and the dark line color was only 1/4 of the package. Then Both colors would empty at the same time,3
5,nice color,3
5.0,"I used this item mostly for my upper lip and chin...it was amazing. It was a bit tricky to use,but I feel that one must work with this item to get good results. Its less painful than threading which is almost the same thing. I read a lot of reviews that say that they had to go over an area multiple times and i don't find that to be a problem. The lady that threads my upper lip DOES THE SAME thing! the pain was not a real issue. I hope to continue using this item for the rest of my hair growing life!",3
5,"This was among the toiletries in the bathroom of our room at the Paris Westin Vendome and I immediately fell in love with it!  The fragrance is intoxicating and totally habit forming. I was delighted to find that I could order it online since I had almost used up my souvenir bottles from the hotel. Every time I put it on my hands, etc. it instantly takes me back to Paris -- a trip I shall never forget.  Yes, it was that fabulous!",3
5,"A woman told me that I never seen in my life told me that there us nothing sexier than a man that smells good this is one of the colon' s that have them wanting to sit next to you,I just love this,I recommend this product.",3
5,primarily ordered to keep my straps on my shoulders.  Works well.,3
5,"This is really a jazzy walker...so colorful, and it seems to be a little wider than the one my mother used.  The only problem is that colored wheel attachments aren't available for this walker.  Other than that, it's certainly a step up from the plain old silver aluminum walkers that most people use.  Add a walker \\""basket\\"", and you're all set to go.",3
5,"I have tried several lotions for keeping my skin look healthy especially  in the winter.  This by far is the BEST I have found.<br />I like it is free of dyes, fragrance free, and free of toxins.  I love that it is non-greasy.",3
5,"Excellent product, pricey but worth the money.  My mom wears it and now I smell like my MOM all day which I love.  I do not like perfume because I feel sticky all day and greasy.  Powder with scent is the way to go!!",3
5,"I have tried many powders and like this one best. I have mild rosacea, and find that this powder gives my skin a nice finish<br />without making my skin look like a mask. It doesn't give full coverage but it definitely gives medium coverage. I am fair in complexion but find that the medium works best for me, the light is too light. I use it over my foundation, or just a quick swipe over my sunscreen.",3
4,"I have to come back and re write review. after taking 3 bottles, no progress and was full refunded from the manuf website.  if youre shiny bald and want to regrow hair, goggle these big 3 three and see your doctor: minoxidil + finasteride + Nizoral.",3
5,"I really don't remember purchasing this, but I'm sure it was worth the purpose, for I don't have it any more, so I must have used it all,  I'm 81 and I don't look it, so my doctor says.  She says I look at least ten years younger than my age.  So it must have worked",3
5,good smell,3
5,"I got a bottle of this as I was desparate to find something that could keep my nose from burning when I am out on the water for long periods boating/jetskiing. I just used this product for 9 days straight with several hours (up to 10 hrs) each day in direct sun. My nose did not burn! Unfortunately, it is not legal to sell in the United States. I hope to find a means to buy it on-line. The only issue I have with this product it that if used on legs or parts that come in contact with the jetski seat, it will cause the vinyl seat to fade in color at the point of contact.  So now I just use it for my face or parts that are very susceptible to burning. GREAT STUFF!",3
5,TOTALLY SATISIFIED.,3
5.0,Works! Love it! Worth the $$,3
5.0,"Got these clippers a few years ago but never wrote a review. Well, they are great clippers, my husband has given my son numerous fades and buzz cuts with these clippers, always looked good. Make sure you buy the Wahl oil too. Priced lower than stores. Very good quality!",3
5,Really love this lash conditioner. It makes mascara easier to apply. Well worth the money and some. Will order this product again.,3
5,I love this product. My skin is super super soft it smells great.,3
5,"I rely on these reviews but often times forget to write them. A year after buying this blow dryer, I am still a happy customer. This blow dryer is durable and quiet. Even after almost daily use, it works just as great as it did the first day. This is by far the quietest blow dryer I've ever used. I often forget how loud they can be. I'm reminded when I have used my mom's or when I get my hair cut at the salon. Definitely worth the money.",3
5,I just love this product.This product has done wonders for me.It has cleared my acne.Because it doesn't clog my pore like regular make up.And I have very dark under eye skin tone due sinus problems and iron deficiency.And it hides the dark skin and makes my eyes look normal and not look tired.I highly recommend this product.,3
5,"I use fractionated coconut oil in 10ml roller ball bottles to which I have added 2 - 4 drops of essential oils for the proper dilution rates. The roller ball is very convenient to store and apply the diluted oils. Fractionated coconut oil is the BEST carrier oil I've used so far, it flows very smoothly through the roller ball and doesn't leave my skin feeling &#34;oily&#34; afterwards.<br /><br />Tip - an easy to use recipe is 2 - 4 drops of lemon essential oil, fill the remainder of the 10ml roller ball with fractionated coconut oil.  Shake and use as a blemish oil.  The lemon essential oil is very healing and helps to cut down on the bacteria that causes blemishes. It's perfect for us in middle age with a mix of dry and oil skin with a few blemishes.",3
5,This is a great product. A little goes a long way and I have very thick hair. The styling mud holds all day and is light so it does not weigh my hair down by the end of the day. Great product from a great company. Glad I discovered it.,3
5,"Product holds my locs up & in place like the picture, while being light weight & not to tight on my head.",3
5,"Works great, I never expected such great results so fast. My brows now look perfect and it only took about five minutes total. I will buy again. Also, I used half a capsule and the wood applicator and got amazing results.",3
5,husband request. shipping is from europe but came fairly quick. the product works on oily hair very well,3
4,"I have sensitive skin, and it kind of burns around my lips and eyes. But it's better than most sunblock.",3
5,"Really nice quality, very creamy and easy to blend. One the to note, it doesn't go very far. But for the price, I'm very happy.",3
5.0,"These are the best. I depot my MAC shadows and blushes. These hold so many ,they are always sturdy. They come in many colors now.",3
5,I was given a sample of this mascara at Sephora and I absolutely loved it.  I bought a full-sized one right away and it is my favorite mascara.  It makes them longer and doesn't clump or smear.,3
5,"Great product, I added conditioner to mines for a brighter blue and it looked great! I paired it with purple hair color for a mermaid ombré effect",3
5.0,I have very sensitive skin and this moisturizer makes a huge difference in the tone and texture of my skin. It improves the overall appearance of my blemishes and gives me that dewy look without heavy oils or harsh ingredients.<br />Also smells wonderful!,3
5,"Good quality. I use it to trim my beard every few days. I oil it at every use. We also use it for family haircuts. Good, sturdy construction. Valuable for any family.",3
5,Tried it based on reviews and limited knowledge of some of the oils in this blend. I was slightly hesitant but turned out to be pleasantly surprised.  The orange balances out the Patchouli which can be strong and it really has a nice relaxing / herbal smell. I like it and found myself breathing deeply - (heavy sigh - smile).<br />Enjoy - try it!,3
5,You have to try it!,3
5,I love this product. The Hawaiian Tropic Tanning crème lotion spray is the best! Absorbs very well and does not feel oily.,3
5,"I tend to be somewhat lazy, when it comes to my hair but whenever I decide to really make an effort, this brush makes my life much more simple. Great for static and those little flyaways. It seems to manage my static issue and help with curl!",3
4,"My only user complaint about this product is that if you use it in the morning, you will notice a bit of extra oil on your skin during the day.  But it works exceptionally well; with the first use I could feel a distinct difference in the cleanness of my skin.  I think this one is a definite winner and had originally given the product 5 stars.  I am, however, updating my review for the SECOND TIME because the price of this cleanser doubled after I first ordered it, then a couple weeks later went back to its original price.  $12 for 5 ounces is acceptable; $22 is not, so just keep an eye on price changes.",3
4,"A really nice product, good for sensitive skin.",3
5,"I was very pleased with the product, it was the perfect shade for my skin.  I just wish the bottle was bigger.",3
4.0,"First off, this is a very large clip.  I am petite, but I have a pretty big head, and you can see the edges of this clip when you are looking at me straight on.  To be honest, I like it.  I feel it gives a kind of and alternative fashion feeling like wearing your hair up with chopsticks might.  I think it is a fun alternative on some days.  That being said, that wasn't exactly what I was expecting when I bought it.  To be fair, though, it does manage to grab all of my hair at once which not many clips of this style can do. And the grip on it is very good.  My hair is quit slippery and I usually can't keep it in a hair tie even just while I'm sitting at my desk, or my hairstyle will come undone.  Sometimes the hair tie will just fall out.  With this clip, I have thrown my hair up without looking in a mirror and cleaned my whole apartment and it never really budged or let any big chunks of hair loose.  For perspective, my hair is only slightly thicker than average, slightly more than shoulder length, and straight/wavy in texture.<br /><br />This product arrived on time and was in great shape.  I wish I could give it four and a half stars, but I can't and I really feel like the visibility of the underside of this clip is not properly represented on the page, so that is why I have knocked off a star.  Other than that, great product from Goody, as always.  And well shipped.",3
4,"According to my wife, this stuff is really working.  For some reason, at the age of fifty-something, her backside started breaking out.  She read about tis stuff in a &#34;health&#34; magazine and decided to try it.  the bottle says give it three weeks of use to see results, but my wife noticed a significant difference within a week.  The only down-side that cost it a star is this stuff is not very pleasant smelling.  It isn't horrible enough to kick her out of bed, but it is not perfume-like at all.",3
4,"Anyone who says this doesn't hurt like hell is a liar or numb.  Certainly fun to play with, especially for those tuffies who think they can take it.  I'm one of those, and I yelp when just ONE hair comes out.  I thought I'd see what it was all about since I wasn't about to spring for HUNDREDS of dollars for a &#34;No-No&#34; or some such electric torture device to trim my wild ear hairs and such.  Now I've just got to find a gal I dislike sufficiently who deserves this weapon ... either that or some masochist.",3
5,I love this eyeliner I was useing pencil and creamy pencil thing by maybelline and so far I like the gel better then both of them because it doesn't stick to the crease of my eye and dosent smudge or need to be fixed all the time and it's so much more easier to apply for me at least,3
5,Bought for wife - she loves them!!!,3
5.0,"This is my third Wahl Trimmer. It provides me the sharpest and safest way trim my beard. With proper care, Wahl Trimmers will last for many years. Excellent product.",3
5,"I have many stamping plates and this is a great product, with images bigger than other plates, designs very crispy and original. One of my favorite stamping sets ever!",3
5,I purchased this product for my mom after she was having trouble with eye infections and styes. She uses this product daily and has no more issues with her eyes. It was especially helpful after cataract surgery and needed to keep her eye areas clean.,3
5,"I bought this for my wife, she uses it daily. It has worked flawlessly. I would definately purchase another if required.",3
5,"I first tried Nourish Organice Rejuvenating Argan Butter on a whim, when it was on a great sale.  I'm a convert now.  I have to be very careful with what I use on my skin and hair, as I'm allergic to so many things.  This product has nothing that bothers me, and my skin not only become very soft, but has mostly cleared up.  Before, I was still having breakouts and dry flaky skin....and I'm in my mid 40's.  Not cool.  You only need a very teeny tiny bit, and it goes a long way.  I can wear it under my makeup and I use it before I got to bed.  I was recently told by a &#34;makeup expert&#34; that I had great skin.  I've never been told that in my life.  Absolutely owe that to Nourish Organic.",3
5,"Great quality! Adjustable size, fits a large (child's) head. Great price $12. It even has the blond streak in it. My daughter dresses like Anna and is highly entertained! Very happy with the purchase!",3
5,This was one of many gifts to my son and he only likes these razors and this brand.  So far he still asks for them for Xmas.,3
5.0,"This cleansing gel is wonderful and works well for sensitive skin. Soapberry is a natural and eco-friendly soap that has been used for decades in India.  It leaves my skin soft and clean without stripping, drying or leaving build-up.  I really used only a tiny bit to wash my face comfortably so I think this will last me a while (4.2 fl. oz). Also love the shape and material of the bottle, it is very sturdy yet elegant and safe for children because it won't shatter.",3
5,I will purchase this product again.,3
5,"I love this perfume. Not only is it more than affordable, the scent is fresh & clean too. I always get compliments!!!",3
5,"I actually purchased this to hold my vaping juices and it works fabulously for that, anything 15ml and under will fit in the holders. It works so well my boyfriend has been begging me to get him one so I am! So if you vape and are looking for something handy to keep your juices in so they dont roll around while you're transporting them , look no further .just a different use for this besides the essential oils!",3
5,"I am so Irish, and I stay out of the sun.  I use this as my base makeup and it gives my face a nice glowing tint.  Doesn't look like I am wearing makeup at all.",3
4,"Easy to use and expectations were reached. Use this product between visits to the salon for waxing, would definitely recommend this product.",3
5,Classic scent.,3
5,"This is a nice mirror, but the mirrored surfaces could be a little  larger.  I like the 10x magnification for the fine work, but it's when I'm using the regular magnification that I wish the mirror were larger.  The stand has an attractive light brushed silver finish.  I received a damaged stand with my first order, but that was quickly remedied by Amazon.  The packaging is not very secure for a product of this type.  Overall, I recommend this mirror, but it's not an attractive gift as packaged.",3
5,"I have looked high & low for these Sally Hansen pedicure strips. It's almost impossible to find any of them, let alone these very cute &#34;Strike a Pose&#34; ones. Most of these are the same price for just 1 set... this item is 2! I love these nail strips, they are long lasting & easy to apply. I've stocked up so I never run out!",3
4,A little too good for me,3
5,"have been using this forever, love it",3
5,This product got rid of dark spots on my face and top of my hands.  I used it twice a day.  Would buy again but the shipping cost more than the product.,3
4,"Too soon to tell yet.  Most dermatologists say retinol, not prescribed, takes 8-10 weeks to see a huge difference. Anyway I like it, no redness or dryness. Plus I incorporate rosehip oil and peptides over the retinol.  Makes my skin soft.",3

5,"Love this product, light enough to use once a week with immediate results<br />LE*",3
4,"I was Happy with this Item, it Arrived tro me in a timely maner and it was exactly as discribed in the ad. I am yet to use the Item myself but the Item has been used by a friend of mine. the only thing that could have made this Item beter then it was  is instead of it comming with 2 liner machines, 1 liner & 1 Shader Machine would have been great. this wasnt a problem though I was able to order the part I needed to convert 1 of the machines to a shader for under $4.00 (+ s&h ) all in all I was very Happy with the Item and I would buy from this seller again...",3
5.0,"I've used this for years. I have long, fine hair and I spend a lot of time in the sun. This leave-in has no drying alcohol and has heat protection ingredients too. It makes my hair silky but not heavy. Try it before it's gone!",3
5,Love this straightener! Cost me far less than my CHI & heats up faster & gets my hair as smooth as silk!,3
5,I was terrified this wig might not be full enough and it turns out its one of the best wigs I own. It feels very much like real hair and looks Gorgeous on. The picture is exactly what it looked like on me! LOVE this wig!!,3
5,very good~ thx~,3
5,So glad I found this...great price and did the job I needed,3
4,This product really helped to repair my uneven skin tone. It does hydrate my skin even though it is a serum. It doesn't make my face break out in acne and it absorbs easily. A little goes a long way. I definitely recommend this for aging skin and I have tried many products.,3
5,"Using this for essential oils.  Rolls on great. Easy to fill. Doesn't leak, though I haven't traveled with it. I'm planning on getting more.",3
5,The slant edge is perfect for trimming tiny baby finger nails as well as adults and anyone in between. Highly recommended.,3
4,"ST conditions better than any lotion I have ever tried, and absorbs fully into the skin in seconds, providing a soft, pliable, full feel. It does not leave a thick gooey layer on top of the skin like some lotions. I enjoy the light coconut scent, and have had many compliments. But it's not natural; check the label!",3
5,"I wanted a stronger sunscreen than my typical SPF 15 because I'm 28 and am already starting to get sun spots on my face! I was horrified when I saw this and decided I needed something stronger. If this is good for a baby's skin, I figured I could try it on my face too. I really liked this sunscreen. I wore it on my face under my make up as a daily moisturizer. It's not oily, doesn't have a strong gross smell (it does have a mild non-offensive/benign smell), and it doesn't leave your skin feeling sticky or oily or white, flaky like some sunscreens meant for the body that you use on the face. I really was pleased with this and will continue to use it. The other product that I bought at the same time to compare the two was the Glytone SPF 40 facial sunscreen ( [[ASIN:B002D48QTS Glytone Sunscreen Lotion SPF 40, 4-Ounce Package]]). I really liked this one too, since my dermatologist recommended the Glytone brand facial cleanser which I have really liked. So I trusted Glytone. I was happy with both products, but this Hawaiian Tropic one is definitely great, especially for the price. I love that it's cheap enough that I don't have to feel badly about using it on my whole body when I'm outside too.",3
5,"If you like that incredibly yummy fresh fragrance on your skin as you are drying off after a bath you will adore this perfume, It somehow manages to grab that moment and let you hold on to it all day. It is fresh, clean and a little girly all in one. It is my favorite perfume in this price range. You will get compliments. It is lovely. :)",3
5,I love this product. I have seen a definite change. I use the eye cream as directed. The cream is gentle so there is no allergic reaction. It softens any noticeable lines leaving a more youthful appearance.,3
4,"Not being familiar with this type of product, I thought it was kinda odd... until I used it. Whoa!! This stuff is cool. It certainly extends and fills in your natural lashes. I brushed on one coat of my favorite mascara followed by a few swipes of the Prolash fibers (careful to not get in your eyes) and ended with another coat of mascara.  No denying the results. Comes off easily when washing your make up off, and certainly easy enough to apply even for those people that are not make-up savvy! (unlike false eyelashes!)",3
5,My daughter loved the colors and she wears them all the time.  I liked the size of the bottles because most of time we don't use all the polish.  Perfect for our needs.,3
4,"I bought this razor for my son. It is his first electric razor, he has only tried it once. He said it works great! It is lightweight and easy to use.",3
5.0,"This is a fantastic tool for us men as we age and hairs spring up. I've tried multiple things to keep the nose hairs under control from scissors to small Wahl clippers but this simple and well priced tool does the trick. Thouroughly recommend it. For those who say it cuts them, don't jam it into you skin.",3
5,"After burning my hand a few times while winding my hair around my curling wand, I saw this glove being advertised on Amazon.  I figured I would give it a try.  It takes a little getting used to (grabbing your hair and holding it) but no more burns!  I love this glove and would recommend it very highly to anyone suffering from burning their hands while trying to curl their hair.  Love it!",3
4,If you can't take the pain from waxing I suggest you don't try this... I like to think I have  a good tolerance for pain and this pushed my limit but after getting the hang of it.... I did get used to it. It also does work like threading.... it's cheaper than waxing and much easier.,3
4,"The size and style were exactly what I was looking for. The mounting mechanism leaves a little to be desired, leaving the mirror tilt downward from its mounting points, but can be corrected by gluing a block lower on the mirror.  What truly impressed me was the customer service.  The first two mirrors I ordered had manufacturing defects along the edges of both mirrors.  Once I took pictures of the problem, the company were quick to send me good replacement mirrors.",3
4,"No complains, my wife use it every day. (Good hair dryer, Oster Professional 76932-710 Wall Mount Hair Dryer )  Great!.",3
4,This is a great electric razor. It provides a comfortable and pretty close shave. I'm still on the first charge and it's almost been two weeks so the battery life is really good as well.,3
5,The product works great. It's in perfect condition and came with all the pieces! I use it all the time!,3
5,My hair is very difficult to detangle. I followed the directions and 30 seconds after spraying my hair I was able to comb through it.  Excellent!,3
5,AWESOME!!!!,3
5,Perfect product for at-home shellac manis.  Super easy to use and extremely durable.  Bought with a CND color set of 6 colors...,3
5,nice,3
5,"These stay on and protect my nails allowing me to go for over a week between manicures.  They also protect my nails from breaking when doing chores. They go on easily and smoothly and don't show under my manicure.  For added endurance, I attach with a nail glue.",3
5,"I have a little girl who temporarily has to wear this item and she HATES it so much.  All that means is, it is working like it is suppose too.",3
5,This seriously works people! My husband got this for me as a bday gift. I tried it out and thought ... ok it works but you do have to go over quite a few times to totally remove the hair. (Used on side burns) Directions says to use every 2nd day for 1 month and then after you only need to use it every 5-6 weeks. It is a process but it seriously works! I can go six weeks without redoing it. It has been a year and I do not regret it! The embarrassing facial hair is gone without constant waxing that lasts half that time! I do need replacement tips and and buffing pads which are quite pricey! about $50.,3
5.0,A product very hard to find! I feel so fortunate to have found it,3
5,Saline for sensitive eyes really works. No tearing,3
4,They are awesome. I like the package they came in. I don't need to buy anything to put them in. They work very well I love it,3
5,The wet/dry ceramic hair straightening iron was exactly what I was looking for and I'm happy with the purchase.  It was a great gift!,3
5,"Great product, I think it's good enough that I will start selling it myself.",3
5,I don't know why it is so difficult to find this great toothbrush.  It is soft and gentle on the gums and yet very resilient and strong enough to clean teeth.  Unfortunately it is extremely difficult to find truly extra-soft (not baby-soft) toothbrushes.,3
4,"This will be the 2nd can I have purchased. Recommended since I have had the Keratin treatment in my hair and I live in the humid south. I use it mainly on the crown of my hair. As reviewed by another/others, the nozzle does become &#34;glued&#34; after awhile. I find I have to keep the nozzle and top clean by running hot water over it. I like the spray enough to have ordered the 2nd can even though it will require maintenance.",3
5,"i use it for every occasions, the colors on this resembles to may MAC products, i use it to copy many makeup artist on youtube",3
5,We have been using Sonicare electric toothbrushes for about 9 years.  My wife's finally died and we replaced it with unit.  She is happy with it and likes the UV sanitizer.<br /><br />I use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products. I do this so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product. You can look at my review which will be close to my purchase date and tell how the product is doing as time passes.  I am not associated with any company and all opinions are my very own.<br /><br />UPDATE: It has been about 8 months since we purchased this toothbrush.  It is used at least once a day and is still going strong.  No problems.,3
5,Loved this soap...hated to see the company quit making it...,3
4,"I've used this flat iron 3 times so far. It works great on dry hair! It heats up and stays hot the entire time unlike my last straightener that constantly was trying to re-heat as I was fixing my hair. My hair is really silky when its done just like advertised. I can't decide if I like using it on damp hair, it seems to take a long time. It works, and gets the hair straight, but I think blow drying it and then straightening takes less time....I would suggest it for others regardless.",3
5,Hubby has worn this for four decades and just a whiff lights my fire--lasts throughout the day. A good investment.,3
5.0,"this carrot cream works great with the hair roots, they helped strengthen and deepen my 360 waves.",3
5,"Where I live these barrettes are hard to find, so I was pleased to find them here. They can hold a lot of hair and they open and close easily.",3
5,"once you get the hang of how to use it, it's very effective.<br />follow the instructions and you'll get the job done.",3
5.0,Love it,3
5,"I used this while in Mexico for the first time.  It protected my skin really well and I did not get a sunburn.  Being from the Pacific NW, it is saying something!",3
5,"My daughter purchased Eau Belle for me when she was in Paris quite a few years ago and I have been on the hunt for it since that bottle was emptied.    After searching for years to find it at some of the better stores in my area I gave up.    Recently I decided to check Amazon.com and \\""lo and behold\\"" there it was - and FREE SHIPPING to boot!    Needless to say, \\""I am Very Happy\\"".",3
5.0,"Good, although it's a little different from that I expected.",3
5,Product is great...I saw results immediately. It's not harsh on the skin like most abrasion products. The delivery time was excellent. It arrived much earlier than I expected. I will keep buying this product.,3
5,I love this shaver. It is low in sound and shaves very vell. Very smoth in use. It is a top quality.,3
5,"The first delivery had to be denied, the box it was delivered in was saturated with oil.  The packing was horrible.  They fixed the problem, it was just annoying to have to deal with the tracking and reporting.  AMAZON was great they fixed everything.  But the vendor should know better to wrap the items to make sure they don't leak.  The product quality was great.",3
5,"Excellent brush with good quality bristles, and it's the same length as regular toothbrushes unlike ones dentists give away which are short and cheaply made",3
5.0,Hard to find a replacement for the one I have had for 10 yrs.  This works like it should.,3
5,"No BS, this product WORKS no lice at all from the dirty classroom environment . No lice in 4 years ever since using this. Get it and protect your children from the other dirty kids. Spray it once before they leave for school in morning and even do their bookbags and jackets. No more &#34;cooties&#34; here!",3
5,On time delivery and product was what i expected,3
5,nice moisturizer.  love it because it doesn't have junk ingredients in it.,3
5,Awesome storage! It is a bit small but it fits all my mineral loose pigments and eyeliners! I love that it also has lipstick slots! Very good quality!,3
5,"This eyelashes growth serum is great, It's more than a week now, since I gave this to my sister for her to try this, and so far she's loving this.She told me that her eyelashes are getting thicker. There is no hairfall too when she's using a curler.She would love to purchase more of this product.Thanks for the seller in giving a discount for this product in exchange of my review.My sister really loves this so much.",3
5,Love these,3
5,"The early 2000s called, and they want to remind you about this lovely scent,",3
4,"I'm giving this only 4 stars because I can't find the 90 Yard version anymore! It lasts three times as long with 1/3 the packaging... But I do like this floss, it doesn't break as much in my tight teeth, but still gets them clean.",3
4,"I absolutely love the shampoo and the conditioner.<br /><br />It took me a few tries to get used to it, but after a few washes I fell in love with it.<br /><br />Sometimes I have to wash my hair twice to get the clean feel when I have been working out, but just knowing that it is all natural, chemical free and organic makes it all worth it.<br /><br />My MAJOR complaint is the screw on cap. It is very inconvenient. It makes the bottle look fancy and all, but it is a pain to have to find a place to place to put it and sometimes I pour too much shampoo on my hand.<br /><br />I would give it 5 starts otherwise...",3
5,"The combination of products with the conditioner did a tremendous job on my hair! Definitely reduced the shedding. I have trichotillomania, and my hair is easy to fall out because I pick on it. This definitely helped me prevent some bald spots.<br /><br />Smells super good, too. Not too floral, so it's good for men. My bf uses this as well.",3
4,Fantastic colors and I love the texture.   BE seem to know how to make gloss not so sticky.  Does it plump?  Well I'm not so sure it's a radical difference other than you have now applied a nice shiny color to your lips and you notice them more.   I wouldn't expect a miracle to happen but the shades are great and it's not all goopy.,3
5,Love it!,3
5,Very good,3
5.0,"Works beautifully for me but I'm seated on a stool.  I read the complaints regarding the difficulty keeping the mirror at its proper height, and yes, from the first seconds the neck of the mirror slid down.  Still, as I mentioned the view was not an issue.<br /><br />If you're standing or tall, this is probably not the mirror for you.  I'm seated at a tall countertop; I'm 5'6&#34;, the mirror is at it's lowest point and it's perfect.  The reflection is clear and the magnifying is beyond frightening; but my bad; I bought the thing to torture myself--it's not the mirrors fault.  These should be against the law!<br /><br />If you want a clean view and a wide picture in which to apply your make-up, you won't be sorry.  I'm sure I could raise the mirror neck if I really wanted to; it simply wasn't necessary.",3
5,I have had TMJ for over 20 years. Done everything there is to do to help take away the pain. One of those things was buying an expensive mouth piece from the dentist. This works just as well and is more comfortable. The slim-comfort size is perfect for my small mouth.,3
4,It works so great. I broke my left wrist and was in a cast for nine weeks.  I will be using the stand after I can use my left wrist. It is very sturdy and adjust to different hights.,3
5,Everyone was perfect.,3
5,I guess this is about the best product to use for keeping the gnats off of you..but it isn't a cure. The only cure is to MOVE!!,3
5,"I'm addicted to these. I never have to wash my face before bed, I just keep these in my nightstand. Nicely moist, without getting gross or weird. Good at removing makeup and grime.",3
4,I am happy with this purchase.  Not my favorite scent ever but overall I am extremely satisfied based on the price point.  You can't beat it,3
5,"I LOVED this perfume! It was MY perfume, you know, the one you are always looking for and then BAM! It's finally there!<br />I don't get why Dior has discountinued it (like a lot of Dior perfumes).<br />The low note is, I think, white musk and it really does smell like water! But good water! It's hard to explain...<br />Anyway... hope they will produce it again...",3
5,"I was looking for an all in one type product when I purchased this. After about a month of using it , I didn't experience any breakouts, actually I think it helped to keep the monthly hormonal cystic acne down. This is not a moisturizer so you definitely need to put something after applying. It has a nice citrus smell and I would purchase again.",3
5,It Shipped on time and product works amazingly. The Bottle was plenty big enough and would recommend it to anyone.,3
5.0,Adorable! was perfect for my daughter at Disneyland and at Ariel's breakfast. She was showing all the princesses her 'dinglehopper' bow:),3
4.0,Like it.. but can use a store bought product and get better results,3
5,This wasa gift for my daughter who loved the wild colors and variety,3
5,Great Brush!,3
5,It takes a good 3 coats to get it looking just right but it's super cute once it's all done. I have gotten many compliments on it. Make sure to use a base coat though. I didn't the first time I used it and I had a REAL hard time trying to get the sparkles off.,3
5,I enjoy using the Yankee Candle Lip Gloss.  I don't know why they stopped selling it in the Yankee Candle stores.  Hummm?  These lip glosses stay on your lips longer than any other ones that I have tried.,3
5,I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS LIP GLOSS. IT IS NOT STICKY AND IT'S A PRETTY NUDE COLOR WITH A LOT OF SHIMMER. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!,3
5.0,It's good mascara.,3
5,This product is one of the best out there. I have been using this product for over 20 years. I receive many compliments on my face. I have tried many other other products...This by far is one of the best investments you can make for your face.,3
5,This color has apparently been discontinued.  I've been wearing it for several years.  So HAPPY to finally find it!!!,3
5,Every once in a while everybody gets a few flakes of dandruff. While I don't use Head & Shoulders regularly we do have it in the shower for those occasions when we need to use it. If I notice a problem I just use Head & Shoulders for about a week or two and the issue is solved.<br /><br />This has been the old standby to cure this problem for a long time. It is gentle enough to use every day and leaves your hair feeling fresh and clean. I like this product and it works well!,3
5.0,"Last spring I  tried three different skin care lines and have not been impressed, until I tried this serum. I am completely amazed at the product. All of the reviews were right. Your skin feels brand new and you're left with beautiful smooth skin for your foundation. I've already told my mom and several friends. Thank You Nexgen!",3
5.0,Best facial product I have ever used! This is a great line and worth the price,3
5,"I switched from Philishave to Braun Series 7 because I was not longer satiesfied with the old system.<br /><br />On MY face the Series 7 comes with a better result, especially at the throat the result is really good.<br /><br />What I also love is the handling. The shaver fits comfortably in your hand. And cleaning is finished much faster then with my old Philishave.",3
5,I love the scent and the product.  I am sorry the company has discontinued making it.<br /><br />It came in perfect shape and I was happy to get it,3
5,"Have used Tommy Cologne for many years. It smells great, not fruity or flowery.  It is getting harder to find. Glad Amazon still has it.<br />(This review written by Bun's husband)",3
5,"I have been using this for two months now, and it is AMAZING! I got this from Costco first because I didn't see it here and I don't know how the prices compare but I'm getting a prescription for this stuff WOW!...<br /><br />I am in dry dry Colorado and my skin is usually a nightmare (before this stuff). I use a TON on my face and ZERO breakouts. This is like night and day. The accutane would be wreaking havoc on my face but because of my liberal application this stuff is keeping it looking amazing. Like Whoah. I use this on my entire body and it doesn't smell and isn't oily and is cheaper than that other brand junk that smells fruity and costs a million $. Cannot recommend more!",3
5,"Great product to remove callus and thick dry skin on feet. Follow the directions, don't leave on too long and wear gloves during application.",3
5.0,Great little bottle,3
5,"I really like this product.  You do have get use to it, but it does an excellent job of keeping the hair away.   Normally to get results like this, you would have to go to a PROFESSIONAL.  However, this device will soon pay for itself in 3 months or so.   No more having to drop [money] to go see the cosmetologist everytime the hair grows back!!!!  Other customers have said that this thing hurts.  Of course it does!!!  Most hair removal techniques do hurt.  My first time did cause discomfort, but it was nothing compared to waxing (especially when it came to doing my legs).  And if could get use to the pain (however brief) of waxing, I can certain get use to the discomfort of this.   I strongly recommend this product.",3
5,"While on vacation, I contracted an itchy rash (bug bites, allergic reaction, or both) which plagued me for 6 weeks.  I slathered myself with Benadryl gel, Cetaphil lotion, and even tried a prescription cream - all provided minimal temporary relief but the rash persisted.  I was using a mild soap with Donkey Milk which also gave me some relief but once I started using this cream, the rash was gone within a week's time!<br />Unfortunately, I attract mosquitos & fleas and their bites will itch for weeks.  Recently, I got several bug bites on the back of my leg & hip.  I used this cream and... voila!  No more itching, actual overnight relief!  I'll also rub some of the leftover cream on my lips and now they are very soft with no more dry lines!<br />For me, this truly is a MAGIC cream because it really works!  LOVE IT!!!",3
5,"Goods you received you are very happy<br />,, You are the best of the seller",3
5,"I got this epilator after using the Remington Smooth and Silky for over a year.  It just died so I figured I'd try another.  So far I like it.  It's louder than my previous epilator, but I really like that the head is detachable and washable.  The Remington model was not and it was hard to keep clean.  It seems to work very well.",3
5,"The ad shows ladies feet, but my man feet look great!",3
5,I love these they work better than a washcloth and if you let them dry out in between washes they stay somewhat sanitary. Word for the wise...you need to either throw then out after a few months or boil them so the bacteria does not build up and cause more of the problems your probably trying to cleanse away.,3
5,"it was perfect, great shampoo for a fraction of what local stores would have charged me",3
5,Wonderful product at a GREAT price! Get what you pay for here. Quality and then some! Just a dab works GREAT!,3
4.0,They are nice but are travel size.,3
5,"The material is medium weight, but it will softer after washed, the price is very good. the similar material I bought  to make the set costs me more than the already made set here.<br /><br />Even I like the set, I have to return it because the set is too long for me. I am shortie .  I guess it is suitable for someone about 5'5 or taller.<br /><br />Anyway, it is well made with the price is almost a half of what I made for myself.<br /><br />So, if you are average or tall person, the set is perfect for you.<br /><br />Feed Bad that I am too short to wear.",3
5,"I have sensitive skin that gets little bumps and rashes and itches if anything hard touches it. After turning 30 noticed my skin changed so i wanted to start to try to slow down the aging process. After reading reviews and not wanting to try harsh chemical peel no matter how gentle it says it is, I decided to purchase this product.  Very, very pleased.  It gets rid of rashes, fine lines and gives skin that is soft, dewey, and glowing, without foundation like I'm 18 again. Would definitely purchase again and recommend.  Oh and the reviews where people say its hard to remove, its not that bad, i use a hand body washer that is mesh from target and gentle exfoliate it off my face.  Trust me you wont be sorry.",3
4,"Starts out with a very strong odor, but dissipates rather quickly. Mixed with other items to help with mosquitoes - didn't do much.  It did however, attract a few cats who loved my door.  I think it is a good product, depends on why you buy it, & the service was great.",3
5,I love this product... it paid for its self in the first week... I picked up one for my daughter and will be picking up another for my neice.,3
5,Better quality then I thought!,3
5,I love this product. i have color treated curly hair that can look frizzy & dry.  This is the only thing that makes my hair look like HAIR again.  can't live without it,3
5,"I've been using this product for years, and in different shades.  It's very easy to use, it comes with a pair of disposible gloves and hair conditioner and the bottles you need to mix.  It covers all of my gray nicely.  My only complaint is that it doesn't last as long as I'd like.  The color starts to fade and it seems sooner than regular dye, but the good part about that is you don't get a \\""root line\\"", it's more of a gradual fade from roots to color especially if you keep coloring on top of the color you have.  It doesn't burn your skin or your eyes.  It doesn't come off on your pillow.  It doesn't smell strong.  After you shampoo, there's no smell either.  And it's easy to change color.  I have medium length, straight hair and I need two boxes to do all my hair from scalp to ends.  I only need one box for the roots touchup.  I usually buy this at Wild Oats, but they're always sold out of this color.  It must be popular.  I have brown hair (with lots of gray) and this comes out looking light, light brown, almost blonde.  If I'm in the sun a lot, the color brightens up into a blonde.  It also works as a good base color if you want to do highlights on top because it's not too blonde that it overwhelms the highlights and it's not too brown, it's a nice blending color.  And you can use this color on top of the highlights and the highlights will show through.  Great product.",3
4,"The necklace was nice, but there were no directions on how to construct the bracelet. So getting it as a bonus item was absolutely useless.",3
5,The Trimmer Comb was delivered on time. I used the comb and it works to my satisfaction. Now I don't have to see the barber as much and save some money.  Jimbo,3
4,Basicly happy with the purchase.  My only complaint is that a couple colors we're not filled as much as the rest.,3
5,You read several reviews from a ladies perspective (and smell)<br />I have been wearing 360-light blue for 8 years and never had a<br />negative reaction. Many ladies have actually complimented me.<br />YEAH BUDDY !!!,3
5,"Excellent product - finest fragrance of the World! Difficult to get, why?<br />There would be a strong market in Europe!<br /><br />Regards,<br />Emanuel Berger",3
5,The curved shape is great - no sharp edges.  These work quickly and the shape conforms well to filing and smoothing nails.,3
4,"These sed hair extenders are nice, but not as portrayed.  I thought from the description that each one would emit a certain color.  In fact they change collors and flash.  I can certainly live without the flashing.  The will look great in my horse's main when we run our carriage at night.",3
5.0,"love the color-tried to find it in stores when I ran out and literally bought 3-4 other colors instead, but they just didn't look right.  Hopefully OPI reconsiders discontinuing this color... please!!!",3
5,"i have very dry skin on my nose and bit on cheeks,they constantly peel, but also feels oily, i tried many stuff from  vaseline to all kinds creams, i got or too oily skin,or kept peeling,another one clogged the pores and got blackheads... finally got this cream i got for a gift and its excellent, soft good smell and healthy skin! yippee",3
5,"The Sally Hansen Salon Effects nail stickers are FANTASTIC!!!  They last well over a week, are easy to apply, easy to get off with nail polish remover, and come in so many cool designs!  I get complements on my nails all the time!!",3
5,Love these hair clips!!!<br />Not too big for a baby,3
4,I really love this one!!!,3
5,"Only mousse I use. Great control, but not sticky and hard.  This product is aimed at women of color and I am not a woman of color - well, I can't say I'm without color since I'm kinda taupe - but anyway, I do have very curly/frizzy hair, and this is my favorite product.",3
5,"This is extremely easy to work with, we started doing our own nail art and this set makes professional results even for me with no training I just watched videos online",3
5,"It is the best sleep mask I have ever worn.It is very comfortable. I have bought many different kinds over the years,but this one , is by far the best.",3
5,Works great.,3
5,Very good,3
4,"Very good, after washing hair or wet hair when using this comb, hair loss, decreased significantly.The price is still not close to the people",3
5,"I totally love this stuff. I got a prescription for it from my dermatologist (he actually had the bottle at the&#34;front desk&#34; for $15), but I skipped that offer and looked on Amazon and got the exact same thing for 1/2 the price. I have recommended this to a number of friends that have ridges in their nails. Just do what the instructions say and your nails will look great!!!!",3
5,"This is the best diffusor I think I have ever found.  It fits my dryer well and the size and shape of the \\""bowl\\"" of the difusor is large whough to hold lots of curls.",3
5,"Always love Maybelline. Great mascara, does not clump and is great for layering mascara for thick dark eyelashes. I would recommend this to anyone",3
4.0,"I was given this product on a recommendation. At first I was skeptical as I have been ultra sensitive to other products that have promised to reduce the look of wrinkles. I have to say I am very impressed. It's light and smooth, absorbs quickly and their are no heavy scents. My skin has responded well and I do notice a difference. My &#34;laugh lines&#34; are diminished and my neck looks nice and smooth. Very happy with this and would recommend it to anyone. Delivers on it's promise!",3
5,"Really fantastic plates. With so few reviews on these, I was hesitant about ordering these after getting burned by the high rated Red Angel bundle that turned out to be garbage for me, but I'm so glad I did. This has turned out to be one of my favorite bundles. I've used a lot of different brands of image plates and these rank right at the top. I'd easily put these up against my Konad.<br /><br />I've been playing around with a lot of the images and can't find anything to complain about. There's a good variety of designs. Of course, in every bundle of this size there's going to some images that don't appeal to everyone, but overall, I thought the selection was really good (as you can see from the images Amazon provides). They're along the lines of any of these bundle packages. I like the full nail designs best and there are a lot useful ones in this bundle. There's some immature designs (like unicorn, horse, dolphin, ghost, kitty, rainbow,etc), but a good selection of more sophisticated ones as well. Since I use these for myself and my young nieces I'm really happy with the selection.<br /><br />The quality is excellent. There are no rough edges. All the images are well defined and transfer polish very well to the nail. These plates are worth a lot more than the $12.99 price I paid.<br /><br />If you're into nail stamping art, you can't go wrong with these. As I stated, the quality is really good, and even if you're quite picky and don't like all the images, at the $12.99 price, I can't see anyone being upset with these plates, unless they don't know how to stamp (it takes practice and experimenting).<br /><br />Also, I can't believe how fast I got these (sold through ProSource DisCounts Inc, MASH Nails). I have the two day shipping and shouldn't have gotten them until Tuesday (ordered late Friday night), but they came on Monday. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.",3
5,I order this item and it came quick just in time for winter. I like this lip balm because it<br />gets rid of dryness quickly and keeps lips nice/soft.,3
5,"I bought this for my mom as a gift and it was excellent. The walgreens products do not work. Ocean Drive Skin Care helped the dark circles around my mom's eyes and left her skin feeling soft. Very good product and worth every penny , I highly recommend this product",3
5,Good product,3
5,"I love that it is made by the women in the area & that it is a natural, organic product",3
5,Great bath chair,3
5.0,Smells great works great and feels great after using,3
5,"Enjoying how my teeth look. Someone asked me if I got veneers. Haha. Anyway, only after people ask I tell them I use Shine Whitening.",3
5,"The market is filled with ant-aging products and even though we have many too choose from, some rarely work. Like I have mentioned in past reviews, no oversight like in the supplement world, so most products just have to not hurt you and they are really overlooked and still being sold. I spent the last few weeks testing out serums to devices that help with aging skin. It's so hard knowing I invested a few weeks and a product just did not deliver what was stated.<br /><br />Thankfully, Oz Naturals was not one of them!<br /><br />I love retinol and especially one that did not cost an office visit. Yes, the prescriptions are not as costly as one would think but the office visits cost money and refills require another office visit. It gets up there and I honestly do not feel I am need of the prescription strength, yet. I prefer to not over medicate my face because if I up the potency, I also up the side effects and with Summer around, I also up my chances of getting a red and peely face. I'm all for anti-aging but shedding skin like a lizard is not sexy no matter the bikini you wear!<br /><br />Oz Naturals has a 2.5% retinol serum, which contains Astaxanthin and Vitamin E. The formula is a strong orange hue in color that always makes me think the retinol oxidized, as yellow is the first tinge you see when it does, followed by the orange color that comes after. Thankfully, this is just a coloring from the ingredients versus a serum going wonky and I prefer getting pass the color versus a dye being added to just calm my fears. That is what Oz Naturals does, it offers a natural approach to your skincare's needs.<br /><br />Ingredients (as listed on website): Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), HamamelisVirginiana (Witch Hazel), Pentylene Glycol, Phospholipids, Retinol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Organic SimmondsiaChinensis (Jojoba Oil), TriticumVulgare (Wheat Germ Oil), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Organic Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea), WildcraftedResinaPropoli (Propolis), Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.<br /><br />Astaxanthin: This was an ingredient that I had heard of but was not familiar with, as not any of my beauty products contain it. It's a carotenoid and an antioxidant. It's what they feed salmon when people for some reason want to see a pinker/orange hue in their fish. It does not convert to retionol (Vitamin A), however research which is still limited, has reflected it may aid with inflammation, oxidation and even UV damage. I like that it's simple and as long as it's derived naturally and not in it's synthetic form, it has the potential to help and protect against oxidative (free-radical) aging skin.<br /><br />Verdict:<br />I love serums because my skin loves them. They absorb quickly and that means less residue and you don't feel that heaviness that some creams tend to leave behind. Most serums play well with cosmetics and because I have increased my retinol use to both day and night use, just making sure I use sunscreen in the day to avoid redness or hyper-pigmentation issues. The latter part would kind of go against what I am trying to do (save my skin), so please don't skip on your SPF. I used the serum for a total of 3 weeks and like always, I am going from one 2.5% retinol brand to another. I will notice if a product works if it does or does not maintain the progress I have previously achieved, and I can then measure if the new serum brings anything new to the party. Even though Oz Naturals is orange in color, it did not leave a orange colored goop that was hard to hide. My skin absorbed the serum with no problems! I did notice that my skin at week two had a nicer and more pleasant texture. My skin had a glow that the previous retinol serum did not add. It was not an oily glow but just a healthy one and because I suffer from horrible seasonalallergies, this is something that unfortunately always reflects on my face and sadly my skin. The glow I got sort of helped make me look healthier and less tired, so it took attention away from the signs of having bad allergies gives you. I'll take it! Any serum that can do more than just deliver retinol is what I seek. I'm always looking to simplify my routine and I literally went from Oz Naturals 2.5% retinol serum to then moisturizer at night, and done! Just switch to an SPF moisturizer in the day and it's the easiest and most effective duo I have found, so no excuses that you have no time for your skin. With Oz Naturals, you will only need 3 minutes to get what I consider a good anti-aging beauty regimen, so you can even do it while brushing your teeth :)<br /><br />I received the above product(s) free of charge from Oz Naturals.

5,My parents are so set in their ways and I've been looking high and low for this brand & came up empty handed until I found it here on amazon! Great product according to them & it seems like they won't be changing brands any time soon either! Shipping & delivery a little slow from Pharmapacks but still a really great price!,3
5.0,Great moisturizer that is quickly absorbed and non greasy. Highly recommend.,3
4,removes the hair,3
5,"Fast shipping and the product seems to be holding up. I've used other atomizers and roller ball bottles but this one has no leaks, no spills.",3
5,"I have tried herbal remedies that were okay.  The healing time is so much FASTER, no scabbing, no blisters, no bleeding.  I put it on before bed and leave it on until I replace it with the Day Patch in the morning. Healing time for me is usually 5-days which is AMAZING!!!  When going out at night I apply the Night one, add make-up & lipstick & no one can tell that I am wearing it.  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT, if you are looking for a Quick healing time.  I don't feel like anyone is staring at me, since the sore is hidden.",3
4,"I like this foundation. It's nice and smooth and goes on nicely. It gives me good coverage. My only complaints are that it feels kind of heavy and it smells funny. When I wear it, I always wonder if people can smell my foundation because that's how strong it is to me. But I got it for a good price and overall it is a good foundation. I do recommend!",3
5,"I love a beautiful scar free body, and that's from my head to my toe.  All those private areas are important as well, and this cream does lighten the intimate areas.  It would be wonderful to afford the finer spas that provide those type services, but using the products I know about still works for me.  Who ever said those places couldnt be just as beautiful as the rest of your body.",3
5,Excellent!!,3
5,"grows hair. I use minoxidil more than 5% with Finasteride and Nizoral 2% shampoo. I am norwood 5A and been using Minoxidil for 4 mos now. lots of vellus hair growing by using these big 3 they call it. (big 3 = Nizoral 2%, Finasteride 1.25mg and Minoxidil)<br /><br />I don't know if it will grow hair on slick bald/ shiny bald head. Ive read there should be a vellus hair left in order for minoxidil to work on.",3
5,The wife loved it.  Just what she was looking for.  Will be looking for more in the future.,3
5.0,"Purchased for my daughter for prom. Hair up in curls, Looked beautiful. Clip was surprisingly bigger than I expected and it matched perfectly<br />with her dress. Would highly recommend!!",3
5,One of my favorite OPI polish colors.  I always use OPI.,3
4,I really like Dutchess a lot. I just think I'm way past the point that the bronzer will do much for me! I love the fresh scent it leaves me with after I tan! Queen is a better for for me. I love lotions that have the butter in it. It leaves your skin moisturized all day long. Don't get me wrong I'm a huge fan of this lotion. I have just been tanning since I have been 17 now I'm 30. If your like me than Queen which is a huge bronzer factor will work better. This is a good started lotion for someone who has not been tanning forever!,3
4,"Like this convenient to use hair clipper because of its built-in different hair length trims. This hair clipper allows you to choose from 12 hair length setting i.e. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 mm etc till 23 mm. I absolutely love this feature as I can adjust it to the length that I require without having to re-trim my hair when I use the current one that does not have the length fixed.<br /><br />My wife loves this clipper as she can easily and confidently clip my hair to the length projected without fear of clipping them unevenly. She loves that this is slightly lighter than the current one that we are using too.<br /><br />This seems like a all-in-one solution clipper for us with adjustable length, lightweight and easy to wash blades i.e. just pop out the blades for washing off any hair stuck.<br /><br />Great product from Philips!",3
5,"I have tried all of the brand name cleaners for my gas permeable contact lenses but find these do the best job of keeping them clean. With others I've used, after a while my lenses aren't coming as clean, seem cloudy. With this cleaner I never have that problem.",3
5,"WOW, That price is a BIG JOKE!!! Bought this one 2 years ago on Amazon for $15.16 and now it is $180?! Can I sell my used set back for $50?<br /><br />It is still working perfectly. One 8-hour charge last you roughly 2 months (I shave twice a week one is trimming and the other is clean shave, about 3-5 mins shave). Love the Mini Foil Shaver since it get the job done and can be open in 2 parts so you can definitely clean it easily. The trimmer did the job well.<br /><br />About travelling, just charge it before you go, unless you are going for a long trip. No indication that the battery is full is a small minus but I just left it the night before and can be sure I don't have to charge it again for another 2 months.<br /><br />Haven't used either of the comb so I have no comments on those<br /><br />Overall, this is a great set that can be comparable to other expensive Norelco shaver BUT the price here is certainly OUTRAGEOUS. You should not pay more than $30 for this.",3
5,"I was very skeptical about this tool before buying it, did not believe all the claims in the description. However, it does work! My skin looks so much better than before! You need to be very diligent and make sure to use it every day and stick with it even if it hurts and uncomfortable (the first couple of times). The first week I did not apply too much strength (when massaging) as it really hurt. In the consecutive weeks it became less painful and even pleasant! I have been using it every day for about 5 weeks now, and I definitely see significant skin improvement. I keep my “mitt” in the shower for easier access and use it with soap for easier sliding. I would not suggest it to use it just with water as there is too much friction, and there is a huge possibility for bruising. Overall, I am very happy!!!",3
5,I've had vitiligo for 21 years.  It has slowly taken over a large part if my body.  I decided to try this cream and WOW!  I've been using it for a month applying twice a day and using a tanning bed every other day.  My biggest issue now is I have so many freckles it's hard to blend them with my vitiligo using makeup!  I feel that with the result I'm achieving within a few months my face will be 100% normal.  Keep in mind approximately 70% of my face has vitiligo.  It's working on all parts of my body!  Give this cream a try it really does work!,3
5,Liked this product so much that I purchased a second one for a friend.,3
4,I say this in the mall for 4 times the price.  I like this product.  I recommend it to others to try.,3
5,Originally purchased this product in Mexico a couple years ago.  Just recently located it on Amazon.  Delivery was fast.  This appears to working better than anything I've tried previously,3
5,"A salon will charge you about $5 per strand for these, and they only last 2-6 weeks. While I think they're awesome, it is smarter to do it yourself. The instructions are included. It takes a few tries to perfect the technique, and it helps to have an extra hand, so do this with a friend! These can be styled with a dryer or iron, but I don't know about hair dye. You can comb/brush your hair, but use care around the knot to prevent pulling it out. These are stronger than a strand of hair, so they fall out from brushing at the knot. Careful combing and brushing will improve the longevity.",3
5,Sea kep shampoo  is great for my perm damaged hair.  It makes your hair so soft.  I getit here because it is a good price and delivery is very quick.,3
5,"When you have something in your teeth or your teeth are just a little off-color; your lucky if someone is kind enough to pull you aside and let you know.  Since most people are embarrassed to do so, you have to take matters into your own hands.  I have been using this Crest product since it first came out years ago.  Within a few weeks, those people that wouldn't say anything if you had the ugliest smile in the world were suddenly paying my complements and asking where I went to have my teeth bleached.  They are surprised to find that I get the same results with regular use of Crest 3D.  Let me end by saying, I can claim same results because I had my teeth bleached when I was a teenager and this toothpaste has brought back that same level of white that I had over fifteen years ago.",3
5,Great item.  Competitive price.  Fast shipment,3
5.0,I like this scent.,3
5,I originally purchased this item at a local beauty supply store. They stopped caring the product. The quality and price meets and exceeds what I use to purchase at the store. Thank You!  Five stars.,3
5.0,"Great cream, excellent buy!",3
5,This is the best hairdryer I have ever bought.  This brand is fantastic.  I am buying a flat iron today.,3
5,"I prefer the Au the' Vert but that scent wasn't available at the time so I decided to try the au the blanc and my 17 year old daughter LOVES this. You really can't beat the price. It's small bottles, but you're getting 15 ounces total, versus paying for three or six ounces from a department store. Good deal for the real product.",3
5,This product totally stops the &#34;frizzies&#34;!,3
5,I am african-American woman and have extremely coarse hair. I used the tangle teezer in the shower when conditioning my hair. I am so pleased. It gently detangles my hair with out breakage. Highly recommended to the kinky curlies out there.,3
5,works perfect on highly sensitive skin!,3
4,This is a great palette.  I have medium brown hair and it is easy to match to my eyebrows.  The only thing is that I wish that it had come with wax,3
5,i gave this a five star its very vintage and pretty but a little larger stone that I expected.  beautiful use for an engagement ring!,3
5,"I have been using it on my face and arms.  I haven't had to microwave it as some have recommended.  Rubbing it in my palms heats it up enough to go on smooth.  I can see a reduction in the lines around my eyes and my skin feels soft and more elastic.  I will buy it again....Eventually, this tub is going to last a long while",3
4,"I like the way this product textures my hair, however not as happy with the way I have to apply it.  It is like a deodorant stick so you have to smear it on your hands and takes getting used to that.  The positive about that is that you don't use very much of it at a time and the way it works you really don't want to use very much.  Maybe that is why it is set up to apply like that, but I still like it.",3
5.0,It is a shame that this product cannot be purched in stores anymore .I know when I find things that can be used by 3 or 4 females of my family the product becumes hard to get.  I would leke to see Bill Blass back in the market place.,3
5,"This is so much more then a bar of soap. I am very excited to be able to use this not only in a tub, but in diffent rooms for aroma calming, and gifts to my loved ones.<br />The nature of the is not only organic, but nature with in our home. I love it and recomend it to everyone.<br />I am so exciting to say, I am looking forward to more to come.",3
4,"I have had this hair weaved in for 6 weeks.  It is good hair.  If it was installed properly it would last up to 12 weeks with washes every 2 weeks.  It is human hair and with the humidity it frizzes up.  It lays just like my hair and has the same texture as my real hair.  The tracks are perfect, not too thick or too thin.  Worth the price.",3
5,"Past reviews have already covered everything. So, I'll just reiterate that the trimmer performs very well, is well priced, and the battery issue (dies after about a year) is barely a problem given how well their warranty works. I highly recommend this trimmer.",3
5,"Ladies, if you struggle with humidity and frizzy hair, then try this product. Follow the instructions by the manufacturer of this product and it will leave the hair soft, straight, looking healthy and shiny.",3
5,"GREAT CLIPS ----- HAIR,EVEN FINE, STAYS IN PLACE.",3
4,"The shipping was quick.<br />The product is great aside from the fact that it is drying but nothing a toner and moisturizer can't fix.  Prior to using this soap I had a huge flared cyst on my cheek and subsequently to using the soap it minimized it so much, enough that I'm not so self conscious about it.  The cyst hasn't gone away but it hasn't flared up since I've been using this soap.  I've been using for a month, mostly in the mornings.  I'm happy with the results thus far.",3
5,Perfect,3
5,"I found this product to do exactly what it says and was gentle on my hair. My hair is thick and wavy and I live in Florida. My hair looks SOO much better with 1/2 the effort. I dont agree with the other reviews. It did smell bad but i used 1/2 the serum and then 1/2 the blowdry cream. It wasnt a big deal. The results were silky hair with less density. My hair was a little dry by shampoo 7, but that could have been for other reasons too. A deep conditioner and air dry restored my hair.  Try it its great!",3
5,One of the best perfume smells besides the fancy ones and she loves it! Good present for boosting and advancing relationship,3
5,"I had looked for this cologne everywhere.  It has sentimental value and was a \\""must have\\"" Christmas gift.  The product was received on time and was exactly what I was looking for.  Will definitely order again!",3
5,This would cost probably $5-$10 at a store. Nice variety of different shapes & all my pockets has a generous amount of gems. Would deffinatly recommend for every nail guru !,3
5,"This shaver works as described. Using its lowest guarg setting, it easily handled my course, dark hair. I even used it, without the guard, to shave my inner thigh area. Worked like a charm!! This is the best shaver I've ever purchased.",3
5,"I have to say I enjoyed the price of this item......An affordable way to enjoy one of my favorite Renergie products. The full size jar is getting a little pricy, so the size and price of this jar was just perfect....Thank you    Barbara NYC",3
5,This product was the real deal!! Wish I could have found this deal again!!!! It was a reasonable price too!!!,3
4,"I like this product!<br /><br />I have long, super-thick, curly hair.  When the humidity is low, it will do whatever I want and look great.  When the humidity is high, it morphs into a huge, monstrous ball of tacky frizz.<br /><br />I've used smoothing lotions before that were unbelievably thick and gooey.  This is a much thinner lotion, which happily surprised me.  Now here's the trick to using this:  ignore the instructions to \\""rub a walnut sized amount of product\\"" into your damp hair.  Walnut sized?  That's crazy. On damp hair?  Nooooooo. Don't use more that a pea-sized amount, and use it on DRY hair, after you've finished styling it and before using any sprays.  You just want to smooth down flyaways and surface frizz, not douse your head in a vat of grease.<br /><br />I have to say I'm delighted with the results.  My hair looks smooth, not greasy, and doesn't frizz up quite so much in the humidity.<br /><br />I noticed other reviewers complaining about the scent.  I didn't remember anything offensive, so I just went and gave it a sniff.  Nope, smells pretty good to me.<br /><br />Recommended.",3
5.0,"Moisturizes the hair, smells nice, and my hair is less frizzy. I also feel like damage from flat iron is lessened while using this product. It is SO expensive but I am finding that since I wash my hair every other day it last a little longer.",3
4,"I  used  this product  for a  1 1/2  year  , it works !",3
5,My wife loves this skin care product. Bought it for her and she was very happy with it the results.,3
4,as a lover of great lotions and fragrances this little set is quite nice.  i get lots of compliments on the fragrances and it's nice to have more than one from which to choose.<br />keep the one you like best and make gifts of the others.  the cream is never greasy and a great size to carry in your purse.,3
5,"I was looking through my orders for something else and came on this, which I will soon be re-ordering. Victoria's review describes my own experience perfectly, except I'm a man. My barber, who also had thinning hair, turned me on to this in 1987. I was 37 and have searched to make sure I never ran out. I've tried a number of other products during the last 22 years and always have thrown them out or given them away. I attribute the amount of hair I still have on my head, in large part, to this product. I think something in it (the mucopolysacharides?) helps dissolve sebum and keep the follicles healthy. Regardless, it makes my hair look fuller and feel more natural than anything I've tried. If you have thinning or fine hair, buy it! (Also, it's so potent that, as a man, one of these 32 oz. bottles lasts well over a year. I only need a drop the size of a pea.)",3
5,These little brow combs are sturdy and last for a long time---much longer than others I have bought that break rather quickly. Glad I found these,3
5,"I ordered the Body Toolz Double Loop Facial Skin Care Tool and it arrived very quickly. ( A few days later ) I have used this for over a week now and I am very happy I made the purchase. I'm only sad that I didn't order one of these sooner, it could have prevented some scars I got by using my fingers. T_T It is made very well! at first I was nervous to put too much pressure, because I thought that I would snap the loop right off but nope! its very sturdy.",3
5,I have Dishydrotic Eczema which means my skin is very sensitive to chemicals and fragrances. I have been using the Jonathon filter system for 5 years now and it has made a big difference in keeping the eczema in check.<br /><br />My only wish would be that htere was a water saver button on it but I would highly reccomend this product to anyone with any skin/scalp issues.,3
5,These came exactly as promised and worked perfectly for my &#34;hand salve&#34;. They are sturdy and clean. Love them!,3
5,"I love it<br />It was exactly what I thought it was supposed to look like, and its pretty too. Good",3
5,"I love this toothpaste, just after a week my teeth already look whiter! It tastes great and leave my mouth feeling fresh!",3
5,"This soap is fairly mild,I soap up and leave it on for 2 minutes or so,then rinse off.<br />I skip a couple of days,then use it again.<br />I have light skin anyway,have been using this soap to help clear rash on my arms.<br />Careful on face area,use sparingly,you will feel it,then rinse off.",3
5,AMAZING. I had heard about lanolin through /skincareaddicts to use on chapped lips and it has been really good! My lips and fingers dry/crack up easily and especially in the cold.,3
5,"Every summer while I was growing up, I stay with my grandparents where they harvest coconut all year round, so it's all I can smell. Understandably, I've avoided anything with coconut smell & flavor. But since this came as a good deal & I've heard of the all-purpose benefits of it, after 15 years, I decided to get a jar. And, by gosh, this product is amazing. The smell is very faint & pleasant. It's soilid in a jar, but as soon as your fingers touch it, it melts into this glorious non-greasy oil that you can use practically for every part of your body to moisturize. I've used it on my skin & helped a lot with my cracked heels. With my hair, tried it as a conditioner, didn't rinse at first try so came out as a little greasy, but after a rinse with shampoo, my hair is shiny & smoother than it's ever been. And I have been hearing a lot about oil pulling that on a bored day, i tried doing that, and now I couldn't live without. My mouth always feels fresh & clean. Doing it for about 3 days, I have no doubt it may whiten my teeth eventually. Overall, everybody needs to have this on their vanity or in the bathroom counter. I would definitely repurchase. And do yourself a favor, get one!",3
5,"I have naturally wavy hair that sometimes wants to curl. I heard this shampoo would not dry out my hair and was good for waves and curls. I had used Burt's Bees Grapefruit Shampoo before and liked it a lot, so decided to try this one too. So far, it is better than I expected. It does not smell as good as the grapefruit one, but it is still nice smelling. My hair has been soft and shiny whether I wear it straight or curled. I have super thick hair, and the conditioner is great for removing tangles in the shower. I wash with this everyday and have experienced no buildup or dryness. It also cleans well. The products I use change from day to day depending on how I wear my hair. I sometimes use a holding moose and other times use coconut oil and gel for up-dos. Everything washes out clean. I am very happy with this product and will be buying it again.",3
5,Cool shampoo. It has a unique scent. Not sure if it will reduce my hair loss but you can definitely tell that it is a quality shampoo.,3
5,I love these products!  They are so refreshing in the morning!  Shipping was super fast!  I've bought from them before and have never been disappointed!,3
5,This back scratcher is a life saver. It is nicely made and scratches all the right itches. It is very sturdy and well constructed.,3
5,Shipping was incredibly fast. Product better than expected. LOVE IT!,3
5,"Wife used it and this was and is her first wand.  She said she isn't sure the design really does much to help other than maybe shape the curls a bit more, but she is overall pleased with the product",3
5,Love the product!,3
4,nice and thick. very nourishing  a great way to get magnesium. good for really dry skin if you have been in a cars works well!,3
5,I found this powder on Amazon for a great price so I purchased it to match the foundation I had purchased. It is not flakey and does not dry my skin out. This is important because I have very dry skin.,3
5,"I bought this soap for a recipe to make laundry soap. I will buy more to use instead of the soaps with all of the harsh additives. I don't have time to make my own soap, but I don't need to with Pure Soap.",3
5,I love this perfume this is my second bottle the first bottle I bought at WALMART then I could it find it any more untill I found it on here for a $1.45 you can't beat it it just came today in the mail I can't wait to wear it again.I have to say I love amazon they are fast and have gotten all my items on time that I have odered this is my favorite website.,3

5,"i've been wanting to get this lip color since it came out but did get to order it before it sold out. i noticed it was super expensive when it became sold out so i put off on getting it. however, when my girlfriend's birthday came around, shes a huge make up junkie.. i decided to get her a box filled with random make up goods. so i really had to get this lip color for her becos i know she'll love it. i ended up buying two! one for myself and one for my gf. i am so glad i got this for the both of us as she loves it and so do i!!! thank u!",3
5,"I've been using this product on and off for about 2 years now and I really like it. I don't wear makeup everyday so when I do wear makeup I want something light, and easy. I've always hated wearing foundation because it felt too heavy, and I've never really taken the time to put on moisturizer and sunscreen in the morning. I knew that I needed to be taking better care of my skin but I also know that I'm lazy. I knew the CC creams were for me because they put the moisturizer, sunscreen, and tint all in one. I did a lot of research to find one that would work best and fit in my budget. The Olay Total Effects Tone Correcting CC Cream consistently showed up on every &#34;10 Ten...&#34;, or &#34;Best of...&#34; list among product 3 and 4 times the price.  I love the fact that I don't have to buy and put on three different products. I love that it feels light on my face and doesn't look caked on. Sometimes (especially in the winter) I need a little more moisture than this product provides. I've had a little trouble finding the right moisturizer to layer with this product but I blame that more on the other moisturizer being too greasy. This is definitely a great everyday CC cream. The lightness that I love about this product doesn't allow it to cover flaws as well as heavier foundations do. I do have another foundation that I wear on special occasions, if I know there's going to be a lot of professional photos or video taken.",3
5.0,Love this eyeliner!,3
4,The button to close the flap was poorly sewn - after reattaching the button and adding a couple extra velcro strips to keep the opening on the bag from fallning open it was a pretty nice bag.  A gift for my 15 year old daughter who loved the bag.  but no points for the quality of the sewing the original button and lack of additional means of keeping the bag from falling open.,3
4,got this as a present for my dad. he was super happy. he says it gives him a close shave and he can't stop raving about how many  attachments there are! so id say its money well spent !,3
5,"This is by far the best hairspray I have ever worked with. Being a hair stylist I use many sprays and this one is perfect. Not heavy or sticky. If I need a little lift, I can tease the roots and spray a little and it holds without being sticky. Oh, some people don't like the smell,  it's fine for me. I also have the unscented.",3
5,Keeps her brushes nice and clean<br />works perfect with the Mash Nail Ait Brush Cleaner Cup<br />Glad i gave this to her for Xmas,3
5,"I have always spent a lot of money on Josie Maran's Organic Argan Oil , and I did love it.  I stumbled upon this on Amazon looking for a lower price for the Maran Oil.  I read the reviews, and thought I might give it a try (as a lot of reviewers compared it to the maran oil).  I found this oil to be a little lighter and not as heavy as the Maran oil.  Because of this it sinks into the skin easier and doesn't leave the oil slick on your face. I have never used this on my hair, as my skin needs more help.  I love that it is organic and truly can't find a big difference between it and the maran oil, except the huge markup in price for the maran oil.  I don't mind paying $$ for quality, but refuse to pay more just to fill up someone's pockets.  If it didn't do the job of the Maran oil, I'd pay more.  it does and for less than half the price ?? I'm in.",3
5,PERFECT,3
5,"As a fairly young female athlete with sleep apnea, I was set on finding a mask that was not too obtrusive, light on the face and did the job. This one is perfect! I have not had any problems with leaking, I think it's super comfortable (the medium worked out great and I have a pretty average sized face) and it has not really left any major marks on my face in the morning. It is lighter than some of the other masks I've tried and it is not so bulky that makes things more awkward than they have to be. I can easily read or watch TV before bed. And it's got the boyfriend approval! I can sleep through the night; this is the mask for me!",3
5,Deff my favorite !,3
5,This cream goes on clear and adjusts to your skins own color. It leaves a nice glow and makes your skin so soft. Love the spf20. This is a light coverage and natural looking cream.,3
5.0,I just love this Perfume....<br />The smell is the perfect scent for me.<br />Everyone I meet asks me where did you buy it & most of all...they love the scent & want it....,3
4,"This seller had just what I needed at a good price, plus the shipping was right on time. I will definitely look for this seller again on Amazon when I am ready to reorder. The only reason I didn`t  give the review 5 stars, is after all it is just a toothbrush.",3
5,This has been my favorite lip balm for several years.  It keeps my lips soft and moist.  I've also used it around my nose during a cold when my runny nose is chapped;; works great for that as well.,3
5,"Great dye, looks natural and makes you feel years younger.May have a strong smell at first, but peroxide will do that. Well worth the effort using this. I saved HUGE money buy using this in place of just for men dyes.",3
5,It actually seems to work. Love the smell.,3
5,"After wearing the product, I was immediately assimilated by the Borg! My fragrance and inscentivness has adapted to service perfection. I guess resistance is futile.",3
5,"I love this ponytail. It's easy to put in, and it looks real. The shipping was a lot faster than I had anticipated as well, it came about a week earlier than scheduled.",3
5,"not to strong, nice feminine scent that doesn't make those around you gag. Nice day or gym tote as well.",3
4,"nice colors, good texture, stays relatively well on the lips",3
5,"First let me say that I have normal skin that is very fair and nearly flawless to begin with, however, I'd like to keep it that way for as long as possible! I bought this product because I had received a sample in the mail and instantly loved it!! It absorbs so quickly and is so light and literally \\""refreshing\\""! Your skin feels amazing, it looks amazing and the light fragrance just seems to complete it. I got mine at Wal-Mart for under $7 I believe. I use this before going to bed and when I wake up I use it under the Moisture rescue lotion with SPF in it (which is also a great product). I hope this stuff stays with us for a very long time, but I'm stocking up just in case! Would ABSOLUTLEY recommend this to everyone!",3
5,"I just got the brown eyes set today and right out of the pot with the attached brush I got a really nice and crisp winged eye. I have shaky hands and I've never succeeded in a clean line before, so I'm really happy that this glides so easily without tugging my eyelids and that the brush is thin and sturdy enough to make a winged angle without any expertise on my part. Also wearing it for a couple hours now and it still looks great. Just mind yourself that the caps are twist tops even though they look like legos. ^-^;",3
5.0,"Great product, it really made a difference on my hair. I strongly recommend it.",3
5,"My daughter is a fan of the expensive, department-store eye shadow, and while I agree they are fine, I think the inexpensive L'Oreal brand is terrific.  It comes in great colors, blends well, and stays put all day.  Why pay so much more?",3
5,"I use other cleansers including soap with the brush, occasionally use the Olay scrub.  I never use any scrub above my eyes because the granules get in my eyes.",3
4,"Be advised that this is not a deodorant soap. After several weeks of use you will begin to accumulate an afternoon, ah, pungency.  Other than that one minor deficiency, I found this soap to be theraputic if you, like me, suffer from dry skin in the winter time.",3
5,Creamy consistency without being greasy! Never streaky or splotchy. I've been using this for years and I still LOVE it!,3
5,Love these. Much better than the ones I bought at Walgreens. The addition of spandex helps keep the gloves on at night.,3
5,"No alcohol!  How great is that!  It is so much better for one's hair.  If you squirt too much, it does give that sticky feeling.  I don't know any hairspray that doesn't, especially the pump kinds.  The smell is nice and not too strong.  I won't use anything else, and it goes great wiith the new L'Oreal Shampoos.",3
5.0,They look great and I received them in a timely manor :),3
5.0,great product!!,3
5,"Got this lotion about 2 years ago, it's super expensive and goes really quick so I started trying other lotions... Nothing compares. The smell is amazing, it sits well in the skin and keeps you moisturized all day, and I have no allergic reactions to it, as compared to other lotions. I'll probably be a Hemp Nation customer for life, as long as they keep the same formula. Don't waste your money on other lotions, nothing compares.",3
5,I love Arko's line of shave soaps and am glad to find the sensitive skin version at this price.  No matter where I search for products I always find them at Amazon at a better price and almost always free shipping.  Using Prime my stuff got here on the second day and in great shape.  No bar style shaving soap lathers up and does as good a job as this Arko in a tube.  One tube lasts me about one-and-a-half months shaving every other day.  I can re-lather twice for my typical 3-way shave using one application.  Always a great shave every time.  This is second only to Proraso Shave in a cup soap.,3
5,Well made and holds my hair; will be ordering more.,3
4.0,Slightly more drying than I expected considering my oily skin.,3
5,"Excellent product. It was exactly as advertised. The light floral scent is very feminine and flirty, and the roll on applicator is perfect for a purse.",3
5,"I enjoy how this cream feels on my skin. It seems a bit heavy at first but quickly absorbs & feels nourishing.  I've used it for a few years & even though I try something different every once in a while, I always return to this particular one as it's more 'clean/natural' than so many others I have tried.  No break-outs for me when I use Selene-E .<br />Highly recommend it.",3
5,"I first cleansed my face with Adovia's Dead Sea Salt Mineral Bar that you can also purchase on Amazon. I then wet my face and got a pinch full of salts and gently exfoliated my face and rinsed with water. Afterward my face felt smooth and looked remarkably brighter just as the product claimed. I have liked this exfoliating product more than any other I've tried before and that's saying something because I've tried SO many over the years that don't work or are too harsh.<br /><br />This product works even better with the rest of Adovia's product line. I was impressed by the size of the container of sea salts you get (2 month supply). I felt as though I could use as much as I needed without the need to skimp. Overall, I really enjoyed the salts and would purchase again.<br /><br />I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.",3
5,"Love love love these brushes! These are the best brushes I've ever used. Soft, affordable, and a lot of brushes for a great price. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a good set.",3
4,"Great product... handy for measuring nutrients for hydroponics solution.  Shipping is very slow compared to most other purchases made on Amazon, but don't give up...it will get there in about 10 days.",3
5,"My very sensitive skin adores this moisturizer.  Absolutely love it.  I currently use it at night, and use one with an spf during the day, but I'm always tempted to use it in the morning as well.  It makes my skin feels soft, plump, and happy.<br /><br />Cons: I wish I could give it 4.5 stars. The scent is the only downside - it's a little too strong, and smells like very sweet candy.  I've gotten used to it, so not a big deal, but when you first put it on it's hard not to think of smarties candy.",3
5,wonderful,3
4,"This product arrived in a pretty decent amount of time.  I havent been as pleased with it as I thought I would have been.  I have tried \\""paint it black\\"" a couple times and found that it worked pretty well.  I do like the way this product helps with my dry skin and it did help me acheive a more gradual tan vs a burn.  I have used other products in the past that seemed to work better though.  Overall I would reccomend this product but keep in mind different lotions work differently for different people...",3
5,I was very surprised and am very pleased with this Shower Gel.  I would certainly recommend it to others.  Has a nice fresh smell.,3
4,"Take this with a grain of salt, because I've been using the cheap $5 for 8 razor packs up to now. But man, what a difference. This thing completely smooths my face out. Whereas I used to get a 5 o'clock shadow by 11AM, now it actually doesn't appear... Until 5 o'clock! I got some razor burn going against the grain with it, but I have a pretty sensitive face to begin with, so I don't hold that against the razor. I've yet to find one that won't do that when I shave against the hair direction.",3
5,"Excellent,  excellent oroduct.  Gave as gift too many family and freiends.",3
5,"I love the Thymes Frasier Fir scent. I buy the lotion as well, but the candle is the original. I go through at least one every Christmas season.  It has the best scent!",3
5,This light is great. Cures in 30 secs or less. Priced well. Was cheaper online than at any of the beauty supplies near me.,3
5,"I was looking for something that would be easy to do in the mornings after nights when I'm too tired to prep my hair for styling the next day without a lot of heat.... I did a lot of research and decided to take a chance on this set after seeing so many stellar reviews. I was not disappointed at all! They are so versatile! I can do a quick bump of my ends with a few of the jumbo rollers in the mornings, or a regular roller set or roller wrap for more body... I've even given a chunky braidout a boost, by braiding at night and setting the ends of the braids with these in the morning, during the end of a particularly long and high maintenance stretch between relaxers.  And the heat is NOT damaging!! My hair actually feels MORE moisturized after I use these, EVERY TIME.  The results are so great my sister and mom have even started using my steam hairsetter.  The great part about it is that so many rollers of different sizes were in the set, and we all have different hair lengths, making it easy for all of us to have rollers in our hair at the same time if we need to.  And to those with african american hair that have complained of frizziness, I have found that lightly using a little coconut oil with my olive oil setting foam and end papers works wonders for preventing the frizz.  Also, I've found that different steam times for each size roller are much more effective, i.e. shorter steaming time (5 or 6 seconds) for small or petite rollers while longer (like 9 to 11 seconds) for jumbo rollers.  If you allow the roller to become soaked the drying process will become much longer, and you increase the risk for frizz.  If you're looking for something that's quick and don't mind a styling method that will actually condition your hair at the same time, I think this steamer is the way to go.<br /><br />By the way, I VERY RARELY review anything... ever...but I felt the world should know about this since, apparently, I was super late :)<br /><br />Have fun with your steam hairsetters guys!!!",3
4,"This product is the alternative to me of Rubywoo from mac.. I love Rubywoo from mac but sometimes it can leave your lips feeling pretty dry, so when i need something like rubywoo to wear, but my lips cant take it, I switch over to this one.. you get a very similar color but with much more moisture.",3
5,I put mine in the fridge before using it to get that cooling sensation. My skin felt refreshed and extremely soft! Would definitely recommend it!,3
4,"This replaced my original, which I had damaged, and it functions perfectly.  Same size, color and fit as the original. No sign of wear or damage to indicate that this replacement was itself not a new part. This is, apparently, an actual Norelco part from a shaver that has been &#34;parted out.' It is not an imitation made in some far eastern country where the goal is to make something that looks like the desired product.  If I need another part in the future, I will happily purchase from this company again.",3
5,"I don't use too much eyeliner but I do apply black on the outer edge of my top lid and this stuff stayed all day long! I was impressed, especially for such a rich black.",3
5,"Just got this in the mail today! It smells amazing, and I really like the texture of the lotion (nice and smooth) Definitely recommend thi product to any one- Zomorah",3
5,"I have tried numerous products, more expensive but always come back to this product. It is hot so for more experienced tanners. You will result in redness and sensative skin for a couple hours, but this works. I love it.",3
4,"I know that everyone's skin is different and a lot of things come into play with razor burn and such (if you shave when you first get in the shower, the type of shaver, how new the blades are, the cream) but I will say that I really like this cream.  I've used a lot of gels (aveeno, skintimate, gilette) and the only one that never gave me issues before was the skintimate cream but It left me feeling really dry though and I prefer products not tested on animals.  So I tried this one and it's nice.  It is a little thick, but I just wet my legs first and smooth it on lightly.  I feel like it protects my skin and leaves me feeling super smooth in all the places I shave with no razor burns.  My partner asked me how I get my bikini so smooth without waxing and I know it's this product.  It does get really thick at the bottom of the bottle when there is still plenty in there so I just added some water to it and shook it up a little.  It still stayed thick enough to use and let me get the rest out of the bottle.  I definitely think it's worth the price and the smell is just amazing.",3
4,"I chose this product because I have been in search of something that would help smooth my wrinkles and improve my overall skin tone and, for the most part,  it has DELIVERED and I intend to continue using this serum.",3
4,I brought this product for my senior prom and i want my teeth to be all whiter!! i like product because my teeth went up and lighter shade. i think because it was my first time I didn't the full affect. i happy i didn't experience any sensitive which is a plus,3
5,Best Keratin treatment I have tried so far... I have tried many and I am curly type 3c...this product left my hair looking amazing.. would totally buy it again!,3
5,"I really like this curling iron. It heats up fast, is very comfortable to use and stays hot under heavy use. It's a keeper for sure.",3
4.0,So cute wish they were smaller in size,3
5,I saw this curler of Real Housewives of NJ and I LOVE the curl that I get for this curler. It gets really hot which I like and my curl last all night. It's a great curler if you like big wavy type curls.,3
5,"I now have 6 of these, they work so well for my very fine uncooperative hair.  They really do stay in, and keep the hair in place.  And look good.",3
4,I bought this for a friend for Christmas and she really liked it. I think Avon products are a good value and work as well as other top brands. It is also nice that I did have to call a representative to get this product. I am glad that amazon sells Avon products because I only need a few things and I don’t want to be bothered by phone calls from a rep. every month.,3
5,"Finally I have found my staple skin care product! I am a Black female with a dark complexion and I have suffered from hyperpigmentation and oily skin.  I have tried every product on the market twice and nothing compares to this soap.  Literally after one use I saw a difference in my skin.  I've been using this product for about a month now and I'm still impressed.  My skin is not 100% clear YET and the dark spots are much lighter now. I use this soap twice a day and use a light moisturizer afterwards.  FYI; This soap is potent and if you use a lot of soap it will dry your skin out too much.  Less is more with this soap when dealing with sensative facial skin.  I just use a LIGHT lather and work it into my face and rinse.  Again, this soap is potent and I would rinse off immediately after gently washing my face.  Don't let it stay on your face for longer than 1min if that!  One last tip-this soap can become messy when wet, and storage in the shower can be a headache. I've found that it's best to dissolve the soap in purified water and use it like a body wash. I just estimated on the soap to water ratio.  You will be able to tell if you need more or less soap/water by how the mixture lathers up.      This product has dramatically changed the way my skin looks and feels, and I highly recommend that anyone with skin problems give it a try.",3
5,"My 10 yr old has the most difficult hair to brush.  I am amazed at how this brush works!!!  This is the best brush for anyone who has a child that has a tender head with lots of tangles!!!!  My child is a swimmer, and keeps this in her swim bag.  I would recommend this brush to anyone that has a difficult time brushing out tangles!!!!!!",3
5,I like this product since I get no eye irritation when I sweat a lot.,3
5,I was so tired of watered down soaps with weak scents!  Expensive but worth it as one uses very little to get a good lather going and the sandalwood fragrance is accurate and very attractive without being overpowering.,3
5.0,My mature skin definitely appreciates this moisturizer. It needs very little of this light cream yet feels soft and moist after every application. I also love that it is so easy to apply.,3
4,"These stay on pretty well when my nail lady put them on, they are pretty big for nails if you don't have acrylic or gels I wouldn't recommend them, although the colors are great and they really stand out!",3
5,"The shampoo is perfect for my kids hair, leaving only a hint of chlorine smell after washing.  Conditioner helps calm the hair and not make it feel like hay!  I have dry, colored hair and the conditioner is not the greatest for me so i tend to use the shampoo and then a different hydrating conditioner instead.  As others have said, it is runny so it comes out fast.  If your children are younger, I would apply for them.",3
4,"I'm a newbie at nail art, but was getting more adventurous, so decided to invest in some brushes. I already own a set of MASH stamping plates, and they're awesome, so I figured their  brushes would be too. The price is unbeatable, for the number of brushes you get. The shipping was super fast (oh wait, I think it was Prime Eligible...). I've used them a few times now, and am slowly learning which brush does what.<br />In fact, I'd say the only thing missing really, is a little instruction sheet, with ideas of what to do, and the brushes to use. And they clean beautifully in acetone, but only pure acetone - anything else does not clean them properly.",3
5,Keep in mind it will smell strong when you first put it on.  Let it settle and you will most definitely smell how great Love Rocks is!!! Will buy again!!!,3
5,Very fast shipping and it smells great! Very peachy! I may have to order another one soon!,3
5,I bought this as a gift for my bffs 18th bday. INCREDIBLE colors! gorgeous! great case. NONE of the them came broken or spilling from the pots. Packaging was safe and protected well especialy where they shipped from the east coast to Utah (west)<br />great product! GREAT SHADOWS. will totally buy one for myself too ^_^,3
5.0,"I purchased this item too, it makes my nails look healthy. I've always had a problem with my nails not growing and once they due grow,they break because they are so soft. This product,I will swear by. I will continue to use.",3
5,"All the comments are correct, and there is a reason why its a best seller. Works like a charm. My favorite part is the built in squegee which lets you wipe the surface of droplets.",3
5,"I love this perfume and they only sell it once a year at Victoria Secret, I am so happy I found this online :) and cheaper",3
5,Excellent,3
5,"Originally I got this shaving gel for my husband.  He raved about it so much that I just had to give it a try.  I used it on my legs and it worked beautifully.  My legs came out smooth and soft and I didn't smell like a boy because it has a crisp, clean scent.  Highly recommended for both guys and ladies!",3
5,"I've been using Braun shavers for 30 years, but the last one was no good.  Didn't keep it's charge at all (would sag after 2 minutes of use on a fully charged battery) and the pop up hair trimmer broke after 4 months.  So, I decided to try this one.  What a difference!  Ten times better than the more expensive Braun. It is really light, the head pivots nicely and the shave is very close for an electric shaver.  Love it!",3
5.0,"Love this product :) Smell so good but yet is not over powering, and leave my hair silky soft.",3
5,"I don't like perfumes or fragrances so I've been buying this clean, fresh smelling body wash for a couple of years. As with most things I fall in love with, it got discontinued so buy it while you can.",3
5,Excellent product and service love it best curler ever,3
5,love,3
5.0,"This is a great shampoo! It worked well on my relaxed hair that I wear curly.  It helped my hair in all areas. My hair is very dry, and tangles very easily. This shampoo did a good job on my hair.  I did what it promised it was very moisturizing and left my hair and scalp clean and my hair was  tangle free. I wish I had tried the conditioner along with the shampoo.  The shampoo really impressed me. I had heard about it and how good it is for Afro-American hair.  It did not disappoint me.  We have well water and this shampoo did a great job on my hair despite the hard water we have.  I cannot wait to try the other products in this line.  Now that I know it works so well I will have to try to find it at my local beauty supply store hopefully in a bigger bottle.  I had a smaller bottle.  This shampoo gave my hair a nice slip while I was styling my hair.  I cannot say enough good things about this shampoo.  I wish I had tried it a lot sooner.",3
5,Perfect!,3
5,Lov the product works good been using it for about a year would recommend this product to anyone to use.,3
4,"The shaver works well.  It gives a decent shave.  The batteries last up to two weeks, depending on how long an individual takes to shave.  It is light=weight, and comfortable to hold.  It comes with a cleaning brush that is very small.  It does not come with a carrying case.",3
4,"This scale is very easy to use,<br />but I had trouble after charging<br />the batteries. Several people<br />tried to help me get it going<br />again. Be warned that when you<br />take the batteries out to recharge<br />them make notes about how they<br />should be placed.",3
5,Super sharp and effective.,3
4,"comes with every basic thing you need.  the soap has a nice, light scent and doesn't dry out the skin.  bought this for my boyfriend for our anniversary and he loves it",3
5,"Going on 3 years now, if it ever breaks I want one just like it.",3
5,Love this stuff!!! I use it daily in the morning and at night. I get so many compliments on my skin!,3
5,"I've had bad dandruff and scalp infections due to it this stuff actually got rid of it completely, not sure if it works for everyone but it's definitely worth a try because of the long lasting effect it has, will definitely buy more when my 1st order is finished. Tip cut hair as low as possible before use apply cream to scalp leave for an hour or so then rinse off with shampoo, this method worked for me",3
5,"What an amazing deal.  These are the exact same copper tongue cleaners I purchased JUST ONE unit of (http://www.amazon.com/Tongue-Scraper-Ayurvedic-Antimicrobial-Cleaner/dp/B00P6RAVEW/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1430721975&sr=8-2&keywords=copper+tongue+cleaner) for $10.25; THESE are 12 in package and in comparing the scraper I received from Diamond Dental System they are identical.  Give to your loved ones as gifts, keep on hand, whatever...just a better deal.  I see and notice and feel absolutely NO difference between these and the more-expensive one.",3
5,"I had cataract surgery this year and I cannot live without this product.  It is extremely clear and accurate--I see all of my flaws.  I already had one, but my movers didn't deliver it with the bulb intact so I promptly ordered another one.",3
5,"they are simply amazing!! so useful, I love them!",3
5,Excellent price and postage! Will buy again.,3
4,"Overall, this is a good mascara. The brush is not low-quality, and you don't need several applications to see the result. It does smudge a bit if you wear it all day long but, on the positive side, this mascara is very easy to remove. Definitely a product to consider if you are on a tighter budget.",3
5,I recommend this curler to every girl that wants to have beautiful curly hair I just got it and I love it works great totally recommend it is not like the other ones this heats to 460*F in less than 10 sec you have a curl I'm so happy I choose this one,3
5,Comprei essas tocas e me surpreendi ao usa-las.<br />Se soubesse que eram tão práticas já teria comprado há mais tempo.<br />Recomendo.,3
4,this is a quality cream. but TOO MUCH GLIDE for me personally.,3
5,Excellent price on a great product that is almost impossible to find in stores. Great shaves at an excellent price,3
4,"This stuff is totally cool, and it definitely mattifies and sets makeup.  The tough part is that it's so fine, it won't even stay on my brush.  It's literally like brushing smoke onto your face and hoping it stays.  I recommend tapping on with a finger.",3
5,I have a Microfiber comforter that when I washed it it got a ton of little fuzz balls all over it. I bought this and now all the fuzz is gone and my comforter is back to perfect again.,3
5,very nice set i love them beautition will too,3
4,"I used this after having a dental procedure and it really helped. It also made my teeth appear whiter! I think it's overpriced, that's the only negative.",3
5.0,"I have used many types over the years, consider myself at a professional level. Deb L's polishes rate the very highest. Other than using a cured gel manicure, you can't get better than this! This particular color is a dreamy deep reddish burgundy. Very nice!",3
5,Perfect.,3
4,The bottles are nice and exactly what I expected the package arrived all torn up but it's just a box I was very happy with this purchase.,3
5,"Love, but costly.",3
5,love the brush had it for a long time now,3
5,"The 'perfume' is light and fresh - so you don't feel like your hair announces, 'I didn't get washed today.'  My daughter borrowed my new can for her vacation ...  I never got it back.  Enough said.",3
5.0,"Good product, non stinging. Works really well and doesnt hurt your eyes which is always an issue for me. Reasonalbe price :)",3
5,"The tattoo shop I went to gives this out when you get a tattoo, they also sell it too. It is great for new and old tattoos to preserve color and take care of scabs and pores. Wouldn't trade this stuff for another brand. Would highly recommend this to someone who needs a cream or gel for their tattoo.",3
5,"I would give 6 starts if there was an option, wife love it and would use it all of the time if she could!!  Just purchased another bottle today for her.",3
4,It was smaller than I expected- but it is a cute little bottle.,3
5,"I really like this electric tooth brush.  For the price, it's great until I decide to get a chargeable one.",3
5,"I love applying foundation with a synthetic brush as it gives me such an amazing flawless result. I bought myself tons of such brushes from Sigma and i adore the Round Kabuki F82 as well as the Angled Kabuki F84 the most. But since i received my new Real Techniques Expert Face Brush, i find myself reaching for it often. This brush is just perfect in size and shape. It is short and so dense and a bit flat compare to the F82 from Sigma, making foundation application much easier for me. I use this with bronzer to contour, to apply cream blush and highlighting too. For the price, the quality of this brush is absolutely amazing it is comparable to high end brushes.",3
5,"It works really well and the smell is tolerable. So many fragrances associated with hair products are just awful, but this one is fine. Will certainly buy it again.",3
5.0,"Only giving the 4 stars because I have yet to use all the brushes. BUT, I do love the kabuki brush. I have used it every day for my foundation and it has yet to drop a single hair! It cleans up beautifully, time and again. I have used it with Estee Lauder dbl wear and the max coverage, flawless.<br />*update<br />All the brushes are amazing, the kabuki is still awesome. Have yet to drop any hair after several months of everyday use.",3
5,"I don't exactly know about the whole line and I haven't purchased the set but at my local store they have the Tweety hand soap and my daughter loves it! I got it for my daughter because she loves washing her hands and she will be starting potty training soon so I wanted to get her some kid friendly, fun hand wash and for a $1 I thought why not. Well it exceeds my expectations! It is easy to dispense, stays on the hands, smells great, and I really feel that my daughters hands are getting clean. I even use it occasionally :) If the 2 in 1 smells and is anything like the handsoap then I will be purchasing this in the future.",3
5,works great. one of the better masks. leave your skin feeling new. i like the earthy smell but it does take some getting used to,3
5,Love this pallette!,3
5,I must have received a &#34;dud&#34; in the last unit I bought.<br />Things like the on/off switch would not work properly but the warranty had just lapsed.<br />This one is great.<br />RECOMMEND<br /><br />John,3
5,I find this brush perfect for applying cream blush.  A light tapping of the brush applies just enough of the product for light coverage.,3
5.0,Awesome Price... Beautifully  A Light Floral Fragrance,3
5,"I bought this after receiving a recommendation to do so from the book Gourmet Shaving and I have been very happy with it.  This works great for sealing nics from wet shaving.  I've also used it to seal small cuts on my hands/fingers.  It barely takes any effort at all to roll it over the cut and the bleeding stops instantly.<br /><br />I think one tube is going to last me a long time as well so it really is a great value.  Great purchase, I highly recommended picking one up!",3
4,I tried the normal Model in a Bottle and noticed it stung a little on my face so I wanted to give this Sensitive Solution a try.  Same lasting formula but without the stinginess from the original! will definitely repurchase.,3
5,"These glasses are of a superior construction and design. I bought 3 pair and messed one up when I tried to bend them for a minimal adjustment. Just be careful when bending them at the hinge area, which was my fault. I am totally satisfied with them especially their optical quality of them being of the aspheric optical material.",3
4,IT is a good product. needs constant attention while shaving.  Recommend,3
5,They do what they are suppose to do,3
4,I was a little skeptical ordering this perfume from Amazon because you just never know what you'll get..<br />You'll either love it or hate it.<br />It truly is a beautiful scent! It's not overpowering...it's very soft & sensual.,3
4,This is a pretty good mirror considering the price.  I bought it as a replacement for my ten year old Conair mirror that was broken by my cat.  My only complaint is the Jerdon is not as magnified as my previous mirror but the lighting is much better. I have to admit I was hesitant to purchase this after reading previous reviews about the lights making the mirror too hot to use.  It's been fine for me and I've found it doesn't get too hot.  Not a bad product for the price. I would definitely recommend....,3
5,This was perfect for what I wanted. Sometimes combination soap/shampoo aren't great on your hair but I am very happy with this one. I wanted to carry less when I travel so I opted for a combination and this one smells great. It is not very concentrated and does not suds up as much as normal soap/shampoo but I think that's because it's a gentler soap.,3
5,"I started using the original serum 14 years ago and fell in love.  I switched to this Thermal Protection formula a couple years ago because I was blow-drying and flat-ironing my hair on a regular basis.  The John Frieda line has always impressed me, and this product was no different.<br /><br />This is not as thick or \\""powerful\\"" as the extra-strength formula, so if you have very dry or coarse hair, you should try that one, and use something separate to protect from heat-styling.  But for normal-dry hair, even processed (my hair is dyed), it's just fine.  I have long hair - usually 4-6 inches past my shoulders.  I divide my hair into two sections, and squirt a little less than a quarter sized amount of serum in my palm for each section, working it through my hair (especially the ends).  Then I do my hair.  When I forget to use this before blowing out my hair, the difference is enormous - it's puffy, frizzy, and tangles easily.  With the serum, it's smooth, glassy, and well-behaved. I often get compliments on my hair - from stylists!<br /><br />One thing to remember: the \\""dime-sized\\"" amount the bottle says to use - that's for men, I think.  No way is that enough for thick or long hair.  It took me a few tries to figure out how much I needed for my hair.  But this is a great tool to have in your hair-styling arsenal.",3
4,I love the smell of this antiperspirant and deo. it just brought out the best from my husband. and now he's handsome and appealing as ever. not surpised as to how he got admirers at the office,3
5,This is the smartest purchase I have made in years.  Frees up my hands to apply make-up with accuracy so I don't look like a raggedy anne doll.  Shipped fast with great packing.  Mirror arrived perfectly.,3
5.0,great,3
5,I expected a no name make up brand but was pleasantly surprised when I saw that I received M.A.C. Makeup,3
5,It cleans the tongue very good and the brush was designed excellently because you can reach the back of your tongue easily. Thanks.,3
5,"I chanced upon this amazing series of reviews because I am housebound for awhile and have to order online.<br /><br />I am not a shill for Crest.  I don't use their toothpaste and I doubt they care much about their customers as long as stuff still sells.<br /><br />That said, there is NO other OTC mouthwash better than this.  The only other mouthwash that is not a joke is Listerine, but it does NOT offer the anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis features of Pro-health.<br /><br />If you are younger (below 40), I would say use whatever.  But it is the CPC in Pro-health that provides the anti-gingivitis protection that is CRUCIAL if you want to keep your teeth into old age.  The CPC is apparently what causes the browning in SOME people.<br /><br />I have had no browning or tastebud issues whatsoever after years of use.<br /><br />My advice:  buy a small bottle at the drugstore.  If browning develops, stop of course.  A routine teeth-cleaning will remove it.  You don't need a full-blown whitening.  Ask Crest for reimbursement, sue them, whatever.  But smart people just stop using products that don't work for them.  Not every product works for everyone.  This works for me.  And there is no effective OTC equivalent.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.",3
4,"Although I like this tiny - tiny - glass dish, those of you looking for a cheaper dappen dish for brushes to use with acrylics and monomer should look elsewhere - preferably one that tells you the dimensions. Now, I don't use acrylics, and haven't gotten into gels either, but this seems way too small for a monomer liquid. As soon as the brush would be dipped into the liquid, it would spill over the sides. Perhaps there are some people who do use this for that very purpose, but I honestly don't see how.<br /><br />Anyway, for my usage - which is simply to tip some nail polish remover into it for an easy clean up for whatever I'm doing - it's perfectly fine. For a dollar and some change, I can't complain. It's exactly what I needed. Has decent weight to it despite it being small, so I don't think it'll be sliding around. I just wanted something glass to put remover into so I don't distort the plastic lid to the bottle, as well as something I can clean my brushes and dotting tools in quickly so I don't ruin nail designs.",3
5,Keeps the red razor rash away....I have been using it for years and hate it when I run out so I always keep a spare.,3
5,I bought the Oral-b Profession Healthy Rechargeable electric toothbrush but I was concerned about the brush that came with<br /><br />it.  I have &#34;fragile&#34; teeth and the soft brushes are really very helpful.,3
5,"all came to my entire satisfaction, I can recommend widely to make their purchases hereby, all my products came to my entire satisfaction",3
5,"I'm a curly haired natural and needed a good moisturizing deep conditioner. I found it in this product! It leaves my hair feeling hydrated and smelling good. I bought the 3-pack just in case I really loved it and if it didn't work, I would have given the others away. Such a good decision because I'm on the second one already. I wish there was a gigantic container lol",3
5,My nail polish stays on a week longer than usual I love it! If you are debating about buying this product you should definitely get it here because the price is cheaper than in the stores (actually it's sold out a lot of the time in stores).,3
5,"products i purchased come , and i love it. the condition is great also. this seller pack the products we purchased so carefully, and i find no broken things inside the package. i am not using the polishes yet, but i am sure this polishes in a great condition. recommended seller!",3
5.0,"Excellent brushes! They are generously sized, dense and extremely soft. I prefer face brushes without long handles. I have always been a fan of kabuki brushes. These seem very high quality and they feel sturdy. I have already washed them once, washing has not altered them, nor have I seen any fallout.",3
5,I absolutely adore this lotion! It works as promised and I've seen a huge difference in color after a few uses in an instant bed. It smells amazing and I've struggled with cellulite and I've actually seen an improvement after using this lotion. I always hated washing my hands before getting into the bed with other lotions but with this one I don't even have to worry about orange hands! It's more than worth the price you pay.,3
5,always order this....love it<br />hope the price stays the same<br />it lasts a long time and travels well...will keep buying.,3
4,Love the Spikenard! The only problem was that 1/2 of the perfume had leaked into the Styrofoam. The half left smelled so wonderful!,3
5,Estee Lauder has been my go to product works well on my face leaves it feeling very clean and leaves a little glow works great for my skin.,3
5,"I have natural body, but this gives me lots of beautiful bouncy curls!!<br />Smells great & leaves hair soft while holding style",3
5,excellent!,3
4,"After using the flosser, I find that it cleans the gunk from between my teeth very well and massages my gums. The only thing I don't like is how the water gets all over my hand when using it. Also, there's no gum bleeding like when I used a thread flosser. Maybe Waterpik can design a new flosser that angles the handle and/or tool so that the water doesn't go all over your hand? Maybe extending the tool further from the handle would help too? Or just maybe I'm incorrectly holding it?",3
5.0,Excellent my hair look silky softy and very shine,3
5,"I'm a Denver Bronco superfan and have tried all the semi-permanent dyes. This one is thin instead of thick as most of the others are; it doesn't stain the skin, doesn't smell bad and lasts MUCH longer than those of other mfrs. I just ordered 6 more! Need it for Super Bowl week, you know.",3
5,"I've been using the product now for over a month and I have used it for working out and playing percussion drums. that's active. No odor. It doesn't stop the sweat and I wasn't expecting it to. If you're a naturally heavy sweater, this won't work for sweat control, but for odor, give it a try.",3
5,"I bought this razor and was not super fond of it, till I discovered the problem. Dorco, the manufacturer of the DE razors that are used in the kit are not sharp enough for my chin whiskers. So I went to a local store and bought new blades. The shave was awesome after replacing the stock blades.<br />My father taught me how to use safety razors as a kid. I loved safety razors for years and have missed them on super market shelves. This razor is well balanced, it has a sleek feel and is constructed well. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Also I would recommend that you read the instructions before use and follow them, or else it could be a bloody experience. Also look at youtube or check out the art of manliness prior to using a safety razor. These are not your typical 21st century shave. If you have no technique behind the blade it is not a good shave at all.<br />The other factor  that is involved with how good of a shave do you want involves prep time, and shave lotion. I would suggest any of the Burt's Bees Shaving products. Also experiment with hot and cold water shaves. The cold water shave leaves less of a razor burn, and ice also stops any irritation, versus the hot water shave is relaxing, but can leave you with rash or razor burn.<br />This razor is a great buy, and most of the reviews I have seen that are negative sound like people who did not use proper technique and punished themselves with cuts!<br />I cannot say anything but positive remarks about this razor and hope to see a come back of DE razors!",3
5,I order from here before and like the nasal cushion so why not again it a good product . Also I got it when promise . I will tell my sister about and my friends that need one . I will order again,3
4,"Hip Peas is a great detangler.  It has a wonderful smell of blueberries, and does the trick for nasty tangles.  The downside is it is a bit on the expensive side, and if you use a bit too much will leave a greasy look.  I am very happy with this product, have been purchasing for about a year.  One bottle last approximately 3-4 months for two girls with shoulder length hair.",3
5,"I've used this lipstick for years and there is nothing as good as this for moisturizing and giving your lips a lovely shine.  Just keep on makin it, Revlon!",3
5,"My daughter used these while she had braces and now that she has permanent retainers.  She refuses to use any other type of floss product.  Only wish they were cheaper, but hey, she's doing a great job flossing and has beautiful teeth!",3
5,I don't think I ever finished a hairspray in my life until I found this one. Best hairspray ever.<br />Great product!,3
5,"It's a perfect cream for feet, it really works if you use it on a regular basis. I'd recommend it to anyone who has dry feet. I used other creams including famous brands but this one did save my feet from dryness.",3
5,"Just got this in the mail today, the bottle is small. I got this because I heard it works well for itchy tummys. It smells really good like fresh lemon and it's not as oily as other products which I love. I'm not sure if it works for stretch marks but I am also using this product with mama bee belly butter.",3
5,I love this product and I have done research to get outside reviews.  It is so smooth and feels like it's working when I apply it. It truly nourishes the skin and I will continue to buy it long term.,3
4.0,"great odor, last long.",3
5.0,"great product, no shipping issues",3
5,I love this stuff! I have used it off and on for years. It smells great and it leaves my hair soft and manageable. I have permed and color treated hair now and this is the only thing I put in my hair. It keeps the frizz down without any &#34;crunchy&#34; side affect.,3
5,Great stuff,3
5,I have tried the Gillette Fusion for a few days now and WOW. You only need one pass to get a close shave and it does not pull at your skin especially at the neck line. I was using cheap razors that you would have to keep going over the same spot and would pull at the neck line a lot. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.,3
5,"I received a free sample of this from bzzagent.com and i am absolutely in love with it! I would recommend this product 100%. I noticed a change in my hair after the first use. Not only is it in the coolest bottle ever, but it is quick and easy to use and it really works. My hair is very damaged and dry from constant use of blow dryers, straighteners and curling irons. This is the first product that has been able to add moisture without making my thin hair look greasy. It also smells great! Buy it!",3
5,Great product and seller,3
5,"This performs as expected, Small enough for travel. Always been a fan of this brand. one two three four five.",3
5,"I decided to order this for my boyfriend for Christmas, and after reading Justin's review I immediately called Norelco to order the Contour Comb from the QT 4050 so I could include it with the gift.  They were very helpful and ordered the part for me with no problems!  I did not have to speak to a supervisor as some others have had to do, and the whole process took about 5 minutes.  The girl said they have had tons of calls for this, so she knew exactly what part I was talking about.  For all info on part numbers and phone numbers, see Justin Tentil's review below!",3
4,I ah e a clean......,3
5,"This is an awesome product, which provides easy to apply, mistake-proof, lightweight, natural illuminating coverage!  I simply love it!",3
5,I have very dark circles under my eyes due to thyroid and other issues and that combined with my age it is hard to find something that both hides and doesn't cake or get into the wrinkles.  You have to layer this a bit as it is very light but it does work.,3
5,"I especially love the cord on this product.  It is a soft, rubbery material so it does not tangle as much as other curling irons.  The multiple heat settings are great.",3
5,I have used this product before on my son who had a severe cut on his hand but refused to go to the hospital. He tried over the counter products but his hand was looking really bad. I bought this put it on the infected area that morning that night the redness was already going away. This product is FANTASTIC!,3
5,"Reading these reviews, I have to wonder if the manufacturer made improvements to the suction cups over the years. I've had no problem. As otherwise promised, it is quiet, powerful, and really does turn my tub into a spa. The power cord is plenty long enough. One thing they don't warn you about is the &#34;fill level&#34; -- it doesn't account for the increase in volume when you get into the tub! So keep that in mind. But overall, I recommend this product. As another reviewer said, you can either buy a $2000 home spa, or you can buy this handy little gadget. It gets the job done almost as well.",3
5,"Pretty much the best Beard Trimmer you can buy. The Vacuum isn't perfect but gets up most of the hair, making clean up easier. And the LED display is a real plus especially for knowing when you need to charge it. I can be forgetful so I also like that it works while plugged in. Does great on general shaving, not so much on edging up however.",3
5,Another fine product from the Cosmedix skin care line.,3
5,"I feel this is a great product and I purchased it at a great price. Would definitely recommend to others, very happy purchase.",3
5,"Received this product super fast. I have used SEA breeze for my hair and my face for many years!  I just wish they sold SEA Breeze Sensitive in larger quantities (i.e., by the gallon).",3
4,"The shaver works smoothly and the self-cleaning function works great for a lazy dude like me.  The cleaner refills run out quickly, though, creating a minor drain on the monthly budget.",3
5.0,"I was looking for something to easily remove glitter nail polish which as you know if very difficult to remove....this stuff was amazing. It took off every bit of the glitter polish...nothing left stuck to my nails. It makes super quick work of regular polish and I only end up using 1 cotton ball per hand. It does dry out your cuticles a bit, but I only use it once a week and keep cuticle oil on hand to re-hydrate them.  I will never go back to regular polish remover. This is the best!!",3
5,OUTSTANDING product.  More effective than any other deodorant.<br />Drugs are now applied to underarms for absorbtion into the body.....check out what is in deodorants and see if you want them inside you.,3
5,"Great multitasking brush! Both sides are durable/washable. The brush side is very dense yet thin, making application awesome. Whether blending a pencil, powder, or gel this is great brush for under $10!",3
5,I am very happy with these hair towels.  The colors I received were very pretty.  They are super absorbant and stay in place until you are ready to style your hair.  The price was good.,3
5,"This is the original Q-tip. Its stem is made out of rolled paper, it is pretty stiff (not bendy<br />like plastic Q-tips) and it does not splinter (like wooden stem Q-tips).  It has a good<br />amount of 100% cotton on its tip.  Some Q-tips are not as tightly woven around the<br />end as others, but I usually just twirl it between my finger tips to get a tighter tip<br />if needed.<br /><br />I use it for applying ointment to  my dry nose, and even though you are not supposed to<br />occasionally for clearing the ears for ear wax. They also work well for clearing<br />out fabric dust from the inside of the sewing machine. I've also used it on the inside<br />of electronic and computer equipment, when nothing else is small enough to reach the dust.<br /><br />This packaging is a cost effective solution and will last a long time!",3
4,"Flimsy, but they fit in my furnace, and I'm satisfied with the price.  I can't verify the MERV value, and I haven't noticed a reduction in dust around the house, but they serve their purpose. Installed for over a month now.",3
5,"Wonderful product.  Makes shaving of my legs painless, and I don't break out which I do when I just shave with soap.",3
5,Cost-effective and works wonderfully.,3
4.0,Works well and great for travel -  compact and top locks.,3
5,"Arrived right on time, very well protected with the packaging.  Works like a charm! (A bit scary, to see oneself that closely, but that's what I wanted!)",3
5,"Gift for my daughter, she loved it.",3
4,I really like the product but the top does not sit right so it is difficult to dispense....the ones I bought at the pharmacy were fine....,3
5,I use this every day and have loved it since! The smell isnot too strong and great for daytime or nighttime.,3
4,"Takes about 2 months to really notice difference, but patience it the key with this product.",3
4,"I bought this pack because I have terribly dry lips, and I lick them which in turn makes them way worse. Terrible, horrible bacon lips. I've gotten better about using chapstick but every now and then I get behind and this is the kind of boost I needed.<br /><br />They work pretty well, definitely helps scrub off some of that skin that is pestering you so you can start fresh. It does taste good, so don't go eating it or it won't last very long. It goes pretty fast, being grains of sugar and a light something to hold it all together, you can burn through it if you use it a lot or push hard.<br /><br />ALSO, do not leave this stuff anywhere remotely warm. I left one in my car the first few days I was using it and it all melted into the cap and became unusable. Very sad about that.",3
4.0,"Okay, for one, THIS IS A TINGLE. Only when your skin is turning red is this lotion doing what it's supposed to. I don't tan with anything other than tingles. I like the burning sensation. Two, don't buy a tingle lotion and complain about your skin TINGLING. That isn't a review, that is an uneducated tanner showing the world how uneducated they are about tanning lotions.<br /><br />For the lotion part of the review: for me, very few tingles continue to tingle after the first couple of uses. This one does. There aren't any bronzes in it so my skin hasn't turned any orange tints I don't want. The redness lasts for about an hour afterwards. The scent is great, not to strong. I don't smell burnt when I get out of the tanning bed. It applies very smoothly as this lotion is a little thinner than others. Will buy again",3
5,My daughter is using this and can tell already that her nails are growing. Thank you!,3
4,"I am not one to indulge the &#34;IT&#34;S GREAT&#34; reviews, because they don't really give you a realistic expectation. This is the first badger hair brush I have used, and I like it so far. This combined with the soap I use have led to much less irritation when I shave which is a win in my book.",3
5.0,"Bought 2 of these, my son's works fine, mine slowed down right out of package. Thought batt. was low, charged and still nothing. Used Son's charger, realized unit is locked up. Need to send it back for warranty as trash is already gone w/ package. UPDATE Oral B stands behind their product. Went to dentist to get routine cleaning, dentist asked if I stopped smoking, no I said, got a new toothbrush. She was stunned, said my gums look healthier too. Funny, she recommends the over $100 models. Highly recommed!",3
5,Love this product.  I am so glad I found it - I cannot tell the difference between this and the &#34;big name&#34; C serums.  My 50+ skin loves it,3
5,Love it!!!!! Face was smoother and it dries acne flare up in 2 days.  I will never be without my glam glow!,3
5,"I LOVE this flat iron. i was looking around for a CHI, but i saw too many imitations and bad reviews, so when i stumbled on this one and saw all the fantastic reviews i thought i would give it a shot. It showed up at my door 5 mins. ago and i tried it out right away. I have never been SO excited about a flat iron in my life. My hair is big, thick, half-wavy, half-curly, and a pain in the butt to straighten. I normally have to go over each 1 inch piece of hair at least 3 times to get it to be flat, and when i used the HSI today, it went over once and made my hair so flat and so incredibly shiny and healthy looking. I did not use any product, the flat iron did it on its on. Don't buy anything else, for 50 bucks, its the best purchase i ever made on amazon.",3
5.0,Awesome,3
5,Nice fine bit to softly refine nails.,3
5,My favorite eye liner ever! This stuff is it. I won't ever use any other. It stays on forever and it's so black. I have tried so many other name brand eyeliners this is the blackest one I have ever found. I won't ever go back!,3

5,"I have shaved exclusively with electric shavers my entire adult life.  A bit of a ritual, but I always buy the new top of the line Norelco as soon as it becomes available. I currently have the 9195XL and the James Bond Spectra shavers.  I pre-ordered this on Amazon and was anxious to get it as it clearly is a major departure from Norelco's typical styling.  It arrived completely dead which I thought a bit odd, but charging it was the another first.  No cord plugs into the bottom, it has two small round electrical contacts the size of ball bearings, one on each side.  It charges in its stand or the travel case, a nice touch.  The new head arrangement pivots FAR more than any prior model and it really hugs the contours of your face and neck.  It is relatively quiet, shaves VERY fast and very close with no irritation.  It is also extremely easy to clean.  Each cutter/comb assembly hinges up, but remains attached to the head making it very easy to rinse out without worrying about the cutters and combs separating from one another.  Since the whole head assembly must be replaced to get new cutters, I suspect that part will command a premium. The protective head guard will not come off until you physically remove it, another Norelco first.    Negatives?  Price, depending on your perspective.  The trimmer is worse than useless.  it is quite small and mounted at an odd place in relation to the cutting head making it especially awkward to use.  I use a separate beard and mustache trimmer as I have never found an electric shaver to have a good one.    Bottom line:  this is Norelco's best shaver to date...at least for my face.  It also comes with a 60 day money back guarantee, so you risk nothing by trying it....which you definitely should.",3
5.0,very pleased,3
5,"I purchased the Hydra B5 Gel to use over Cosmetic Skin Solutions Vitamin C and E Serum.  The C and E serum is every bit as good as Skinceutical's much more expensive C and E serum.  In fact the listed ingrediants are the same.  I've purchased three bottles of the C and E serum.<br /><br />This gel is to be used after the C and E serum and before a moisturizer.  It makes my skin feel very smooth and more firm.  I've only used this product for two weeks but I like it very much and if it performs as well as their C and E serum, it will become a staple for me.",3
5,"I've been using this make up remover for years! I wear contact lenses and it doesn't leave an oily residue that would create problems. As well, it's very gentle on the skin around my eyes. Highly recommend.",3
5,This is what I was looking for. Great quality and it's really similar to the real hair of the character.,3

It will however wrinkle if you accidentally paint it on too thick and this is not a problem that i've had with other colors except for the white.

5,I LOVE this wig it was the same color as my hair so it looked super real and it was very soft like my hair,3
4,For daily use and it works to help cover dark circles.,3
5,"AWESOME product, works fantastic. I have a chronic illness and lost most of my brows so summer time is stressful for me because my penciled brows sweat off. I have tried wax, gel, hairspray, etc, nothing worked.  I was googling trying to find something that worked, this popped up and thought I would give it a try.  Boy am I glad I did.  It comes with 2 different applicators, bottle is the size of an average nail polish bottle, so it will last forever, as you only use a tiny bit.  It doesn't have any fragrance, it is not sticky or oily. It is wet& thin like water, so go easy with it.  It dries in seconds and works, works, works. To remove use wash cloth with face cleaner or soap. I tried splashing water on forhead and rubbing off like you would if you were sweating, the brows didn't smudge. I blotted with tissue and blotting sheets, brows stayed put.  You will not be sorry with  this. I feel like I can now enjoy summer without constantly worrying about my disappearing brows.",3
5,very good,3
5,"This is a fantastic brush. My 4-year- old has extremely thick, wavy/curly hair, and there are few things she enjoys less than having her tangle-prone hair brushed. Thankfully, the Sharkk brush has made this particular chore far less painful for both of us. It works great on wet and dry hair, and unlike some similarly designed brushes, it's especially excellent for thick hair. All four females in my household, from child to adult, are impressed with how well this brush works.",3
5,Pretty good stuff,3
5,"This Axe spray smells pretty good, goes on dry and seems to work very well at keeping me dry.  I usually don't like spray ons due to how long they take to dry but this is so dry when it is applied, there is no waiting.  When spraying, there is little to no smell.  However, within a few seconds, the smell comes out.  Not too strong like other Axe products but definitely more noticeable that others I use like Degree.  This is easily in my top 3 for antiperspirants right now.",3

5,Even my husband loves this hand cream. It has a nice no perfume smell and moisturises hands fast without an oily feel to them.,3
5,"excellent delivery. amazing product, for my blond and dry hair is perfect!!! I'm so addicted in it. is the best of all. Brazilian consumer :)",3
5,"Great product. Smells 'interesting' (but the smell doesn't linger, so no problem if you happen not to like it – although I do). Also very economical: it takes only a tiny amount to get my full-face though not very long beard fully foamed up. I assume the formulation is different from head shampoo, but who cares? It's still fun to have along with the beard.",3
5,Had a hard time finding this product. Stumbled on to it by mistake. It was exactly what I was looking for and it was well received as a gift. Thank you,3
5,My mother love this for years. The best,3
5,"I DID A 25% TCA PEEL TODAY, OMG FELT LIKE MY FACE WAS ON FIRE! WATER DID NOT HELP AT THE RINSE PROCESS WITH ANY OF THE BURNING! the neutralizer was wonderful. it totally helped. i dont think i would do another peel if i did not have this neutralizer!  seriously, it is a must have!",3
4,"Amaazing coverage I have a lot acne scars and I only used one layer of this and everything was covered, the only issue though is its for more paler people I'm more of a pale yellowish skin so this doesn't match me at all but I would highly reccomend this product to people with sensitive, pale skin",3
5,Very pretty and shiny! Easy to apply and durable! Just a bit too big but very very very very pretty!,3
5,Nice color,3
4,"It is exactly what you order. Not for anyone who has a TON of makeup, but for the little bit I carry around it was perfect.",3
5,this by  far is the best mask i have tried. you will love it.I USE IT ONCE A WEEK A,3
5,"Loved this derma stamp, I just started dermarolling for a month, and including this stamp for hard to reach places with the dermaroll, it's great!! I highly recommend numbing cream for it, unless you have any pain tolerence, I prefer no pain.",3
5,"XYLIMELTS are the best product I have found for dry mouth. I do have second day shipping and rec'd them in two days, tried other products they only work for about five minutes.",3
4,"A bit strong smell... but has kept my skin basically clear and provides good nutrients and vitamins, without all of the harsh chemicals found in other products.",3
5,This is my fourth Norelco in 40 years.  Excellent quality.,3
5,"First of all, let me start out by saying that I don't normally splurge on super expensive makeup, but when I saw the ModelCo Fiber Lash brush on lashes, I knew I had to try it out.<br />I was a bit reluctant, knowing full well that 50 bucks for mascara was more than my budget, but I decided to take a risk and I am SO GLAD I DID.<br />Not only are my lashes longer because of this product, but they look MUCH thicker. I have small dark deepset eyes, so anything that helps brighten and large them up is a keeper in my book. My lashes look GORGEOUS for once. I am a firm firm believer!!<br />Trust me ladies, if you are nervous about spending this much on mascara, don't be, it's so totally worth it!!<br />xoxo<br />Kim",3
5,"This lipstick is a beautiful baby pink color when applied with a light hand. I wear it everyday, but i think it looks best with light skin tones.",3
5,Works very well.,3
5,I'm a teacher and we (para pros) and myself wore these for Halloween with bat tshirts. Fun and not scary for my special needs kids !,3
5,"I'm a Wen user, but decided to try DevaCurl as it is a lower price. It is every bit as good as Wen:    Left my hair clean and silky  Keeps it clean for a week or more  Diluted, works as a great daily conditioning spray    It also has a divine rose scent!",3
5,"they are so cool,highly recommended ，really really really reaaly love it, i love nails gaga , i will be back,A++++++++",3
5,There is enough product here to see if you want to continue with the line. I was pleasantly surprised.<br />The cleansing milk is my new staple.,3
5,My favorite night on the town Cologne,3
5,"By replacing just the reservoir, I had a brand new waterpik.  The price was much lower than anywhere else.  I am very pleased.",3
5,NON greasy nice non-fragrant lotion. Your skin feels so soft and fantastic. I have eczema and this cream is so soothing. You will notice a difference in your skin so please give this a try. I highly recommend this all natural skin cream. Hard to find a product these days that's not full of all different kinds of cheicals and preservatives. Thank you REDROCK for caring!!! Your fantastic!,3
4,I really like this shampoo. It cleans well and a little goes a long way. It's a bit sticky - but rinses out well.,3
4,this is awesome 😊,3
5.0,The snap feature is much better than the velcro,3
5,"I've been on the hunt for a shampoo that isn't full of chemicals and this is the winner! The other shampoos I've tried do not lather and leave my hair feeling greasy. Nine Naturals lathers like a \\""regular\\"" shampoo and has a nice fresh scent. My baby is due any day now but I plan to continue using this shampoo long after she arrives!",3
5,"My boyfriend bought these brushes for me as a gift. I have been looking for a flat kabuki after seeing my friend and MUA on YouTube using them in some of her makeup tutorials. She always has flawless application and I wanted that too! I was going to buy the brushes from MAC, but at more than $50 a pop I just couldn't bring myself to do it. I still wanted the high quality that MAC provides, but at a less expensive price.  Well I got it. I might even go as far as saying they are better than the MAC face brushes I have. They arrived so quickly, and were wrapped up individually as well as another wrap around all four brushes. They were in amazing condition, they are sturdy and well made. The bristles have had no fall out for me. They are also SO incredibly soft, they feel amazing on your skin. They pick up my liquid foundation and blend seamlessly. As for blush and bronzer, they are very thick and bushy and pick up a lot of product, so I have to tap it off before applying but it looks great once I'm done. I'm very happy with my gift, I will order more brushes from this company. I got the four piece kabuki set I'm gold. I would totally recommended these to anyone, and the high quality for the price!? Girl, if you don't get these you're crazy! You'll love them as much as I do.",3
5,"This product is amazing. I have pretty thin and long hair, and my ends are always dry. I'm in the Army and I'm in Afghanistan, so the combination of the dry air here and having to have my hair constantly in a bun was KILLING my ends. After showering, I put my hair in a ponytail, apply this oil to my ends and then wrap my hair up in a bun. I've been using it for about a month now and my ends are AMAZING now. Very soft, very shiny, no more frizz. I definitely love this stuff, and will be ordering more :)",3
4,It is a good product.There is a big difference betwen this and other shaving creams when you use it with Norelco razor.,3
5,"I have been using Under-It-All for years and have found nothing to compare (especially at this price). It is a non-irritating, long lasting, high SPF sun screen that makes my skin look so much better even without foundation. If I do put foundation over it, I need to use less and my skin looks so good. It looks a little pink out of the tube but seems to blend in just fine with my pale olive skin.",3
5,This is such a pleasant item to use as part of your morning/evening routine. The smell is so fresh and calming. My skin always feels soft and smooth and dewy.,3
5,"If you do not want a strong mint toothpaste, this is a good option. Regularly, my teeth are not all that sensitive, but I do eat a lot of acidy food and drink acidy drinks. I have been usuing this for a few weeks and I have already noticed that my teeth feel stronger.",3
5,Pretty soft scent. Sprayed it on 3 hours ago and the smell is still going strong. Usually I don't smell the scent of my perfumes after an hour or so. I think one squirt behind the ear or on wrist is all u need. Very fast delivery. I plan to order more samples,3
5,"I am super excited to have received and tried these brushes and so happy to have reviewed them. They are perfect to create an everyday look and or to spice it up and try bold smokey eyes and ext... Let your inner makeup guru shine threw ! I also love the soft but sturdy clutch case makes midday or late night touch ups a breeze, and provides ultimate protection for your tools with fitted brush slots and a canvas cover flap to preserve the bristles. Featuring an extra zipper close pocket perfectly sized for your daily essentials, you might just be tempted to leave your purse at home! The brushes are each handcrafted from ultra-lightweight wood, allowing for optimal ease of use without compromising on flawless application. Xtava brushes are truly featherweight champions!<br /><br />Disclaimer I received this product for testing and review purposes my opinions are my own",3
5.0,"A little pricey, but worth it.  My favorite hand lotion, smells so wonderful, everyone always comments on the fragrance!  I use the body lotion too.",3
5,"I have been dying my hair blonde for over a decade, so I have a lot of damaged hair! i've been using this product since May and my hairdresser said she's never seen my hair so healthy. I used to use deep conditioner every day and my hair would still be dry. The WEN kit has brought out the NATURAL oils of my hair so that it is softer and more touchable. I did order from Amazon so I didn't get caught up in the auto shipments and have been very happy. I don't use the recommended amount of pumps. My chin length hair really only needs about 6-8 pumps per shower. When I didn't re-order before my bottle ran out, I switched to regular shampoo and conditioner for about a week and my hair was noticeably drier and frizzier. Can't wait to get back on my WEN!",3
5,Will definitely buy again!,3
5,These people make really good soap.  It smells marvelous and lasts a long time.  Most importantly it gets you clean without leaving a soapy film.,3
5,"Love it, love it, love it!!!! This product completely helps with frizz without leaving my hair greasy and the smell is &#34;to die for&#34;.",3
5,"This does exactly what it promised.. I can't speak personally to this but my niece is extremely excited and has been texting me incessantly.. She want a 1 year supply (It controlled her oily skin, large pores and acne)",3
5.0,lots of incense for a great price!,3
4,Excellent product for aches and pains.  I get relief after 5 minutes of applying.  The only downside is that that the odor is rather strong.,3
4,My Girlfriend suggested this. It smells good. I have been getting a lot of compliments at work. I like it.,3
5,"I was unsure as to how this thing would really work.  But I can tell you, I LOVE this thing! Works great. Getting ready for work has never been this easy!",3
5,"I'm a man, age 82.  My headline describes my hair.  After shampooing and  combing, it loos good--while wet.  Untreated and dry, it's &#34;all over the place.&#34;<br />  Creams I've tried look greasy.  Other sprays I've tried haven't done the job.  Mink does!<br />  I like it so well that, unable to find it in a store here in Santa Barbara, CA, USA, I went online.  The only way I could buy a can of it was by buying a box of 24 cans.  I did.",3
4,Would have given 5 stars but a few of the bristles started to come off.,3
5,This has worked well for us.  We've had it for a few months and it has not leaked or given us any problems.,3
4,Auto off feature is nice!,3
5,I received two of these to see how I liked them and they both stand up to the test and smell great!,3
5,"Enough granules to feel it working but also enough moisture to feel wonderful.<br />The smell is very nice, I don't care for perfumes or strong scents. This is a natural scent.",3
5,"Greatest oil ever. I use it to massage my Back, and to rub on my kids' chests, temple and around when they are congested. It works wonders. Try it you wont be disappointed.",3
4,"I really like this eyeliner.  It goes on easily which is great for a make-up challenger person like I am.  It lasts as well or better than anything else I've used and it doesn't irritate my eyes.  When I couldn't locate it at any local store, I stocked up on it from Amazon and at a better price.",3
5,They really work and make keeping feet callus free and well groomed a snap. I would recommend them to anyone looking for good pedicure tools.,3
5.0,"Love it. Recommended by my esthetcian and I used it twice a day. my skin looks and feels clean and moist. This has become my only cleanse I will use. I use to use clinique, but this beats it.",3
5,this stuff works great and it stops infections. i used it for my nose ring and it healed pretty quickly.,3
4,It works!,3
5,Its VERY nice! Smells just like watermelon and has a  decent staying power. I will definitely buy this yummy perfume again!,3
5,"The product is genuine, and it was shipped most promptly!  The price was favorable, too.  I will not hesitate to shop at this store again.",3
5,"This superb product contains all natural ingredient, its fragrance free, the creme blends easily into the skin, continuous use provides skin with a noticeable difference.",3
5,This product saved my hair!!! Love it,3
5,These are strong and reliable. I love them.,3
5,"My daughter, a beach lover, is very concerned, as we all should  be, with saving marine life in all its forms. When she found out that sunscreen is causing the deterioration of coral reefs all over the world, she searched for a safe alternative. She's been using Kinesys for several years, and in her opinion, it's the best on the market. Does its job of preventing sunburn and skin damage, while containing safe ingredients that won't harm the oceans. She swears by it and now has her friends using it as well. The spray bottle is very convenient, and actually works (no clogging). I ordered this for her, and when we go to the beach or pool together, I use it as well.",3
5,"matches my skin perfectly....silky smooth, long lasting, to the last drop...love it",3
5,"I use this every time that I shower! I've been using it since early September and just now having a chance to give it a review. I've been cursed with body acne, especially around my buttocks and upper back, for years. I've been to the dermatologist that had put me on a cream that was too harsh and would cause cysts if used for a prolonged period of time. Panoxyl does wonders! I had looked up reviews upon reviews searching for a good body wash that would give me relief, after a week I could noticeably see results and I only have break outs every so often! I would recommend this to anyone, but just be weary about how often you use it, it can cause dry/sensitive skin!",3
4,"Not noisy, great heat differences to choose from.  Wish that the airstream on the cool setting was more gentle.  It was expensive, I guess I paid for the good review and if it lasts a long time, I will be happier!",3
5,Best Best Best cream every.  I sue it on my face to my heels.  It makes everything so soft.,3
4,"This half wig is very cute, the curls are nice and keep their shape so no need to use the curling iron. The hair is not too abundant which I like because its lightweight but its too shiny to blend with my real hair but if you.run a little bit of baby powder through it with your hands than it takes away a lot of the shine. I love to take about 2 inches of the hair above my forehead and pin it back with a little puff, looks so real all together. I feel lovely with this wig, just wish the texture was softer",3
5,"With so many products out there you never know what's a good one for you until you try.  Black night 60x is great product.  It goes on nice, smells clean, leaves your skin silky soft and doesn't give you that feared carrot orange glow :)  I would buy this lotion again.",3
5.0,"I like this. It helps me remove the extra polish next-ed to the nail. The cuticle pusher really gets the finger nail clean,",3
4,Using this product has made my cuticles less dry and more pliable.<br /><br />Wish the brush were larger and the hole the brush goes in on top of the bottle were larger.,3
5,"My periodontist gave me a sample of these and they worked great around my crowns.  I dip them in mouthwash, and use them after brushing and flossing.  My checkups have been awesome.  Couldn't find them in the drugstore, so Amazon with free shipping is the way to go.",3
5,"This is a great razor! I previously used the popular Venus Embrace (it even says on the Personna package that they are comparable) and they pretty much are. But Personna's Halo razor is even better with its cruelty-free high quality! And it's cheaper on Amazon! I love the ergonomic handle, too. It doesn't say in the description, but it came with a holder and suction cup that you can attach to your shower wall!",3
5,I TRIED THIS PRODUCT JUST FOR THE HECK OF IT - WELL I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT NOW OR SHOULD I SAY MY FACE CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT - I AM 63 YEARS AND HAVE OR SHOULD I SAY HAD DEEP WRINKLES ON THE LEFT SIDE OF MY FACE - THEY WERE FROM THE SUN FROM DRIVING THE SUN HITS THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE GLASS - WELL THEY ARE GONE - YES THAT IS RIGHT GONE - I CANNOT LIVE WITH OUT THIS - I AM THE OLDEST PERSON WHERE I WORK AND LOOK THE BEST - JUST FABLOUS SKIN SINCE I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT - I AM TOTALLY ADDICTED NOW - EVEN MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW WHO IS AN ESTATICIAN CAN'T BELIEVE THE DIFFERENCE - SHE WAS GIVING ME ALL KINDS OF TREATMENTS ON MY SKIN - AND THIS IS THE PRODUCT THAT CHANGED THE WAY I LOOK - YES IT REALLY DID - GOD BLESS U PEOPLE THAT FORMULATED IT - [[ASIN:B004R3PDYO Dermalift - Sp Rejuvenating Plumping Cream - 66% OFF Discount link Activated]],3
5,I prefer it more than any other brand and have always received compliments for the same. Just love it. The frangrance is pleasant and long lasting. Price is great!,3
5,This is a great electric toothbrush.  Well worth the money.  Amazon had a great price on the replacement brushes.  Recommended by my dentist.  I glad I got it.  Better check up since I got it.,3
5.0,Great,3
5.0,Works exceptionally well.  Have been using a better known brand for over 50 years.  This one works just as well for a much lesser price.,3
5,"It is so nice to be able to replace the hose and handle as opposed to replacing the whole unit. I had gone through 3 Water Pik machines over the years with no way to replace a cracked hose. My latest unit had just cracked it's hose and what a relief to find this kit on Amazon. My unit has two exposed screws holding the hose onto the bottom. Took the two Phillips screws out, put the new one in. Done in 5 seconds. Anyone can do this with ease.",3
4,"My skin is oily, and most face lotions with sunscreen make my face shiny immediately.  This one does add a little sheen, but I find it's tolerable.  I don't often wear any makeup, but if I feel my skin is too shiny after applying the lotion, a little powder fixes it.",3
5,Fantastic product. Easy to use. Long lasting!,3
5,A wonderful thing to have it keeps you iron and blow dryer off your vanity. The cords do not tangle up like they do if they are laying on a surface together. It is an inexpensive way to get rid of clutter.,3
5,"I bought to help with stretch marks. I bought another one from different maker, but this one I feel no pain when I use it. As a matter of fact I had to press hard just to feel it, but then hours later I was super red like I had a bad sunburn. So i guess it worked. i would buy again.  I will update in a month.",3
5,Wife loves it.,3
5,"My hair is very fragile and quite fine.  Yet I like to wear it curly.  I like this product because it really helps define my curls without adding so much weight that the curls lose their bounce.<br /><br />Hint:  If you really don't like that &#34;crunchy&#34; feeling of gel in your hair, do what I do:  When I bought my second bottle, I poured half into the empty bottle, filled both with filtered water.  It still works great, but goes farther and feels even softer.",3
5.0,I was so happy when I got this product; would definetly do business with this company again.  Good job and great price,3
4,Love the size of this towel.  It fits on my head without weighing a ton<br />like a regular towel does!!,3
5,These work great. My toe is feeling much better after a few weeks of daily wear.,3
5,great product.,3
5,Great product,3
5,Great chair,3
5,"I love this scent for after showers and to wear every day for a clean, fresh, feminine scent. You can use it sparingly and it lasts. I've gotten several compliments on it and people always tell me I smell so good and &#34;clean&#34;.",3
5,"I have extremely fine hair,  and since I like to wear it long, I have a lot of problem with it weighing itself down and plastering to my skull. I've tried a lot of things (mousse, blow drying it upside down, backcombing, special shampoos and conditioners), and I just couldn't get volume to stick around for more than 15 minutes. Then I found an article about hair powders, and decided to try this one.<br /><br />I swear,  it's like magic! I just make a bunch of parts,  and sprinkle some down each part. Then I flip my head over and work it into the roots. It's really bizarre - you can kind of feel it turn from a powder to a liquid,  and then dry. Once it's dry, I flip my head back over and BOOM - I actually have the volume I've been trying to get for years! I might try others, but I'm definitely a hair powder convert now.",3
5,I have gotten this lotion before so I already know it was good loton but what a great deal. Defintly recommend it.,3
5,As expected...,3
5,This is a great product! It leaves my skin very moisturizer and I really like that it doesn't leave a greasy feel.,3
5,Using this its a great product looks like its working will keep using feels good on the eyes and makes the skin smooth,3
5,I use this product for my natural textured hair or my flat ironed hair and it works very well on either wet or damp to dry hair,3
5,Great product!,3
5,"These are impossible to find where I live and I refuse to buy a new razor just because I can't find heads, so I'm glad to find them here. I replace these every two years (need to every year, but I'm too cheap). My beard is pretty tough, though, so you may find you need replacements less often.",3
5,I love this product.  Works perfectly with the Ultrax shampoo.  It keeps my hair soft and fills in the gaps to make it fuller.,3
4,"I love this conditioner for it's detangling purposes. I'm relaxed and when the new growth comes in and I can't handle it, I usually apply this conditioner to my ROOTS ONLY. I don't know how it does it, but it softens the new growth tremendously. But for some reason (on my hair, I'm not sure how it will affect other people's hair), it tends to increase my shedding, not to a tremendous, tear-inducing amount of course - since i still use it - but you do notice it. I don't use it for every wash, only when needed. Thanks for reading!",3
5,I really enjoy a luxurious moisturizer that deeply hydrates my skin.  This anti-aging cream feels great and makes my face supple and soft.  I like that it is not thin and watery but luscious.  Will definitely continue to use.,3
4,Ok,3
5,"I asked Dermatologist to recommend a moisturizer for drier winter skin, and this was her suggestion.  This product is great - moisturizes without being greasy or sticky - and doesn't clog pores.  I also like the fact that it contains sunscreen.  Just wish it came in a pump.",3
5,"My dog and I sat next to a woman on our flight to Prague who smelled absolutely delicious. A asked her what fragrance she was wearing, and she replied Marc Jacobs. I remember it was fresh and clean, and subtly floral without being overly sweet.<br /><br />Now - 6 months later - I came across it in Lord & Taylor, sprayed a tester on my wrist, and instantly remembered why the fragrance was so captivating. Without more than 30 seconds of contemplation I purchased the gift set - can't wait to experience this fresh, winning scent over and over again.",3
5,"I am so happy I bought this flat iron from Small Bill.  Great price and amazingly the best flat iron I have ever had aside from the Chi flat iron I used to have but the original chi's are not sold any longer and are not top quality anymore as they used to be.  For this price I couldn't believe how great the iron was.  I saw them being sold at the mall and the girl said they are $200 but on sale for $100.  You know how the mal l is I probably could have made her come down even more on the price but I told her that was too much for me and she gave me some free samples that I loved of the hair mask.  Well, overall I am above and beyond happy with this item and go with Small Bill for the seller.  I literally got the flat iron in 2 days!!!  I couldn't believe it :)  Best buying experience I have ever had.",3
5,"This is one of the best tanning lotions ever!! I am 35 and I have been tanning since I was 16, so I know what I am talking about. It does have a Hot tingle factor for about 30 mins to an hour then it's no so bad. But it is worth it! It smells good to. Just be careful using this or any other tingle lotion when around children so they dont get it on them. It would really hurt there sensitive skin! You will love this lotion!",3
5,"Best shampoo. Great for fine, thin hair",3
5,"Can not live with out it...my good this is magic, try it , it is great",3
5,"I have always had very sensitive skin but lucky that my only outbreaks were hormonal and not chronic.  I haven't always been so kind to my skin, sleeping in my makeup during my wild youth and perhaps no so wild youth, but now I'm trying to stick to a regimen that's simple and effective.  Enter this wonderful product.  After washing my face, when it's still just slightly dewy and completely clean, I do one pearl of serum in my hand and then dot it under my eyes, between my brows, along those 'Howdy Doody' smile lines that eventually catch up to us as we get older, and then I work it in all over my face.  A little goes a very long way and it soaks into my skin almost instantly, so there isn't that oily or heavy feeling that some moisturizers can leave behind making you worry that you'll pick up pillow case lint after you go to bed.  The fragrance is light, citrusy, and it gives me a little aroma-reminder that I have done something good for my skin.  When I get up in the morning my face is so soft and fresh looking, no oily look left behind and it doesn't cause my own natural oils to become a problem.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a simple regimen that produces clear results in no time at all.",3
5,Works well on mosquitoes.,3
5,Everyone comments when I pull this out! Hard to pick one color they are so cute and trendy! Keep up the good work!,3
5.0,Purchased three cans of the Framesi Mousse and I was please with the product.  It has just the right amount of hold.  Very pleased with the vendor.  The item arrived earlier than expected and packaging was good.<br />Good experience!,3
4,Great price and effective. Regular use will even skin and lighten P.I.H.<br />Use sunblock and save money on MD Forte.. You wont regret it.,3
5,"There are many types of incense I don't really enjoy.  Some are too strong or smoky.  This HEM Amber incense is lovely and has a kind of warm clean spicy smell.  It's my go to when I want something that isn't really overwhelming, but that makes my home smell welcoming, clean and is a scent many seem to enjoy.",3
4,"They are worth the prize , I loved it but the shipment took forever",3
5,"I have had this brush for several years.  As with most natural brushes it needs to be broken in.  The first week or so the bristles will shed, it has to do with the over stuffing of the holes.  Once that happens, the scent gets really good.  I have really thin hair and usually keep a high and tight fade.  This keeps the top parted to the side to give it a good professional look.  It distributes the natural oils nicely leaving the hair soft.",3
5,Smells wonderful!!  Couldn't ask for a better deal..,3
5,"I just purchased these at Ulta today and they are gorgeous ! The nicest nail decal out there. I wish there was a zoom photo for you to see it. Each nail design unique but goes with the story. The background is black with yellow and pink flowers (peonies) and there are small details such as ladybugs and butterflies....yet the entire design is sophisticated, not too floral. There are 12 decals (2 of each design) and one has the signature Butter crowned crow. I haven't used them yet (but have used the Sally Hanson \\""love letters\\"" stickers) but plan on having a pedicure and seeing if they will apply it for me with a clear coat on top. They are so pretty I don't want to mess it up! I also have to say that I got mine half price $5.00 on clearance but if they work out I'll be here on Amazon to buy them plus shipping, they are unique, sophisticated (ugh so many tacky nails out there as I'm sure you've noticed) and worth every penny. As you can tell I LOVE IT and may even buy as set as treat for a friend : )",3
5,Love this.,3
5,Holds well without being sticky.  Fash shipment and great hair spray.  I will purchase it again.  Much cheaper to buy here than in the salon.,3
5.0,"I've been using the NOW brand lavender previously bc I can get it at the store. I am very sensitive to any impurities and once I tried Nature's Oil Lavender I realized that I've been using an inferior product with the NOW. This lavender smells very &#34;clean&#34;, pure, natural. I love the scent! the difference is night and day!",3
5.0,"tThis is one of the most beautiful scents I have ever had!!1 the bottle is pretty big,,thought, it was going to be smaller!!!  I love it..so happy I bought it!!!!",3
5,"updated 6/12-- have to change previous review because the company responded quickly to my direct complaint to them & sent me a coupon for a freebie--- used it & got another braun which has been fantastic!!  must have gotten a lemon on the first try, but very pleased with this one-- find that carefully cleaning the open slots then rinsing the toothbrush removes accumulated debris for better hygiene-- it IS difficult to open to change the batteries, but i know it's waterproof to be sure!!<br /><br />1st review: not good after continued use! agree with review that the rotation goes to VERY slow after few uses & does so intermittently from then on!! VERY aggravating-- new batteries, new head do NOT fix the problem!!  1st power toothbrush & figured Braun would be best.... not so with this one-- will try another brand for sure, but a powered brush is the way to go!",3
5,"Very easy to apply, with a natural looking result -  Better than most other such bronzers,  after much searching was Delighted to<br />find it here on Amazon. com !",3
5,I live in Italy and I ordered this parfum directly in the USA. It arrived in Italy after one month and it took another month to go through the customs at milano Linate!and the postman charged another 25 extra euro with the delivery...I will buy another one ONLY physically in the US. The parfum is okay and with the original packaging.,3
5,This product does exactly what it says. Revitalizes my wavy/curly hair on the days I don't wash it. Sometimes I use it 2 days in a row. Bottle lasts me about a year. Great buy.,3
4,I like this serum.  Hence I tried their skin lotion and was disappointed.,3
5.0,Best razor ever! Left my legs so smooth dodnt even need lotion after! Never got razor bumps either and i did with my other razor! Love love love this razor and now this will be the only razo i use!,3
4,Samples and they are not to be sold  it says it  on the label .If go to Macy's and ask there is a good chance you can get them for free,3
5,I was having some serious problems with adult acne/spot breakouts. I read about this product in a magazine article where it was recommended along with this product La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo Dual Action Acne Treatment http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004L8J15C/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />the combination of the two have really saved my skin.,3
5,This winter has been especially rough on not only my skin but my hair also. My hair is a mess and I like to wear my hair natural since it is curly and well I am a bit lazy on the hair front trying to give it a break from the flat iron and blow dryer. I have found that while my hair is thick I have a lot of damage to it. The weather and styling has dried it out horribly this winter so I was looking for something that would help before the warm weather hits. There are so many things I need to get together before summer hits. Anyway when I found this at a great price and given the chance to give my opinion on it I jumped at it. I have heard all the benefits of Argon oil and thought I would see how it worked out for me. So far it has only been a couple of days but my hair doesn’t feel as horrible as it did before I started using this product. There is nothing worse than walking around with a frizzy mane of hair; at least if it is healthy it looks a lot better. Of course I know I am due for a cut but overall my hair is looking better which is what I was hoping for. The ends that were dry don’t feel as dry and my hair is starting to look like it did before I gave up during the cold weather. I am happy with this and it doesn’t take a lot so my hair doesn’t have that oily look to it. I like it better than the coconut oil that I usually use and I haven’t found any build up. All around I am loving this and will continue to use it.,3
5,"Excellent covers, good price and great quality.",3
5,This thing works. I have easily gotten 6 months use out of a razor blade. Even at that the blades are still good but the rest of the cartridge falls apart and it needs replaced. I just follow the directions and I use soap instead of shaving cream.,3
5,Perfect,3
4,"Simple construction, nice freshness lock, the 1 thing I'd complain about is there's no line or symbol indicating where the 5ml line would be.",3
4,"For several years now I've been fighting acne, the products that have helped me proactive, but the unfortunate part of using these products \\""dry skin\\"" starts to appear and I also noticed my skin wasn't looking healthy, so I decide to change it up and start using Olay complete moisture cream and I tell you within a week my skin has been looking healthy and acne has been under-control. And skeptic just give this cream a try it can improve your skin for the better. I will be trying out the night cream soon.",3
5,Good product.,3
5,Beautiful color. It was everything I expected and more. Will buy another one if Mysterious Red is still in stock.,3
5,The product completely justified its marketing hype. I shave everyday and the useful life of my blades are now extended by a month or more. Incredible! I've bought it for all my close friends and they are equally delighted with it.,3
4,"The clippers work very well.  They are a bit bulky with the vacuum attachment, but overall it does  the job.  It would be nice if this model contained an internal vacuum.  Being tethered to a vacuum cleaner can be challenging sometimes while cutting hair.  Nevertheless, this is a very good set of clippers.  It provides an adequate number of guards, a taper adjustment, and makes clean-up a cinch.",3
5,"Great size and good looking - perfect for my needs which were to get rid of half used larger non spray bottles of cologne and transfer them into this style atomizer making for more efficient application of the fragrance, and simpler storage in bathroom cabinet. highly recommended.",3
5,I usually don't like powdery scents at all. I'm generally a citrus girl. But I got a free sample of this perfume and really started to enjoy it. When the sample ran out I had to have my own bottle. I love the fresh stemy scent of the early stages. And the powdery drydown is comforting without being overpowering.,3
5,excelente,3
5,"This product works well.  It does not &#34;freeze&#34; my hair, allows it to move without getting messy and does not leave a film, something I dislike about a lot of heavier products.  Best for when my hair has grown out a bit in between hair cuts, as opposed to when it is shorter and I need something with a little more control (the &#34;more control&#34; product does leave a bit of a film).",3
4,"Used this toothbrush system for years and works great.  The unit I received didn't look like the picture shown.  I was hoping to get the newer version and instead received the old version.  The system is still great, but the picture is misleading.",3
5,"I bought this for my mom since she has a lot of dark spots and wrinkles. She looked like her skin was burnt. She did not want to try getting a microdermabrasion from the clinics so I got this for her. After 1 week of applying, her skin started peeling. We started to see huge changes after about 3 weeks. After about 2 months, her dark spots were gone and wrinkles less visible. She was so happy with the product, it made her look much younger. I liked it so much I purchased it for myself! My face felt super smooth!",3
5,"This lipstick set is great, so many colours !  Have'nt tried all of them yet, but I have lots of time to. Thanks.",3
5,"Love these wipes.  I carry them in the car and in my purse and occasionally use them around the house.  Every time I leave a store I wipe my hands with them.  I feel it keeps me from getting sick, especially during flu season.  They leave your hands feeling clean and fresh.  They do not leave lotion on your hands.",3
5,Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Skin Therapy Lotion does what it says it will! No false advertising here! It makes your skin feel soft as velvet. I would recommend it highly!,3
5,I love Maybelline products this is one I plan to keep buying it gets the job done a 5 star product,3
4.0,It goes on smooth and silky and smells nice. It is not sticky and it doesn't leave stains on your clothes. Also it takes a lot longer time for under arm hair to grow back and when it does it is not as coarse. It is too bad that Dove discontinued this product!,3
5,Since this was my first double edge razor I had a hard time putting the razor blade in it. This was an issue I fixed by looking up how to videos on youtube. I got to say I love it this is definitely a good investment. Bye-bye Gillette and all those money hungry companies. It's well made with a nice metal handle that will last a long time. Just remember to take it apart by unscrewing the handle and drying everything off properly so you don't get any rust. I definitely recommend all of you to purchase one and give it a try. I will be buying more.,3
5,Wow!  This is awesome!  It truly cut the time way less than usual!  Usually my wrist starts to hurt from how long it takes to blow dry my hair.  It took about a third of the time..not long enough for my wrist to hurt. yay!  I love it.. will definitely buy again.  And what a great price :),3
5,So glad to find this shade from L'Oreal...sad it was discontinued...just what I ordered...will try to order again when I can...,3
5,"I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE these cloths! I am 23 and have been using them since I was 13, when I first started wearing makeup. I will not use anything else to remove my makeup. They easily remove makeup, even waterproof mascara and leave my face feeling fresh and clean. Also, since I am cheap, I started cutting them in half and they still work wonders. I used to be able to buy these everywhere (Costco used to have a 3-pack which was awesome but then it got discontinued!) but they seem to be disappearing. My face is combination: dry in some areas and oily in others. These cloths are just perfect.",3
5,"Since this year my husband got me hook on Dr. Bronner's Magic Soap Hemp Almond and Eucalyptus to use it to wash my hair and body but not my face cause it broke out my so mainly I stick only to my Dudu Osun Black Soap and homemade pore strips. However, this product has took the oil and dandruff out of my hair I got rid of my other shampoos & conditioners to save money on Dr. Bronner's.",3
4,"So, I have a love at first smell story with this perfume. I smelled it in a magazine and I'm not the type of person who buys things just cuz they are in a magazine... but I couldn't stop smelling the page. So, I went out and bought it (from Macy's, I think) the more I used it the more I loved it. It has the perfect combo of a citrus, floral, and fresh scents. I love it. So glad I found it on here!",3
5,Very gentle on the face yet I swear i saw an overnight difference. Will be purchasing again that is for sure.,3
5,"GREAT FOR HAIR. MY FAMILY USED WHEN I WAS A CHILD. WILL CONT. TO USE WHEN AVAILABLE.PLACE IT IN STORES IN QUAKERTOWN, PA AND KINSTON NC THANKS",3
5,"These sprayers produce a fine mist with a good volume and no spatters.  They can also be adjusted to shoot a solid stream of water up to about 12 feet, handy if you have cats.  Well constructed, thick plastic.  This is a good product.",3
5,"Excellent product.  I've been using Brilliantine Pomade by Joico for more years than I've been surfing the Great Lakes of the Midwest.  This, for me, is the best pomade on the market - great hold, without the &#34;greasy&#34; look some pomades promote.  A small amount only needs to be used to style your hair and keep it looking good throughout the day.  As I said, an excellent product, and a great price through Amazon.  Gotta go - surf's up!<br /><br />Your friend,<br />Biff",3
4,"This white paste comes in a great tube design. I like that the cap can't be lost, and it's great for multi-taskers like myself, who want to be able to open & squeeze & put away toothpaste in one fast motion using just one hand.<br /><br />The flavor is minty and pleasing. I'm not sure I noticed much whitening effect, but I have used the whitening strips quite recently so that's probably why. Overall, I am pleased with this paste!",3
5,"I have been a 3-blade razor user since the Gillette Mach 3 came out. I have sensitive skin and often get knicks and pulls that leave my face feeling irritated. Because of this, I was hesitant to advance my shaving utensil to a 4- or 5-blade razor. Often when I get a new Gillette Mach 3 razor, I get some minor cuts because the blades are so new and sharp. I cannot tell you if that was what caused me to grow a beard, or if it was just a fashion statement. When I recieved the free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer through a special offer with Gillete, I decided I would put it to the test and get the full effect of this new razor... the beard had to go. I used the Power Trimmer with the 2-guard attachment to groom the entire beard down. This was a very power tool and much less bulky than the full clippers I was previously using. I then decided to have some fun and try out the trimming functionality, so I shaved most of the beard completely off. I was very pleased by the smoothness of the shave and didn't get the pulls and knicks that I was used to with my previous razor. My wife was not as impressed as I was by my fu manchu, but in all honesty the trimmer cut clean lines and it was easy to shape a unique mustache.<br /><br />For those of you that have facial hair or conduct any regular man-scaping. I would highly recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer. My only complaint is that my beard is gone. My wife likes the clean shaved look, so it will stay for now.<br /><br />As an added bonus, I have used the vibrating handle while shaving and you get the feel of an electric razor with the closeness of a real blade.",3
5.0,"If you want a good dental check up, these are the things to use----regularly.",3
5,"Love this product!  It leaves my skin dewy and glowing!  I definitely see a difference when I use it verses when I use my moisturizer alone.  Also, it smells and feels amazing!",3
5,"I used Josie Maran's argan oil most exclusively on my face, for the bottle is quite small and when I bought it, it was also more expensive than it is showing to be now. Frankly, as much as I loved how it absorbed into my skin and felt wonderful, I was debating on whether to purchase more, because the amount of product is so small, and when I did run out over a month ago I didn't re-purchase, choosing instead to try some other products.<br /><br />Then, when I received a notice that I hadn't yet reviewed the product, I saw the price was lower, so I am going to purchase another bottle. I see there is a \\""special deal\\"" code, so I best hurry.<br /><br />The oil comes with an \\""ear-drop\\"" delivery where you squeeze out a little at a time onto your fingertips - I did really like this, as it helped me to control the amount, and you do not need very much of this product! Especially for your skin. With any lingering amount after I smoothed it onto my face and throat, I'd pull my hands through my hair.<br /><br />Despite being called an \\""oil\\"" this is not an oily product. I have rocasea and my skin is somewhat sensitive, yet I was able to use this product effectively, and my face was smooth and not at all oily after application.<br /><br />I have bought other \\""argan oil\\"" products since this one, including ones with coconut, avocado, and other oils, but so far, all but Agadir Argan oil are much oilier and heavier than the Josie Maran, and they are not \\""pure argan oil\\"" as JM product apparently is (I hope!) - though, the other products are also much cheaper. Still, sometimes you really do \\""get what you pay for,\\"" and with the special deal, I will order another bottle and try to make it last as long as I can by using it only on my face, maybe several times a week instead of every night.<br /><br />Anyway, as that old commercial used to say, \\""aren't we worth it . . .\\"" ? haw!",3
5,"I think this works, so 5* to this product.<br /><br />And reviewing after 2yr of purchase, shows that this product works and last long too.",3
5,Still the best.,3
5,Great buckle !,3
5,"i think i bought up the last of the supply, but this really makes my hair look and feel great!",3
5,"Wear sandals 85% of the time, and the air just dries out my feet - this product really helps keep my feet smooth and supple.",3
5,"So far, this has been the most successful lotion in resolving my eczema issues. As a previous reviewer said, if this does not work for you, keep trying other lotions. We are all different. This works for me and I am very please.",3
5,"none the less great product, when I do use it, it holds well but not too strongly. Hair becomes very workable and manageable",3
5,Great trimmer and does everything that it said it would. Gives a much closer trim than my Philips-Norelco.<br />I would highly recommend it.,3
5.0,This is just like Clinique bronzer except a better price... Love it because there is no sparkle to it like a lot of cheap bronzers,3
4,"This set is simply amazing. I love the selection of brushes available to me now and have become spoiled having such a selection! The only \\""Negative\\"" I would have is that its extremely bulky. The picture of course makes it look like it is compact. I put all the brushes in a glass candle holder with coffee beans to keep them upright and only use the case for traveling! I can promise you will love this set though!",3
5,"Out of all the different products I've tried, this one is my favorite. It works splendidly! There is no need to look elsewhere girls!",3
4,This perfume smell soo good I love it! Definitively Something you need to have in your bureau . No doubt!,3
5,Have one in our motorhome where counter-top space is at a premium.  Most standard waterpiks would take up the entire counter.  Bought this one for a vacation home for similar reasons.,3
5,Amazing smell and very lovely packaging .. definitely i will buy again,3
4,A good product for a good price.<br />And so on and so forth.  I've already said all there is to say,3
5,Works great but so expensive.  The good news is I only have to use a tiny bit.,3
4,This straightner works great.  Nice size to handle.  I like the fact that you can lock it into a closed position.  Don't be fooled by the price.  It is awesome.,3
5,"A long time ago, I got dentures.  The dentist didn't put a liner in, so this is a nice alternative.",3
5.0,Smells amazing and it works!  I've been told I look more rested and younger since I started using this product.,3
4.0,"These are perfectly fine,  Somewhat small than some, puff up when wet again.  Still beats $15 for one at &#34;the makeup stores at the mall&#34;.",3
5,This is the second Panasonic ER389K trimmer for me.  I wore the last one out after lots of use. I have a moustache that needs attention every other day.  I also like to keep sideburns trimed. I would highly recommend this trimmer.,3
5,I used this at my salon and brought home the travel bottle. I was pleasantly surprised to find a bigger bottle here. Smells good works great.,3
5,"I am a 24 year old male.  I've had no issues with baldness or concerns about hair thinning in the past, but recently I started to notice a lot of hair thinning.  When I would use product in my hair and when my hair was wet, I was starting to see my scalp. Naturally I started to get concerned.  My first thought was perhaps it was my conditioner that I was using, I stopped using that and just switched to a regular head and shoulders type product.  When I realized it was a combination of the water in my house and the time of year (I live in the midwest and its very dry and cold in the winter), I started to look for a better shampoo. I found this product online almost a month ago.<br /><br />After one month of use I started to feel amazing results. I did not realize it but the hard water in tandem with the shampoo I was using was actually creating an intangible build up or residue on my scalp which was preventing and in fact impeding new hair growth!  After one month of use, I've had amazing results! New hairs have already started sprouting up on my head and my hair feels stronger, fuller, and thicker! I am SO grateful to this product.  It is worth EVERY penny! Thank you Malibu!!!!",3
5.0,"Great little clippers, very sharp and motor is strong.  These seem to be high quality",3
5,Love these.  Excellent price and so soft while still strong.  Perfect for make up removal and first aid clean up.,3
5,"I love all colors and types of this fake nail.<br />I used to try and do my own gel nails (I was pretty good), the sticker nails, all sorts of valiant efforts to get great looking nails that lasted - these are the first thing that has worked amazingly!<br />I have had compliments from nail professionals!<br />A few key points - DO NOT wash your hands for at least an hour after application.<br />I keep the bottle with spare nails, the file, and Nailene Ultra Adhesive tabs with me at all times.  The nails stay on great, but I've been known to push them a bit too far and lose maybe 2-3 nails over 3-7 days time.  If I have the tabs I can rub the existing glue off the back of any nails that fall off, and stick them back on with a tab.  If I lose the nail completely, I can apply a new one and file it down to match the old.<br />I have an active job, so this lets me have good looking nails for an event, and I can take them off when I need to have short nails for surgery or active work.<br />They have been known to last up to 2 weeks for me.",3
5,"I have tried every product on the market for dry cracked hands from expensive to cheap. This is the most effective one I've ever tried. It goes on incredibly easy, smooth, no grease or stickiness. And (best part for me) it seems to last all day through multiple hand washings!",3
5,"Since I loved this scent in the shower Mousse, I took a chance on the lotion. Now I love this product too!",3
5,Mmmm smells yummy. The size is a gift size. I did think it was gonna be bigger but the shea butter cream is thick and makes your skin feel like silk. The sugar scrub is wonderful as well. I am a Tree Hut fan.I use their shea butter sugar scrub I was just about out and decided to try this set. I never used their body butter before. I will be now. I love this scent. Cant wait to use again in the shower today. This is gonna go fast so I will be ordering the full size of both. I am 8  months pregnant and because of shea butter I have not gotten one stretch mark. My sister in law has taken notes. I cant say enough about the yummy scent. Extremely satisfied,3
5,d a friend recommend the product.  I really liked how my hair shined.  I don't use a lot and I use it on my wet hair before I blow dry and flat iron it.,3
5,love this product! if my head aches I put some on forehead &  it helps my head to stop hurting also the arthritis in my hands to stop hurting when I rub it on them.,3
5,"I had never found an eyeliner that didn't melt or crease shortly after application until I found this stuff.  I like many PF products, but this one especially I love.  I wish the black eyeliner didn't have any sparkles, but it is subtle enough for everyday wear.",3
4,"I think it is great for the armpits and bikini line but the other reviewers are right when they say it is very painful for legs and for this reason I am not giving five stars. You may know this but definitely do not use it on your face at all, I dared to try it on my chin and got a little cut that left a scar that took months to fade away.",3
5,"I really like this product because it works well on quickly healing shaving cuts.  I especially like this large jumbo size.  This size lasts a long time, but is also small enough to easily fit in my travel bag.  It is hard to find this size and I'm glad it is sold on Amazon.",3
5,"I no longer have to spend an hour to remove all my polish, top and base coats.  This stuff takes me only about 10 minutes for all 10 fingers.  Keeps me from getting cramps in my hands just to remove the polish.  Highly recommended!",3
5,Great for my frizzy hair.  I blow it dry then use a large curling iron.  Helps keep my hair smooth.,3
5,I recently bought the DevaFuser attachment for my hairdryer at home. The fuser broke so I decided to buy the hairdryer and fuser combo because they fit each other. Great product! I feel like my hair is less frizzy by using the hairdryer and fuser instead of just the fuser. I did feel like it was a little expensive but worth the money.,3
5,Great stuff,3
4.0,"Nice color - but prefer Bubble Bath, as it is lighter and cleaner looking - not as pink a shade.",3
5,"Of all the violet toners, mousses, gels, other shampoos and conditioners, I have found this product to be the best for my newly grey hair.  I wash my hair every day and this gives just enough violet without appearing too blue and brittle.  I did try the Joico Color Endure Violet conditioner along with this, but it was too much and unlike the shampoo, had too much perfume.",3
4,like it but not enough usage yet to go 5 stars.....versitale makeup  mirror...I am sure I will<br />really like it with further usage.,3
5,"In spite of all of the claims these are not legit blades, I bought them.  They are the real deal and last a long time.  I have been drying my blades after every use as a result of advice from a tightwad on the radio, and I get at least two weeks from each blade.  I tried the subscription blades from the slick dude with the humorous videos, but they were sub-par.  These are great!",3
5,works great...very easy to use and clean. I have never tried this style for trimming nose hairs but I am very pleased with it. Edges well too.,3
5,"I needed this specific color & no local stores had it in stock. Plus, it was cheaper here on Amazon.<br />The product is top-notch if you need perm hair color that does not &#34;wash out&#34;, it will only grow out.<br />So choose wisely!",3
5,This peeling mask leaves my skin feeling fresh and soft. I like the way the oxygen bubbles feel as it's lifting dead skin cells.,3
4,Good product starting to see difference,3
5,"Luv it, good quality, 100% recommended it",3
5,Touch is awesome. They should have never discontinued this scent. I tested the others and they don't even come close to this scent.,3
5,"This is my first time using this product. I have very fine hair (lots of it)  and natural curl I am 44 years old and have tried just about everything out there Nothing has worked I heard of this product from a woman I work with so I figured what the heck I purchased the shampoo, conditioner and amplifier. THE RESULTS ARE AMAZING my hair is soft and the curl is unbelievable. I will definitely purchase this product again",3
5,It works great on my sensitive skins. I love its light and moist texture. Happy to find this product.<br />The package is broken when I open the box but fortunately the product is not affected.,3
5,"I have been using this cream for a few years and love it. I've tried a few others and always come back to this one. I have sensitive dry skin. This is definitely a CREAM and may be too thick for some people who are using to a lotion, but I love it. Wears well under makeup too.",3
5,It is a great mirror I use to pluck my eyebrows and look at something more closely. I also use it as a regular mirroras well as the magnified mirror. I'm suprised and happy it didn't crack when I dropped it. I was sure it was going to break.,3
5,View tips and guidelines | Star Rating required.,3
5,I bought this tool along with some others to do my own gel manicures and I have to say this tool is great quality! I would purchase again for sure!,3
4,OK,3
5,I have always loved Nivea moisturizers. This one has become my favorite. The packaging is great and the size makes it easy to carry along.,3
5,Easy and GREAT to use.  I purchased one for my mother.  She and I don't have to go to the shop and get our feet done,3
4,Beautiful color with lots of pigmentation. Goes on easy and very low odor. Only needs 1 coat. Very comparable to brand names like Gelish. Great buy! Wears for weeks!<br /><br />7/22/2015 UPDATE<br />I used the other color today and it wrinkled. was told that color was a bad batch. very disappointed!<br /><br />7/24/15 UPDATE<br />was refunded for the bad batch. great customer service,3
5,"I've been using this stuff for years. It was first suggested to me by my esthetician, after a bikini wax. Yes, it is expensive, but I decided to give it a shot. A little goes a long way, and I've gotten through 5 or 6 months with just one package. It resolved all of my ingrown hairs and has done a great job of preventing them. I stopped using this while I was pregnant, as advised by the manufacturer, and the ingrown hairs returned. I will be buying it again.",3
4,The Color Fixation Products Resorative Conditioner is very gentle for damaged or overprocessed hair. It leaves your hair soft and silky. I recommend it for all types of hair especially color treated hair.,3
5,I absolutely love this scent. It is clean and fresh and smells wonderful. I will purchase more. Best buy this year.,3
5,Great product,3
4,The price was the best since at a tanning salon they charge about $60.00 but my item came with a crack in it...minor problem,3
5.0,Thank you! It is great!,3
5,they make doing your nails so much easier. they slice throug the false nails like butter. The cost was well worth the purchas. I woudl definatly recomend this item,3
5.0,I love the rice oIL makeup remover. The wash wash is really good too. The wash smells really nice.,3
5,This mouthwash keeps my breathe fresh for hours and the fact that it is made of natural ingredients is another positive aspect of this product. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to stop using fluoride mouthwash and start using a more healthy alternative. I don't know if this will make my teeth stronger but I am falling in love with this mouthwash and I will buy again.,3
5,All the nail clipper you will ever need.  Feels comfortable and effortless after break-in period of a couple of trimmings.,3
5,"If you paint your own nails you must have a bottle of this.  How many times have you done your nails...and go to bed even several hours later...wake up to \\""sheet nails\\""???  WELL just paint this stuff on and it disappears.  I am not making this up!! and it dries in no time at all.  They also make another product called IN A SNAP that dries them oh so quickly.  Pick up this too!  Love the stuff!",3
4,I decided to get these after watching some reviews on YouTube. I'm still trying to get the hang of stamping; so I'm not not exactly good at it just yet. However; I really like the designs on these 3 plates. There was a scratch/flaw on plate A but it doesn't interfere with the design. For the price I think it's a good deal!,3
5,Great product!  Great Price.,3
5,"The product came to me well and on time, without any problem, I'm already using and it works perfectly, totally recommend.",3
5,"LOVE this scent. I don't like heavy perfume, so when I came across this I fell in love. It smells so good, fresh and clean~ If you like Philosophy scents, you'll love this!",3
5,"due to it's small bottle, though, it's tough to get product out to apply.<br />overall, i love the product and the results i see.  thanks.",3
5,"In the past I have used pureology products for dandruff and that was the only kind of shampoo that could keep the dandruff away for me. I used all the store bought brands and nothing else worked.  When pureology discontinued the line I was distraught since I hadn't been able to find anything else that worked. I found maple holistics and thought I would give it a try. Not only does it work, but it's not filled with harmful chemicals and I love the smell!  I am going to try more of their product line for sure. I also really like the fact that all their products are 100% guaranteed.  I got an email that said if it didn't work for me, that they would send me another product to try. Now that is customer service!",3
5,"Is pretty amazing, works fine for me, my hair is softer and shiny.",3
5,"I usually have one makeup obsession per summer and last summer it was finding the right eyeliner.  My eyeliners have always tended to smudge and run, until I come home from work only to find a horrified Alice Cooper type face looking back at me. I did some research by reading comments other women made on various websites that sell makeup and the Prestige name kept getting the thumbs up by users over and over again. I ordered this Prestige Mechanical Eye Pencil in Trance on Amazon, and I totally agree- it's the best eyeliner I've ever used.  I have brown eyes, but love to wear blue eyeliner sometimes, and this \\""Trance\\"" color is amazing. Since this order I've also bought black,  dark and light brown colors, and always in the mechanical type- no more sharpening issues for me.  You just twist it up and you're good to go.  And the price can't be beat, or at least can't be beat by much.  For me, this is the brand I plan to stick with- I get fantastic results because it stays in place all day.",3
5,"I have used this particular curling iron model for years.  It heats up very quickly, which is a plus when hurriedly getting ready for work!  It's also easy to control the heat setting with the push buttons, and the cord on this model doesn't tangle up.  I just bought another one on Amazon to keep in my luggage for business trips. For the money, a great value -- has a nice sleek look too!",3
4,"I've bought two different Clinique lipsticks in the past and the colors just weren't what I'd hoped for so I was a bit apprehensive when ordering this time. As it turns out, I must say I do like it.",3
5,"I am so happy to find an inexpensive, nice brush. Scalpmaster makes a good quality brush! Thank you so much!",3
5,I not only use it for my eyes.  I use it on my face.  I really like it.  It makes my faces feel replenished.  It doesn't feel greasy at all.  Smooths out surface wrinkles.,3
5,"I have been watching youtube videos and I learned about tightlining. I've also heard so many good things about sigma brushes, so I thought it would be perfect. I love it! I've had so much fun using this brush! I would for sure recommend this to anyone looking to try tightlining.",3
5.0,Tried it and liked it.  My dog wants one too. Will have to order another soon.,3
5,Legit.,3
5,this is one of the best lotions i have ever used. It goes on smooth and leaves your skin so soft and the fragrance is amazing.No need to wear perfume or any other scent while using this..this has a very lingering scent and it stays on all day.Dont let the price fool you.,3
4,"As a male stripper, smooth shaved cock and balls are important. Nothing looks worse than stubble or a bloody mess. This is easy enough for every day, but not as harsh as a wet shave.",3
5,"I bought these cases because I wanted a cute but efficient way to organize and store my make-up and various beauty products. I was amazed at the excellent quality and the size of these train cases! All sides, including the top, are hard and non-flexible: very sturdy. I can be sure that anything in a tube will be safe from any accidental squishing. In both cases there are several stretchy fabric loops on one side for holding lipsticks or mascara. The design is beautiful. The product description is very accurate.<br /><br />A nice thing that you can't see in the pictures is that on the bottom of both cases there are four plastic knobs, one at each corner, that they rest on when you set them down.<br /><br />I am extremely pleased with these train cases! This company has many different designs of this style of train cases to choose from and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a nice cosmetic case.",3
5,It's like bay rum with woodsy and leathery overtones.  Very nice and it lasts almost all day.  I recommend it highly.,3
5,"I highly recommend this product if you haven't given it a try i highly believe that any buyer will not be let down. Great service & excellant product, thank you to seller for well delivering it to me so quikly!",3
5,"I've always heard wonders about this top coat but I tried the smaller bottle first (15ml) and when I was blown away by how rapid it dries without smudging my nail art & how it adds this beautiful shine to my nails, I went for the big thing to make sure I always have back up... :)",3
5,"I purchased this at Walgreens for about $8. I'm only 24 so I don't know what the 'old barber shop smell' smells like. If it smells like what's in this bottle...then it smells good. If you take the top off and smell it right out of the bottle, yes, the scent is VERY strong. But once you apply it to yourself and let it dry, the smell \\""changes.\\"" It no longer has that super strong alcohol smell. The best way I found to find out what this really smells like if you're unsure what you'll smell like to others once it's dry (you'll get used to the smell so YOU won't be able to smell but but others will) is to let some of it spill on the bottle, let it dry then smell it. The product works very well. It has done a great job making my skin taught and oil free. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an aftershave or just to rub some on when you're ready to go out. The bottle will last you a pretty good while. - my shave: Edwin Jagger DE89 razor, Tweezerman badger shave brush, C.O. Bigelow (Proraso) shave cream and VDH Deluxe shave soap- thanks",3
5,"I was offered a promotional coupon to try this product in exchange for my unbiased opinion.<br /><br />I received the hair today. I am impressed with the quality of it. The hair is thick and lush, the color matches through-out the batch.<br /><br />The sewing looks sturdy and I did not notice shedding when I brushed it. The wave adds to the beauty of it. This hair is a very fair price for hair that is going to last with proper care. I love the fact that it comes in three lengths so it will make a beautiful layered look when woven in. The first thing I did was wash it and gently blow dry it.<br /><br />Real human hair is so much better than synthetic hair. I can wash this hair, use my hot rollers in it for extra curls, etc. When I am tired of having longer lush hair, I can remove it!<br /><br />Pros, the hair is true to length promised, is the color promised and the amount means this is a full head of hair. It doesn't appear to have been processed and the hair is strong. I am very pleased with the overall quality.<br /><br />Cons- I am not finding any but I will update it if it doesn't last.",3
4,I like it,3
5,"I love this product, I refill ever few months.  A little expensive but entirely worth it and is a great part of my make up collection.",3
4,"In comparing to the Sonicare, it got more power and I feel cleaner. Anyway, its brush head is small for me. Its handle is quite a bit big and heavier than some of the Sonicare models. I'm not sure how long its brush head will last. The Sonicare is designed to last for 1-2 months and they are not cheap to replace it.",3
5,love it,3
5,"This liner goes on your lips so smooth. You don't feel the need to retrace it too many times because the first time delivers a lot of color. I purchased the color \\""earth\\"" and it is natural enough but still vibrant. I also like that you don't have to sharpen it. Nice thin line.",3
5.0,"Good product.  Great for short, frizzy hair that needs to have sticking up ends cut off.",3
5,Just started using. Works great already noticing thinning hair in front to seem more full. Pretty pricey but would definitely recommend.,3
5,"This is a great mosurizer, I have been using this olay and the total olay mosurizer for over 10 years.",3
5,...over and above expectations for the price I paid.<br />Would love to see that price again. I'd get some for gifts...the lower price helping to make up for the high shipping because of weight.<br />Have ordered several of the globe style. Hope they are as nice as bowls.,3
5.0,Cute hair clips included :),3
5.0,Love this tanning oil. Doesn't make it so you feel oily and definitely gives you a nice bronze color.,3
4,"I have thin hair. It doesn't have many problems like oil or frizziness, but the shampoo doesn't work for me at all. The conditionerve works great!! The shampoo is just too much for my hair, leaves it as if I didn't wash it out. Disgusting. For thick hair for sure!",3
5,"i have bounced around among many different facial moisturizers, but this is now my go to product.  it is light, unscented, and doesn't make my eyes water.  a tube lasts me six months.  a real winner.",3
4,Delicious and easy to bake with. I found it was a bit clumpy as the only downside. Everything I baked came out tasting great.,3
5,It smells so good. My 3 year old step daughter calls it my magic spray because it makes it not hurt when I brush her hair,3
5,"I had been suffering from severe hair loss. There was hair all over my bathroom floor, pillow, and tonnes in my hair brush. In my case hair loss is a hereditary problem for men and women of my family.    I started using the shampoo and conditioner and I swear to god my hair completely stopped falling, in less than 2 weeks.    Now I have been using it for about 2 months, hair is actually growing back on my hairline! I keep the conditioner in my hair for like 1 min thats all. Even then its working. Good luck!!!",3
5,Beautiful,3
5,"First of all my order arrived very quickly and in perfect condition so I was pleased about that. I have only used one time so far because you have to wait every 5-7 days to use again. It was my first time using any kind of acid peel so I was a little nervous. I left it on for 1 minute and there was a slight tingling sensation, but nothing too bad. Immediately after rinsing off product, I noticed how smooth and soft my face was. I'm very excited to use next week to see more results.",3
5,"Muguet des Bois by Coty has been my favorite fragrance for decades -- my first and constant favorite. Lily of the Valley is my favorite flower.<br /><br />Other brands have created less-satisfying versions, with an off or edgy tone, or which turns 'sour' after a few hours of wearing...<br /><br />Muguet des Bois by Coty is always fresh, sweet, delightful, and I am so pleased to be able to find it here, as I always order it in multiples. I am thankful and appreciative.",3
4,My son like it.,3
4,"I don't think it quite restores youth - ha! - but it does feel good on and makes a good substitute for some other &#34;night cream,&#34; I think. Considering the lofty price, it's very important that a little goes a long way, or seems to, and only on that basis would I buy another.",3
5,Great product... I've used it for over 3 years.  I would strongly recommend it as a replacement for some of the name brand after shave lotions.,3
5,This is the first wig I ever bought and it was worth the money. Because it was my first one I didn't realize what a pain it is to keep it tangle free because of the length. So if you don't want to deal with that don't get such a long wig. The quality is excellent and really does look very real. Shipped in less than two days. If I want another wig I will buy from this seller without a second thought.,3
4,Great product - only need to straighten your hair once and it will remain an entire week or until you need to wash it.,3
5,I LOVE LIZ CLAIBORNE FOR YEARS  THE PRICE HERE IS GREAT THANK YOU,3
5,I hunted all over the web looking for a reasonable priced clothes brush so I was very<br />pleased to find one.,3
4,The service was excellent and the product was as described - I only give it 4 stars because the product name my skin break out. :(,3
5,"Some of the shadows can shed off the brush, but since I love the natural Look, I dampen my brush to apply.<br />Great tip.<br />I am Latina, I love the blended look when I apply three colors on my lids. My hair is a light brown with highlights, the colors are excellent combo with my skin tone.<br />Love the product. Will order more.<br />Yoli from Texas",3
4,"I  have been using this product for little over a month now and I think it was work the $180 investment.<br /><br />Pros: I did notice my teeth getting whiter, the travel case is really nice, since the first charge I had to do I haven't had to recharge mine yet so battery life is working great, there are quite a few different brush setting from polish, sensitive, whitening and they all very in brush time.<br /><br />Cons: It does take some getting used to the vibration of the brushing, the charging cup is a little big so I store it in the closet in my bathroom so its not taking up counter space.",3
5,Loved it!,3
4,"Nice product, like the coolness when applied. A little goes a LONG way, dont over use otherwise it tends to get sticky and crease...takes away puffiness and fine lines, gives eyes a bright look.",3
5,My hair has been thinning and I find taking Matrix 5000 has helped,3
5,I really like this hair spray. It holds hair in place but still allows some movement so hair looks natural.,3
5,"My hair is porous, so I couldn't use the purple cellophane product, but the product is really great generally if you don't have that problem.  Fast delivery and great seller.",3
5,"I especially liked that it wasn't greasy but, moisturized well.Great to use when mixing other Dermalogica products--like the night serum and the map 15.",3
5,Perfect for French manicure tips.,3
5,"I will never go back to disposable razors again.  These leave me with a nicer shave, less razors bumps, and for a heck of a lot less money.  Also, it's retro factor is pretty awesome.<br /><br />Cleans easily, still looks new even after a year!",3
5,"This fragrance is without a doubt the cleanest and most pleasant smelling fragrance I have ever used. I read somewhere that it was being discontinued and I can't imagine why! Is it because not enough people are buying the fragrance? Please give second thoughts to doing away with this most beautiful fragrant perfume. It would be well worth your while to promote it again and continue issuing this lovely, sweet smelling perfume and pay attention to the people that really want it to be continued as I feel you would make a fortune just considering that aspect alone. Rose Marie",3
5.0,This is my favorite light and natural looking blush and has been for 10 years. Easy application with the brush and tray inside. I always go back to this one.,3
5,My husband has one and I decided I needed one for clipping the cat's nails. It is so sharp it makes that job easy. Amazing how much better this is than the cheap one I was using.,3
5,"I like Braun cleaning system.  I got my shaver about 2 month ago.  Just finished my first cartridge and installed the new one.  Things cannot be simpler - open up the cleaning station, slide out the old one, open and slide in the new one.  I like the fact that the Braun system is alcohol based - makes the shaver smell nice when clean.",3
5,Just wanted to say I love the eye shadows. My mom bought this set and it just wasn't for her. I took her comment off! I love the colors they go great with my skin tone!!!also great customer relations wasn't expecting such a nice call to try and fix the comment. Great business,3
4,"Loved it! It works very well and does the job right. Very soft tip with easy switch. It is a little vintage looking in the fact it's a little bit bulky but many don't know the difference. Also, the seeing is a good medium... Just enough juice 😉",3
5,"I absolutely love this product. I bought it on a whim after running out of moisturizer and this did a perfect job. I am totally hooked. After only using it for a few days I saw a noticeable difference in the softness and the tone overall. It has a thick luxurious feel to it, but my face absorbs it within minutes. It even makes my makeup go on better. I am almost at the bottom of my first jar, and I have to say i swear by it already. I have pretty normal skin, medium- dark complexion and this just brightens up my face, all dullness was gone within days of using. Love love love it. It does have a strong citrus scent to it (which i love) but it did take a few days to get used to. My fiance loves that i smell \\""orange fresh\\"" :)<br />Usually in the evening i put on a layer and wait for my skin to absorb it and then put on another layer right before bed and come morning my skin feels refreshed and still moisturized (which i haven't been able to do with any other products, come morning my face was feeling dry and in need of moisture).",3
5,Everything was exactly as described! I received my shipment fast! I cant stop using my tools and I get great results! Im looking forward to purchasing the bigger flat iron for longer hair.,3
5.0,"I have melasma and some acne scarring.  I have had chemical peels, laser treatments and I have tried everything.  I use a little all over my face every morning and night.  I have received many compliments on how great my skin looks.  How soft it is, how the melasma is fading, and how the scars are fading too and it doesn't make my face look greasy at all.<br />Great product.",3
5,Great Product! Definitely gained about 10lbs of bulk in a couple weeks. Bench went from 310-340. Arms grew half of an inch. Still have one more week to go. Great when stacked with pre-workout and creatine.,3
5,This is a must-have if you're into sheet masks. Keeps all the masks from drying too quickly and keeps them in place. It is made of silicon and it is easy to clean and re-use.,3
5,"I have tried so many spiking gels that I've lost count. When my stylist used the hard head at one of my visits, I went right to amazon and ordered some. Its not gooey or stringy and it doesn't clump your hair into separate globs. In other words it works just like it should. I put some on my hands and add a few drops of water, rub my hands together and run it through my hair from the roots out and it spikes perfectly. It lasts a long time but I've added the bed head hair spray recently and it stays perfect my whole 12 hour work shift, and wind can not touch the stuff. I love it but as stiff as it gets I would not recommend trying to brush it out \\""ouch\\"".",3
5,Great product that I use daily as a moisturizer.  Will be ordering again.  Good price too.,3
5.0,"Necessary and right. Nt out together super cheap, it's made right.",3
4,"This is a good deal buying in bulk, because one tube is very expensive.  The only thing is it takes some time to receive this item.",3
4.0,Smells like a cross between Irish spring and vetiver Mistral soaps. Nice scent. Decent soap,3
5,"Love these night guards.  I almost feels like you are not wearing one, compared to the &#34;football&#34; ones you buy at Walmart.  Easy to prepare, and so comfortable.  I kept the first one for months and months, until I finally bit through it.  Guess jaw power is hefty.  I'll keep ordering when needed, because the comfort is worth it.",3
5,Awesome formula love it!,3
5,"I had read the reviews of previous people who had already purchased this product.  Because of their favorable reviews I also purchased this product with positive results.  It is easy to use and really cleans deep into the pores.  I am happy with this facial cleanser and would buy it again.  I recommend this product to friends and family.  I have not had experience with any other similar item, but I feel this skin care system fulfills its claims and does a nice job.",3
5,"just as many of the other reviews state, the color shown, is not how it looks on.. but since I wanted a  very dark, deep red / maroon, it is perfect…  for that, but definitely does not look like the color shown (which is how it looks in person)…. when on the lips.",3
5.0,these are the size I was needing and work well keeping hair up off my neck while it grows out.,3
5,"The mint is pleasant, the lip balm feels nice to wear, and it lasts quite a while.  I would recommend this as a glossy lip balm.",3
5,I love this also.,3
5,"Great stuff for the mornings when your hair really doesn't want to cooperate. First time I used this I immediately got compliments. Solid purchase, will be back for more",3
5,I love this brand of witch hazel. It is part of my daily skin routine and it's really helped make my skin look better and also hydrate my skin during this very hot summer.,3
4,I like this product a lot. It is much better than the Mary Kay Oil Control Lotion. Using this product will provide a powdered /no shine result especially if you blot before applying. It allowed me to go from blotting 10-12 times a day to 4-5 times instead. For someone with really oily skin this product will help reduce shine for the whole day - especially if you re-apply mid-day. After about 6-8 months of daily use i found it wasn't as effective so a user may need to take a 1-2 month break then continue use to maintain the same level of effectiveness.,3
5.0,This was a gift for my teen Grand-daughter. She has never been so excited over a hair care item as she has been with this one. A real winner!,3
5.0,"Great product. Like everything. Don't really think the foam would be sufficent to protect though. However, used this in addition to aquafor and healed up nicely. Very good product.",3
5.0,Lovely easy to use oil that seems easily absorbed and light not oily looking. I don't know what to expect but I have. A few face oils and this seems to  barely have a smell and goes on so nicely. Love the dropper and the bottle size and product quantity. The supplier did send an an email to advise on it use which was also a nice touch. Plus is organ and extra virgin. A good deal.,3
5,"I am extremely happy with the seller, the transaction, and the quality of the product. It does have many uses, but so far I have only used in the making of my own pre shave lotion. Good product, excellent seller.",3
5,"A classic cologne never fails, long lasting cologne the best!",3
5,I was scared because this was the first time I've bought lashes of Amazon but I am extremely happy with these. I've use one pair so far and they have lasted 2 weeks already. 💕,3
5,I have been using this shea butter for years and it works like magic.<br />Highly recommend it for anyone. Enjoy!,3
5,Excellent wear. Remained looking good for over a week.,3
5,Great product and delivery!,3
5,best sunscreen ever,3
5,Love it,3
5,Package arrived as promised and I love this product for all around lip care because it has the 45 SPF.,3
5.0,Love this stuff!!  It is a true copper red!,3
5,My favorite Axe,3
5,"Makes hair very soft , I left it in long than the direction suggested .",3
5,Very cute ! I ordered two of these in different colors. Keeps my head very warm and I love the design.,3
4,My hair felt moisturized.  Made it easy to detangle.  Not heavy or sticky.  I will be using this product a lot!,3
5,mmmm....,3
4,These really do make your lashes look better! Love them.,3
5,This is an excellent product.  This is my second time purchase these strips but the first time in this quantity.  The only problem I have with this package is that it did not include the instructions on how often to use the strips.  I wasn't sure if I needed to use them daily for number of days until they were all gone of just use them up to 7 days like their other strips.,3
5,Ihad one of these and moving the charger was lost having satifaction using this I purchased the same one and still are satified,3
5,Good! But I'm looking for Sanogil toothpaste too.,3
5,"Since I have been using Periowash, my dentist has noticed a huge improvement in the condition of my gum tissue. I buy this on a regular basis & use it twice a day. The winter I t flavor is the only one I've ever bought & it tastes good.",3
4,"Stumbled on this here in my endless quest to find a cleanser that both gets off makeup and cleans well, and doesn't irritate my super sensitive skin. In a million years I wouldn't see myself as a Mary Kay product person (seemed like a corny old ladyish line), but I was really wrong and I am admitting it.<br /><br />I don't like that there is paraben in the product, but it's low on the list of ingredients and in any event you do wash the stuff off, and the rest of the ingredients are impressive. (I have been following my cleaning with this some Weleda Almond Cleanser afterward because it's very soothing.)<br /><br />The cleanser comes out of the tube in a nice marshmallow like consistency, but when you apply and wet it, it gets milky, not really too lather-y. My skin felt clean after, not annoyed and not too tight. The best part was the next day waking up and my skin not looking bumpy and red which it will if the product doesn't agree with my skin.<br /><br />In case anyone is interested (I was) her is the ingredient list:<br /><br />NORMAL TO DRY<br /><br />Ingredients:  Water, mineral oil, glycerin, petrolatum, bentonite, cetyle PEG/PPG-10/1 dimethicone, ethyhexyl pelargonate, neopentyl glycol diethylhexanoate, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, myristyl myristate, PPG-26-buteth-26, sorbitol, sucrose distearate, PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil, oleyl oleate, camellia ssinensis extract, chamomile extract, cucumber extract, camellia oleifera extract, hibiscus rosa-sinensis extract, malva sylvestris (Mallow) extract, echinacea purpurea extract, solanum lycopersicum (Tomato) extract, triethanolamine, sucrose stearate, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, carbomer, disodium EDTA, magnesium almunium silicate, diazolidinyl urea, tocopherol, carnauba wax, mannitol, methylparaben, cellulose, propylparaben, C9-15 alkyl phospahte, lauramine oxide, phenoxyethanol, thermus thermophillus ferment, ethyl linoleate, ethyl linolenate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, tetradibutyl penaerithrityl  hydroxyhydrocinnamate, talc, red 7, red 4, titanium dioxide, red 30, ultramarines, red 33.roxyhydrocinnamate, talc, red 7, red 4, titanium dioxide, red 30, ultramarines, red 33.",3
5,This is a great comb. I like the rounded tips and the instructions for inserting the comb (a slightly different way than the pointy-tipped types). It results in a twist that's just as tight but with less pulling. It's pretty too.,3
5,This is the only mousse that makes my hair not crunchy but can control my hair and not be frizzy.,3
5,"In my younger days I would use vitamin E on my face all the time; back then I would take a vitamin e gel cap & squeeze out the liquid. This is, in one word  AWESOME - they're not kidding when that say it's an INTENSE MOISTURIZER....It's creamy & luscious and my skin soaks it up!  I stopped using all the high priced &#34;wrinkle&#34; creams and lotions I bath in and have been using this along with the Vitamin E Sink-In Moisture mask for 10 days now & I am AMAZED AND THRILLED at the results.  We can't actually turn back time but I sure in heck can look like I have ...",3
5,Best soap for sensitive skin I ever found. Been using it for years and years. No annoying fragrance or irritants. If only I could find a shampoo this good.,3
5,"This has a lot of great stuff in it, green tea, sage, vitamin E, jojoba oil, lavender, lemon, witch hazel, and rosemary! It has a faint smell, it reminds me of Chai tea, probably comes from all those herbs and the green tea.<br /><br />It comes in a plastic tube with an airtight pump, and the serum itself is a thick-ish gel, I use two pumps for my whole face, and it spreads out very nicely. It doesn’t take very long to dry, and there’s no sticky feeling left over. It leaves my skin feeling very soft and refreshed, I’ve been really liking it in my evening routine! The bottle has 1 oz, but since I only need a little bit for each use, this will last me quite a while. I thought the cursive logo was cute, usually skincare packaging is pretty blah!<br /><br />I was sent this serum in exchange for my honest review.",3
5,Finally found something with moisturizer and easy to remove I hope they do not stop making this product the best ever,3
5,Worked well for me. Just like others have mentioned. I have ordered one more. Undoubtedly one of the most effective items.,3
4,"This worked great for me. I purchased it in a hurry before heading to Ireland for a 2-week business trip. I had converted to the \\""old fashioned\\"" way of shaving last year but this was the first time I was going on a long trip.  This was the perfect travel shaving soap and case!  Most importantly, it isn't throw-away.  The 2.25 ounce Col. Conk soaps fit perfectly in this (and that's exactly what comes with this case).  While I was hoping for a different scent (and would have liked the option to pick which), the one I received was lime and I have grown to like it.  In the end, I would recommend this to anyone that needs shaving soap on the go.",3
5,Old Norelco broke down after 10 ten years. 7180XL is much lighter and smoother shave. It is stylish and easy to handle.,3
5,Item arrived quick and was as promised in the description. Works pretty good although hard to maneuver just at first.,3
5,"This is a great little diffuser, runs for 4-6 hours on a fill, and is great with essential oils.  It can change lights automatically for color or you can select single color.  Nice quality, works great, I would recommend for the price!",3
5,"I use it on my hair and skin. As a black woman, my hair can be quite dry. This makes it soft and glossy without being oily. It smells great on my skin. The shipping was prompt and neat. I will be a repeat customer.",3
5,"I actually have 2 of these.  It does a great job in drying, styling, and making my hair shiny.  Ceramic barrel works well in taming hair.<br /><br />My only pet peeve is that if my hand slips a little, b/c my hand is a bit small for the barrel, I'll accidentally turn it off b/c my hand will slide the wrong way.  Would be nice if they put the buttons somewhere my hands wouldn't touch when styling.",3
4,These blades work very well for beginners and pros alike. They're sharp enough to last 5-7 shaves and they work well on any type of razor.,3
5.0,I love my pick. I can't stand the plastic ones. They give me to much electricity in my hair and this wooden one doesn't. I love it.,3
5,"Perfect, exactly what I was looking for. :-)",3
5,Nice oil~,3
5,nice scent,3
5,"Amazing color and variety! Just as good as the big name brands, but better price. Color goes on smooth and stays put all day.",3
5,"This is the BEST gel I have ever used.  I keep it by the stove for quick first aid if any burns occur like those nasty little grease splashes from frying foods.  This gel calms the burn immediately and there is hardly any pain afterward,",3
4,I did like this eyeliner and probably will buy again.  I did not bother my eyelids like most other products.  No allergic reaction.  Good product.,3
5,Much cheaper from Amazon than purchasing at local mega-store. The new blades shave much closer than the one-year old one did.,3
4,"Is another good guard to have, but I did have trouble snapping it on a couple times. Does not seem to be a 100% perfect fit for my wahl chrome pros but does do the job.",3
5,"I have gone through many nightgaurds. This is an updated version of one I have chewed through or not liked due to fit or bulkiness. The newest version is less bulky, a tad longer in the back which is good for me since I have a lot of teeth and it doesn't require you to boil water. You just need to microwave water in a mug. Now I'm a serious grinder. I know this isn't gonna last me probably more than a year. However, I can't afford the amount of money the dentist charges for a legit night gaurd. So, of all the drugstore options this is the one I choose every time I inevitably chew threw them. My teeth are worn down and my K9s are flat so going without one isn't an option. I had a lapse for a few weeks and it was painful. I just can't do it like I did when I was younger. I wish I had of had this when I was a kid! My teeth would have a lot more edges on them.",3
4,I was given a sample of Secret Outlast Gel Deodorant by BzzAgent in return for a test of the product and review. I must say I was pleasantly surprised how it went on smooth with no streaking and dryed quickly. it does have a faint but pleasant scent that is not overpowering. It worked well even during my morning spin class and weekly softball games where other deodorants I have used in the past could not keep up with my active lifestyle. Secret Outlast Gel will now be a regular in my gym bag.,3
5.0,The picture does not do it justice. This is so beautiful in real life!,3
5,I try different bath salts all the time. This was the first time I tried this company/product. These salts are definitely top of the line and will definitely order again!,3
5.0,excellent TY,3
5,"I have been using Avon products since the late 1980s. The only reason I ordered it is because it is hard to find someone who sells Avon. As always, I am pleased with the product and I would not change anything.",3
5,This is the only tanning lotion I will use. It leaves your skin feeling soooo soft. And I love the way it smells. Gives you a great pure tan without all the nasty bronzers.,3
5,absolutely love these nails! had to trim them down because they were a bit long and wide but other than that they're fantastic!!,3
5,"Exceptional. Just below Helan Vettiver and Rum shower gel and shampoo, which is nearly impossible to find",3
5,"We've used Young Living for years but with using it at home and diffusing it daily in my classroom the price was just too steep to continue buying it.  I tried this brand and am pleased to say that it seems to work just as well and smells identical when diffused - in the bottle it has a slightly different smell then Young Living Theives, I would say that Eden's Garden uses more Eucalyptus in their blend.  Diffused though I can't tell the difference between the two.  Otherwise for topical applications we have noticed no difference between this and Young Living brand when it comes to quality.  We will continue to buy Eden's Garden and I am eager to try the other blends.<br /><br />I would also like to add that as a family we do not ingest essential oils and I do not believe in ingesting them so for us the extra cost involved in purchasing brands like Young Living and DoTerra that claim they can be ingested is not worth it.",3
5,My pregnant wife uses this and she's been using it ever since she was 2 months pregnant<br /><br />Touch wood until now she does not have 1 stretch mark<br /><br />Good value<br /><br />Lasts for a long time<br />Use it immediately after showering and before bed,3
5,"Great product, easy to use and get used to. Great price. I would recommend this product to anyone interested in keeping their teeth clean,",3
5.0,Could not be more satisfied with this purchase. I only use the SmartKlean and no other washer or dryer products.,3
5,just what i was looking for,3
5,"I can't say anything more than I am IN LOVE with this Lipstick! I won't wear anything else, so 100% two thumbs up and was delighted to find it here on Amazon!!",3
5,good value,3
5,"Always makes the husband happy when I buy this for him! Great product, was a little concerned at first but it is good stuff!",3
4,I'm pretty new to indoor tanning. I've only tried this and Monarchy. I love the anti-aging and skin firming ingredients in this lotion. It helped me to get a good beginning tan for my first few times. The smell afterwards isn't bad.. it does have a little bit of that tanning smell though. I am super pleased with the seller. Super fast shipping. Two days! I'm really excited to use my bottle up (at half the price of tanning Salons)! More reviews later.,3
5,"I bought the portable waterpik so I wouldn't have another product sitting on my bathroom counter and yet another thing that needed to be plugged in (after the toothbrush, radio, curling iron, etc.) Also, I didn't like the feeling of the waterpik on a tether, attached to the water reservoire, it can feel awkward.  I keep the cordless one stored under the sink.  It keeps a charge for a remarkable length of time -- I only need to charge it every few weeks & do so overnight and then I put the cord away until I need it again.  It holds enough water for a quick once-over but I often fill it a second time to spend more time in certain problem areas I have.  This is not a big deal -- it's so easy to refill, takes about 10 seconds.  My gums have improved dramatically.  I add some sensodyne mouthwash to the water and that has helped too.  I much prefer using the cordless waterpik to flossing with floss.  It's a really good product.",3
5,Love it,3
5,"This is an excellent brush set!  Reviewer did not purchase her set from Yellow & unfortunately, did not get an authentic M.A.C. set.  Our wholesaler is an authorized dealer of overstock 100% genuine name brand cosmetics from department stores, boutiques & specialty stores that are shelf pulls of &#34;old stock,&#34; limited editions, seasonal, discontinued or imperfect/slightly irregular outlet stock.",3
4,Love this brand. Referred to me by a friend and I love the way it smells and detangals my hair. Out of other organic brands I've used I feel this one actually cleans the hair unlike some others but still does not weigh it down.  I'll buy the bigger bottle next time.,3
5,I have been wearing it for years love it,3
5,Good,3
5,"I have been using this product for a number of years and won't use anything else.  It is the best mascara I have EVER used.  It stays on until you take it off with water.  You simply get your lashes wet and the mascara comes off in tubes - no smearing, no need for eye makeup remover, nothing.  Just water.",3
5,"It is great to see a product created by a well known doctor with a focus on creating healthy, organic options for fighting hair loss and strengthening hair follicles. I have been using the line for a good 3 months now and could not be happier with the results. I avoid chemicals which can be harmful and cause damage, so this is a great all natural alternative.",3
5,"great eyelashes, very lite, look great :-)",3
5,"The finish on this polish is beautiful, especially in daylight.  It also makes a nice final coat to give any color polish some sparkle.  Lots of life - very pretty.",3
5,excellent,3
5,Good product,3
5.0,Mother's Day gift for my daughter in law! She loves the set! Very good value!,3
4,"I have only used the cream a few nights so I don't expect to see a difference. It is a very thick cream, but not to thick. It does feel nice on the skin. I don't care for the smell.  I do prefer a serum .  But if you have really dry skin, you might enjoy this over a serum..",3
5,Smells good and lasts me all day long.,3
5.0,I like it.,3
5,"I keep this on hand, my daughter and I use it every day. Amazon is the only place I buy it from I couldn't be more pleased with the service and price.  Thank you",3
4,"I like this dryer with the two attachments,however, it is travel size which I didn't know when I ordered it. being close to the holidays,it also took 4/5days instead of 2 to ship w Amazon prime membership.the dryer works great given its size so I will keep it.just know the dryer and attachments are smaller/travel size when purchasing",3
5,I am 56 years old and Oculift eye serum is the best. It only takes a small amount for both eyes. It moisturizes without being greasy like a lot of eye creams and serums. I have noticed a definite decrease in wrinkles and lines around my eyes.,3
4,"I do find that it smells as bad as the acetone nail polish remover. I am honestly not sure what the difference is between acetone and acetate, which this product contains. But it does remove nail polish nicely.",3
5.0,A very good foundation! This one is a favorite of mine. It can be full coverage and it stays on great!,3
5,Good product.,3
4,"This is helping with a fungi I have for some time now, where it seems that nothing was working this is helping.",3
5,i didn't  use it until now but i hope it help my body slim,3
5,"Bought it for my wife at Christmas.<br />  It works well & has a lot of nice features.  She said she needed to get a little better with it, but for a flat iron she is very well pleased.",3
5,I just received my Oder it was a fast delivery the hair is beautiful just like the photo it's soft and real good quality of hair I recommend everyone to by from this company they deliver  what they show u pictures coming soon 5 stars can't wait to order again thank you,3
5,This is a wonderful product.  I use a very small amount as a daily hair dressing.  It gives my hair a healthy shine-- but never greasy-looking.  There is nothing on the market that can compare with Vitapointe.,3
5,"This shampoo and conditioner set are awesome.  After, I had my LO my hair was starting to thin and fall out.  This product has helped so much! Plus it gives my hair a little volume! I was able to purchase this product through a discount but I am so glad I tried it.",3
5,"Good product, all natural good for the hair not like the ones they use in hair salons . Fast shipping, all you could want from a hair paint",3
4,"Both the &#34;Ct. (Rica 2)&#34; and the picture led me to believe that this comes in a quantity of two...and it doesn't. I liked the product a lot though! It's very small, cute and easy to pack away.",3
5.0,"I just tried this for the first time. It dries my very porous (usually long drying) hair super fast! And it creates amazing lift at the crown. My hair is naturally wavy and curly with even some parts kind of straight, very multi-textured. It worked really well. I was able to wear it natural with only adding a few curls on the top to even the pattern, not create volume - the hair dryer did that!  So, finally a hair dryer to love! And I got it on clearance at a local chain department store.",3
4,"Since I moved to a different area, I have been cutting my own hair.  I keep it very short (with clippers), but I don't like the &#34;fuzzy&#34; look it gets when it grows out some.  The girl that used to cut my hair used one of these razors to razor the top a little which seemed to make it look a little nicer.  So, I thought I'd give it a try.  This razor is very easy to use (I just lightly go over the top/upper sides of my head, and it gives my hair a little more texture and a less &#34;shaved&#34; look.",3
5,"This was the first flat iron I bought that worked on my extremely curly coarse red hair (imagine Macy Gray and Carrot Top having kids).  I bought this iron in 2002 and it is just now starting to wear out...12 years later!!  When I straighten my hair, it's hard to believe I have curly hair at all.  I've used this when my hair was just a couple of inches long, as well as below shoulder length.  It has never pulled my hair.  It has blades with curved edges so you can put a soft curl at the end of your hair.  The only problem I'm starting to have now is that the cord I think is shorting out, either from storing it wrapped around the iron or from the swiveled end.  I always use it at 400 degrees and it has never burned my hair.  So happy to see it is still available, as I will buy it again anyway over a CHI or other brand name.",3
5,"I have been wearing makeup for about 30 years, but could not wear mascara without my eyes getting itchy and red.  I've tried so many and just about gave up, but a contact lens wearer told me about blinc and said it is the only mascara she can wear without irritating her contacts.  It really is true, and I won't waste time with any other mascara now.",3
5,I was kind of iffy about ordering from the site since it was being sold for such a good price. And my friends sometimes get things from other amazon sellers that are not what are said to be. But I was so happy that exactly what was described is what I got. And YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE!!!  Great product.,3
5,"I bought this item to replace another SONICARE product. This brand is very good, and I like the &#34;2 minute timer&#34; associated with each usage.",3
5,"usually I have this balm in winter to keep my lip wet. I like the scent and the flavor, definately keep one in winter!",3
5,"Lipogaine for Men is just so amazing. It definitely worked for me, hands down. Highly recommended to you guys. I'm still a young 21 y/o guy and began thinning and falling my hair since I was 14 as far as I can remember; tried many products too and didn't work. As a standalone use, it may be enough to stop hairfall and thinning, it also promotes new growth. But if you want faster and more stable results, I also recommend to take supplements with it. Am using Hairomega :) Good luck to you guys!!",3
5,"my kids using this product  during 4 yeas already, it  helps.",3
4,"I sing in a chorus and these help me keep my voice sounding great.<br />They taste a little weird, but not too bad.  They stick to my gum under my upper lip and i just keep them there<br />and let them melt away while i'm singing.",3
5,"I purchased this protective spray after I bought a curling wand.  I only used one other heat protective spray, but I really like this one.  The other spray I used made my hair feel a little sticky, but this spray is smooth and silky.  It smells great, too.",3
5,I have been lookibg for this and thot it wasn't made any more. It is exactly what I remeber and I love it!,3
5,"Fantastic product. Light weight,non greasy, you only need to use a tiny bit to cover a large area. Great sunblock without the harsh chemicals. I will be stocking up as I use it everyday on my face and arms.",3
5,"Great daily moisturizer for feet and hands ! And it smells awesome too . It's not just a cheap, good smelling lotion that does nothing - it actually makes my skin nice and everything.",3
5,If you want to refresh your color in between salon visits..especially when your color oxidizes...this is the product! A little goes a long way and wear gloves.,3
4,"The Braun Series 5 did not disappoint, it works great on your skin and lets you have a smooth look in the morning. The thing I liked the most about this is its cleaning system, you just press a button and it cleans itself up.",3
5,"This has been my absolute favorite color for years.  I hope L'Oreal brings it back. Until then, I am thrilled to have been able to find some through Amazon",3
5,"For the price especially, this is a quality product. After tossing others in the bin for being too dry, for smearing on my upper lids, for being generally unsatisfactory, I always go back to this one. Prefer the straight brush to the curved, but that's just personal preference. It is easier to use, at least for me. Excellent value. Just ordered a bundle of three from Amazon.",3
4.0,"This product is especially great on arms and legs. It gives a true tan color. I have to be more careful on my face, so I use less of it for facial use.",3
5,amezing its very good i get this product  for give to somebody and i see the amezing change the person who i give too its more aprochable and  more happy around  woman  so i do recomend this products its very very good,3
5,Was just what I expected.,3
5,Great stuff.  Been using for about ten years but has been discontinued.  I was lucky to find some at a price less than most asking.  Hope I bought enough to last a long time because I won't likely find any more.,3
5,"These immediately cooled and soothed my tired, dancin' feet!  And they are super soft, too!  I hope the shea and vanilla really do last through several washings.",3
4,"Crappy plastic, but it does the job well.  I recommend waiting til your little one is asleep! Stupid word minimum.",3
4,It works like they said & is helpful with arthritis.,3
4,"Works pretty well.i've been staying away from the &#34;all-in-one&#34; trimmers and more toward single purpose trimmer.So how does it work? I stick it in my nose or in my ears and it makes this crunching sound. Then by the wonders of science i don't have long hairs sticking out anymore. Are you gonna use this on your pubes or to shave team logos into your hair? No. You can rinse it off in the water and its good to go.  Seems to be holding up pretty good, have not had issues with it pulling my hair like a sissy",3
5,My Daughter loved the colors. easy to apply. goes on smooth and stays on for a long amount of time. it came in on time and didn't receive any broken.my daughter is very pleased about this product.,3
5,I was afraid at first that at such a low price the razors would be inferior. But not in the least. These are of the same quality that I was paying so much more for at the market. I added them to my subscribed items and I don't have to worrying about not having a fresh razor.,3
5,I love this.  I received a pretty serious burn from propane a couple months ago.  It is partially healed up but very dry.  This helps quite a bit.  Arrived quickly and in good condition.,3
5,Beautiful peacock perfume bottle which looks good on display and is functional too. Very well made and a great price also. Good service from the seller too.,3
5,"I researched white strips carefully before buying them. I used the strips exactly as the directions called for. I had no problems getting them to attach to my teeth. After 21 days, my teeth are much whiter and I am very happy with the product. They were worth the money.",3
4,"2 stars for the cleaning system, cuz THere is a difference than braun 5790 cleaning system. (finally a cleaning that actually works!)    One star for the trimmer that also \\""quite\\"" works, a better than trimmer in braun 5790 that never worked, however still not perfect.    However, first thing one look for in a shaver is how good is it at shaving. This one is no better at shaving than braun 5790. The hair that braun 5790 could not get on my neck, braun 7526 is not better..    Anyway, for me, Braun 7526 does better job in shaving than Gillette M3Power. (I have thick dense beard, I need to shave everyday, and I still need to shave everyday, however, with Gillette M3Power, in the afternoon I had my beard grown again. now with Braun 7526, I have a closer shave, and it takes till next morning so my beard grows again). One star is added here.    two years ago, I bought from bestbuy braun 5790 with replacement plan (only $10 for a two year replacement plan). B4 the two years ended, I took advantage of the replacement plan and got braun 7526, thinking it would be a far better upgrade. (not up to my expectations as an upgrade in shaving).    5790 to 7526, u would think there is a lot of changes and improvements, but not really!",3
5,Great citrus smelling and great cleaning.  I also love that it's sulphate-free.  I use this in combination with the conditioner too.,3
5,This is the best price I have found on these brushes.I like my clarisonic but didn't like the prices on the brushes most retail want 25$ for just one brush can't beat this 2 for almost the price of one.,3
5,"This is the best kit I have tried. The cups can fall 6\\"" onto tile flooring and dont break, and can handle boiling for cleaning. The pump is high quality and develops a lot of vacuum. I have, and would again recommend this kit. NOT some knockoff junk. Has been tremendous in healing chronic pain that was years old. Five stars. Oh yeah, ot has an awesome case too.",3
5,"I have very thick hair and suavecito firme is the only water based pomade that will keep it in place. I've used it to style several hairstyles, from a pomp to a combover. As far as the scent, I love it.",3
5,"I love this color. I'm not a fan of change especially when I use the same product for years. But this color is great! I love the way it blends into my lips and brings out the rest of my face, night or day look. I was a little uncomfortable buying a lip gloss online without seeing what it looks like in person, but I love my new lip gloss.",3
5,"I have also been on the search for what feels like my whole life to find a natural deo that actually works. I had resigned to using old spice for the last 4 years (I actually sweat and I actually smell) but decided to start the search again. After reading reviews I tried this one and my friends don't believe me when I say I've found THE ONE.<br /><br />You must have clean pits for it to work, so I put it on after I shower in the morning and again at night before I go to bed if I want to squeeze another day out of it.<br /><br />I have the jar which is fine, but over time it seems like it's solidified more (perhaps with air exposure), and thus compacted quite a bit. Not unhappy, just curious.<br /><br />I'm deodomom all the way",3
4,"Its a pretty good perfume. Smelled like honeysuckle on me at first, but then turned in to a powdery scent; I absolutely hate powdery perfumes. So I let my mom have it and she loves it.",3
4,"I still have to use this, it rests in the refrigerater.  Lemon balm is the traditional herbal treatment for cold sores. I've used<br />lemon balm before for this and it seemed to work for me",3
5,All I can say is that this hair clipper is excellent.  It supersedes others I have tried recently. I particularly like the T shape blade because it get corners and curves that you ordinarily need special skills to manicure. I love it also because it is steady and quick. I would recommend it highly. its a five star product without question.,3
5,"I did not know a product like this existed, until I had a painful nail and started researching for cures!",3
5.0,I am amazed at the workmanship of this mirror compact! The double mirrors are beautifully set into a work of art!  The packaging is well done. I ordered one of this type compact and 5 of the smaller compacts. They are all lovely but there is no comparison between the two. Anyone would be proud to gift this to some one they care about. My only little wish is that the clasp was easier to open and I would love to have a small velvet bag to put it in my purse. I am afraid the junk in my bag will damage the beautiful workmanship.<br />A friend was with me when the package arrived and she declared it a small treasure.... It takes several weeks for it to arrive from Soul South Korea so be sure and order well ahead of the event you wish to gift it.. worth the wait I assure you... Yes I love it.,3
4,"it is an OKAY product! I got it mostly because it is talc free (my skin is very sensitive) So depending on your skin, this product could work amazingly for you! My advice: try it, its affordable, see if it works for you! The color is really striking.",3
5,My daughter has had a toe nail fungus for a month or more. She plays basketball year round and we have tried several products for her toe nail. I have even tried medicated prescription that were prescribed by her doctor. Nothing seemed to work well. I sprayed asti Restore on her toenail 3 days ago and we see results already. She's begging me to order more! I highly recommend this product and am happy she finally found something that works. No odor and no mess. It's simple and easy to use.,3
5.0,excellent!!,3
5,"I have had extensions placed in for six months at salons, I've bought cheaper ones for nights out that haven't lasted... so I feel like I've got a broad idea of the quality out there on the market. These are wonderful for the price! I have thicker hair, so I did buy these and one other set so I could cut some layers in and have different lengths. I love them. They match my hair well enough and are super easy and quick to put in. I would highly recommend!",3
5,Love this hair spray. Light hold and you can comb it out if you need to. Will buy again.,3
5,Great curls no frizz!,3
4,It works on my oily skin! I love this!,3
5,"Fast shipping, seems to be a well made product.",3
5,Works great,3
5,It bigger then what i thought which is really good. It cute and im happy with it. I like everything in my purse to have a place and this prefect.,3
5,"Definitely worth the price, my skin feels a lot softer since using these with an exfoliate scrub.",3
5.0,The best part of my smartphone!,3
5.0,This gel was recommended to me by my oncologist when I was going through radiation for breast cancer. It really helped me and is also great for sunburns.,3
5,I have very problematic skin on my face and body. Its been about two months and its clearing up albeit very slowly. I started taking this with a multivitamin too following the advice of a friend. I have very oily skin on my face and I've noticed that the oil has reduced significantly. My lips are very dry though (invested in Aquaphor) but my skin overall is fine.,3
5,"this product came very quickly. Packaging was sturdy & safe. I did not enjoy the scent of the product BUT I enjoy the texture and the results! my skin feels very soft but tighten and my bags has almost disappear. I will purchase this item again, very soon!",3
4,Nice quality!,3
4,Good.,3
5,"Very happy with this purchase and I know my teeth are getting an A-! brushing compared to the battery operated Oral B electric brush I was using. The 12 heads are a BIG plus and they are quality brush heads. This particular brush took a little getting used to with the much power in the head, but I did get used to it after a week or so and now I really enjoy brushing. Very pleased!",3
5,These are perfect dental floss holders. I wish the Dentists would start handing them out. They are not that expensive and built well.,3
5,"This is truly a PREMIUM product,from the quality of the packaging to the actual cream itself.  I highly recommend this product.  Thanks Healing Touch....Please make some more creams!!!",3
5.0,"Some wrote about this product being for adults too. I have thick course hair with curls/waves. I cant stand the crunch from most products. This is perfect. It keep the frizz in check, was soft to the touch and smelled so good. I may never use anythinh else again.",3
4,Its so far so good. Ive been using it in my products for the past two weeks and on its own. I am happy with the results I have gotten and I dont really have any complaints with its effects on my skin. I do feel like it is a bit more smelly than others I have used but with fragrance oil that is cleared up.I like the product and I may purchase again. The packaging is temporary so If you do buy this be prepared to store in in a large plastic container to avoid a mess.,3
4,"It's huge! And it makes the water a light pink, it smells amazing too! I used mine about 2 days ago and I still smell like strawberries.",3
5,GREAT STUFF!  This gently removes wig tape and residue from expensive hairpieces.  Protect the investment you make in costly hairpieces with this!  Even cheap wigs are expensive-take good  care of them.  This solution also takes off too sticky price tags and TAKES BANDAGES OFF SKIN WITHOUT PULLING! (Wait till you are healed!)  So many uses for gluey sticky things that require gentle removal.,3
5,This is the best shampoo for natural black hair .......Everyone who's trying to go natural should use this....and everyone who's already natural will love it..  I will be ordering this product forever......,3
5,I ordered several because I haven't been able to find them in the store.  I use this everyday as a finishing touch to my makeup.,3
5,The product arrived quickly and smells so pure. The quality is good it manages my hair very well. This is a must have hair care product.,3
5,VERY GOOD,3
5,"Strong and effective enough to remove waterproof sunscreen and silicone based products.  A tube lasts a long time, you only need little, about 2cm of the product to wash your entire face.  After washing with this, it rinses off super easily and my skin feels super squeaky clean but not dry at all.  I use it as my nighttime cleanser for my nightly skincare routine, however I use the Oil Free Cleansing Liquid when I get home at the end of the day.  You don't need both, but it's just my preference to use the two in my skincare lineup.",3
5,I chose it because it was cheap and banana products I understand are OK. it's a good product. It's big and great for family use. it also arrived in great time and well packed. Totally recommended.,3
5,"This really does work as advertised. I got this for my wife for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. Her skin looks flawless after using it, and not all \\""made up.\\""  Just a very nice, smooth, matte finish that looks great and natural.  The product dispenses the make-up very evenly and smoothly - we've not experienced any clogging or uneven spraying. The tough part is making sure you pick the right color of foundation, but if you go to the Sephora site, it really helps you select the right shade for your skin. And the pods last much longer than you may think for their size.  Really cool product!",3
5,I had worn &#34;Nina&#34; for a while and I found this one. I like this one better because it has a sharper more appely scent to it (Nina has more of a incense smell to it). Only potential drawback is that it does have a sweeter dry down than I usually wear. But I love it!,3
5,"I use and love the Regenerist night cream and serum so decided to try this product also. I've used other scrubs and couldn't believe how different this one left my face feeling. The scrub itself is mild so it's not irritating at all. Once I've washed it off, my skin feels very soft and smooth, and the texture appears more even. I alternate this and the facial cleansing cloths for make up removal in the evening. One of the best plusses about this Olay product is that it's replacing a similar high-end facial wash I was using for which I paid 4 times the price of this.",3
5,Exactly what I needed for my trimmers! Saved me money! Sally Beauty supply had this for $22! Came pretty quickly also!!! Will defiantly be buying again! Actually I should have bought 2! :),3
5,ok,3
5.0,I love it. For some reason it has been dificult to fine Thanks for still carrying it,3
5,exceeded expectations perfect for my pets meds,3
5,"well priced, nice scent, goes on easily, absorbs quickly and leaves my face feeling nice and smooth/soft.  I wet shave with classic double edge razors and I'm always looking for a moisturizer to compliment my close shaves.  This Lucky Tiger really fits the bill...the price is pretty good compared to some others and does make my skin feel great.",3
5,"i got these gloves for my wife , she use them at night with her hand cream the cracking of her hands has improved greatly,<br />i thank they are great.",3
5,"I'm moving to place where there aren't many african-american salons and stylist, so i figured i'll be doing my own hair quite a bit. so i decided to purchase this dryer and I love it. My hair gets dry in 30 minutes on high and 45 minutes on low. I absolutly love it! I sent my blow dryer packing after using this the first time. what i love the most is that it has two fan speed settings, high and low and you can adjust the heat setting to whatever is comfortable for you because it does get as hot as the dryers in salons. the height is adjustable, and the hood is large enough to fit even your larges rollers comfortably. it comes in three peaces and very easy to assamble. I didn't even look at the directions when i assembled mine and best of all, it's QUIET.",3
5,Just reordered this product and felt the need to share my success with it.  I am pushing 70 and have experienced brow loss over several years.  My brows were also turning grey and unruly.  I first tried Jan Marini Hair Revitalizing Conditioner which made a considerable improvement.  However I got additional improvement on using this product.  Remember once those hair follicles are dead nothing will resurrect them so don't delay on taking steps to stop the hair loss.,3
5,My friend told me this shampoo helps to prevent hair falling down. Hope to see the result.,3
4,"This is a great product and am very happy with my purchase. The shipping was very fast and the price was extremely reasonable. The only negative would be that I ordered 2- 8 oz. bottles and received 4- 4oz. bottles, no big deal. If I had received what I actually ordered, would have left 5 stars.",3
4,"I've only been using this for a few days so I can't really report on the end result yet but I can say that it softens my skin, isn't the least bit greasy and I absolutely the the smell!  I'd give it 5 stars but I can't yet say what it will do for cellulite or skin tightening. As a matter of full disclosure, I am writing this review so I can receive a discount on future product. Mind you, I would care in the least about the discount if I didn't like this product enough to buy it again!!!",3
5.0,Best Shampoo ever!  This works great and I would recommend to all of people with hair loss issues.,3
5,"After reading a blog post about skin brushes, I had to try this thing out. I looked online and ordered this one. Before it came in, I saw others that were less expensive at the store. :( When this came in, I was not disappointed. This brush is super sturdy, dries really quickly after washing and has a detachable handle. (the ones at the store did not have detachable handles.) The brush never falls off it's handle.<br /><br />The handle is long enough, but not too long to fit in the cabinet.",3
5,Works like a dream! You get a great deep clean and I feel like it really pulls out all of the dirt and oils from your pors.,3
5.0,just as promied,3
5,"I've always had issues with my eyelashes not growing because I used to get styes a lot and I used to wear fake eyelashes, so I tried this product and after a month of using it my eyelashes have doubled, I even use it on my lower lids and it's awesome, I have lashes growing in spots that havent exsisted inYEARS... YOU GET 2 THUMBS UP FROM ME... but do know that you have to use it twice a day and be consistent with it.",3
5,got here fast and reasonably priced...,3
5,Another great bronzer from Physicians Formula. It comes with directions staying to simply apply bronzer in a large &#34;3&#34; shape on both sides of your face. It has cute packaging and has duel colors.  This bronzer is also matte. A lighter and darker shade. They can be blended together or use the lighter one as a high light. The bronzer comes with a brush and mirror like most PF bronzes. What is not to love? A,3
5,"I discovered this shampoo years ago when my hair stylist in Bloomington, Illinois, used it. Since that time, I have tried other shampoos, even high-priced products from companies like Redken, but I have never found one as good as Traite, so I always have gone back. It has absolutely no harshness, and whatever other moisturizing shampoos have claimed, they all have had an alkaline harshness that dried and toughened my hair. My skin is very sensitive to shampoos, conditioners, and lotions with any allergenic properties including fragrance, and Traite is the one thing I can use that doesn't irritate me in any way -- literally that doesn't make me break out in a rash or develop eye inflammation. It has a mild, almost coconut-like fragrance that is completely non-irritating. I now live in Massachusetts and have not found anyone in the beauty industry who has even heard of this product, so Amazon is the only way I have of buying it. It is worth every cent, and more.",3
5,"My two kids have been biting their nails for a couple of years and we have tried just about everything to stop it.  This is the only thing that has worked for them.  After about 10 days their nails are now starting to grow out and we can see white growing out from the nail beds.  The taste of Mavala is terrible (which is the point) but they want to continue to put it on because they are seeing the results. Needs to be reapplied about every other day.  They say it takes aprox. three weeks to start of stop a habit.  They haven't reached that time period yet, but are hopeful that once they do the product will not be necessary any more.  If it is, there will by plenty remaining in the jar so they will keep at it.  I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT!!",3
5,"I love this produce. My hair is a little frizzy and some products tend to leave my hair very oily. This product leaves my hair shiny, baby soft and no friz. You only need a small amount so it will last for ever.",3
5,easy to use and glittery too,3
5,"When I received this wig I was surprised because it was very white blonde and very long, down past my shoulders.  But the wig as a whole is wonderful.  I have had difficulty finding a hairdresser who will cut this wig like the picture.  A wig once cut, is cut.<br />The wig reminds me of a stock wig ready for styling which I think is great.  I will keep hunting for a good hairdresser to cut it like this delightful picture. Hairdressers charge a lot to cut a wig and that makes the cost of the wig double or triple.<br />My sister used to always cut my wigs, but, doesn't cut hair anymore.<br />It is advertised as a hew short blonde classical cropped chic curly shag bob wig, but, that is not quite what it really is.  That is not bad.  It's just not quite as pictured.",3
5,"This product changed my life. I had the worst breath imaginable, so bad even my wife stopped kissing me. I started using this 2X a day and the results were quick and dramatic! Not only does my breath taste fresher, but I have noticed people stop turning away when I talk too. I highly recommend this to anyone with breath issues.",3
4,"These were better than average, but I still have not found the perfect pair that will grab course facial hair.",3
5,A perfect travel size to fit in my boyfriends travel case.  This is his favorite fragrance so it was the perfect gift.,3
5,5star,3
5,"Nice color but I was looking more for a hunter green. However, this is a really nice earthy green color. Would be great for the fall.",3
5,"I am new to the whole shave soap, brush, and safety razor shaving. I love it tho and will never go back to the expensive multi-blades again. This brush is well built and helps create a good lather with the soap I use. A few hairs came off on the first couple of uses but I guess that is to be expected.",3
5,"I bought this for my daughter-n-law for Xmas present. She was very happy, because she loves this fragrance. No problem with the shipping. It got here in time for the holiday. This was my first time ordering and am sure I will be ordering again. Thank you.",3
5,Works really well.  I could see a result with one use.  Not messy like other teeth whitening products I have used which have been unpleasant.  You can put them on and go.  Very Pleased.,3
5,excellent,3
5,I have curly frizzy hair and this product has been amazing. The smell is very sensual and unisex - not fruity or flowery at all. I love it,3
5,I've discovered a product that exceeds what I thought it would. I would recommend this to everyone of my family and friends.,3
4,This set of eyeliner comes in colors that are great for adults.  They are VERY glittery and need to be used for very dramatic purposes.  They have the potential for elaborate and beautiful face art.  I struggled to mix them with a more serious makeup look.  I'd love to learn more about their possible uses.,3
4.0,"If you're a sweaty runner with any amount of bounce to your chest like me, Blue Steel begins to break down at the 4-mile mark (a little sooner in hotter weather).<br /><br />With Blue Steel, at about the 4.5 mile mark, you become very aware of your chafing parts.  At the 6-mile mark and beyond, you are feeling the full-on sting.<br /><br />As a result, I turn to body glide stick for anything greater than a 5K, but I use Blue Steel for 5Ks.  Body Glide Stick works for any half-marathon+ distance, but offers far fewer applications per package than blue steel.<br /><br />Blue Steel holds up well for the 5Ks.  There is enough in the tube for months of daily applications if you use it on the 3 spots I do (sensitive parts of chest and between the legs).  So while I recommend this for 5Ks, I wouldn't recommend it for longer runs.  It offers a few miles of protection from chafing.<br /><br />If your daily run consists of a few miles at a time, Blue Steel will work just fine.",3
5,"I bought this for my daughter. She has long, fine, but very thick hair. The amount of hair you can put into this thing is a lot smaller than you would put in rollers, but the curls are beautiful with no weird bends or crimps. It's easy to use on her long hair and the curl is consistent all the way to the end of her hair.",3
5.0,This brush is amazing! My wife told me that this is the best one she has owned and she is a cosmetologist.,3
5,"I have a lot of long (bra strap length) curly hair and this is the perfect bun. It is big enough that when i put my hair around it, I don't have to tuck 5 inches of hair around in an attempt to make it look neat. I recommend this for anyone who has hair that is too long to go over traditional sized bun forms.",3
5,As expected.,3
5,Clean Ultimate Perfume is my signature scent. I love it & I always get compliments about the way I smell!,3
4,"1. This is not 100% Coco Butter! Nothing on the Jar should lead you to expect this. It is a cream (lotion) made with Coco Butter, that is very hydrating.<br /><br />2. I too had some issues with the formula sitting on my skin in little spots, but I think I rubbed too vigorously when applying it to my hands. It is the only place on my body this happened. I will say, even when my skin appeared to have absorbed it completely, I could still feel it. I don't this this is any fault of the lotion, any one who has moisturized with pure coco butter know that this happens. It is an oil, and skin doesn't absorb oil perfectly. That't why oils are so good at helping skin heal, most provide some kind of barrier (however thin) that keeps moisture in, and keeps it from getting out.<br /><br />3. I don't know how much other people are paying for this product, but it should be relatively cheap. I got it at my local dollar store for...a dollar (no tax).<br /><br />This product isn't perfect, but it gets the job done.",3
5.0,Love the product and will order again. Thank you.,3
5,Keeps the dentist  away,3
5,"Product works great after doing a peel.  What I love about it most besides the fact that it works, is it smells amazing and almost calming.  It really helps sooth the skin!",3
4,"I was a little nervous after reading the previous reviews. A lot of people complimented the quality of the makeup, but were disappointed with the shipping and how it looked when they had received it. There were pictures of shadows completely demolished and cracked all over the place, however I received mine with everything perfectly in tact! Not sure where it came from, but it made it all the way to Jersey with no trouble. Anyway, I was also gratified with the timely manner in which it was shipped. I ordered it Thursday night/Friday morning and it came on Monday. The pigments of the makeup are very vibrant and rich throughout all of the colors, I would say they are easily comparable to MAC, HIP, or Bare Minerals, and at only a fraction of the price. I would say it was definitely money well spent, and a necessity for a college student such as myself who goes out a lot! Really a great snag!",3
5,"while I have not used the little nail buffer yet, the larger piece is very useful and lasts a decent amount of time",3
5.0,"I cant believe how much I got for such a cheap price! This will last forever... or a decent amount of time, but when it's finished I will be back here to buy it again.",3
5,excelente,3
5,"This is an awesome facial soap that is tough on dirt yet mild on skin! I have especially sensitive skin on my cheeks that would feel dry after applying an \\""ordinary\\"" body soap. I decided to shop around for a facial cleanser that would clean thoroughly but not dry the skin, and found that this fits the bill. I now use it regularly in my shower for my face.<br /><br />I haven't used the scrubber that comes with this soap, and can't comment on it.",3
5,For some reason all of the stores have stopped caring the &#34;sandy blond&#34;.  The price with prime shipping is about the same that I paid at CVS before they dropped it.  Just like the other JFM products this one does what it is suppose to do and last longer than the other products on the market.  I buy the 3 pack here and last me for a whole season.,3
5,"My shoulder and arm had been broken in a fall and I was frantic to get some relief from the pain.This product,Raymac Medic-moist Super Strength Pain Aid was what I took a chance on helping me.

4,"I really like this personal shaver.  It wasn't as close of a shave as I would have liked, but it did do the job and works great:)",3
5,I love this foundation!  It is perfect coverage for me and can be applied quickly.  My boyfriend does not like it because he thinks it adds too much coverage but it is perfect for me and I would buy it again! This is the only foundation I will wear during finals week because it covers my blemishes like no other.  Perfect 10!,3
5,First time using the cream and I like it. Its not blocking my pores and its not to greasy so seems to suit my skin :),3
5,"I have sensitive skin, most deodorants were too perfumed and not effective in keeping me dry and clean smelling and their perfumes irritated my skin.  5 Day is the best underarm deodorant I have ever used.  Protection lasts all day and does not irritate my skin!  Yayyyyy!",3
5.0,My favorite cologne at the best price. Thank you Amazon.,3
5,"Love love this fragrance, get compliments on it all the time.",3
5,Hung it in the bathroom so my daughter could brush her own teeth in the morning. She's not tall enough to see the vanity mirror so this helps.,3
5,"LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT! I can now use the different dot makers for all my nail needs, awesome!",3
4.0,"The perfume has a subtle, yet long lasting tone to it. It's extremely classy, and not too loud. The smell lingers on for quite a few hours after application, so it's a perfect wear for an event or a meeting. Highly recommended!<br />Sillage: Medium<br />Longevity: High",3
5,"i got some of this ink around two yrs ago and it was awesome ,it went in great and was bright and stayed bright,i had never heard of it and i must got it in a kit beause i've never ordered any of this kind before,but i was impressed with it,so i looked it up and found it ,and its made in the U.S.A. and i'm glad because i'm going to get me some of it,because 8 oz's of it for around 45.oo,so thats a good price for u.s.a. pigments,and thats less than 5.00 five dollars a ounce,that a great price,compared to them other top of the line inks.they got some nice primary colors to.i'm odering me a set soon. crazy rick",3
5.0,I like them because you have different colors to use  and pick right in front of you and nicely priced- delivery was right on time.,3
5.0,Muy buen perfume,3
4,A bit pricey but well worth it. Cleans well without leaving your skin feeling taut and dry.,3
5.0,Excelent. It isn't easy find this product,3
5,"Does exactly what it says. I bought this unit to replace the previous model when it broke, and it's great - good trims, easy operation. Additionally, it comes with a screen shaver attachment that my old one didn't have, but which works really well - it shaved almost as well as my manual razor.",3
5.0,"Easy to use, trims just right amount. Wish I'd had a long time ago. Shapes very well without leaving area prickly.<br />Highly recommend.",3
5,"I just love this pumpkin enzyme therapy mist! The smell is amazing and lasts all day! I am so upset this product was discontinued, but Thankfully I can get it online!! Thank you so much!",3
5,I have a few of these on hand in 1B and 1B-30... Haven't had any problems yet.  I love this wig!,3
5,This is my favorite VS Scent.  I love the new bottling also.  It looks very nice sitting on my vanity.,3
5,"Best deodorant ever! Natural, odorant free, safe and long lasting!",3
4,I would buy this again my BF and I use it all the time for dry skin and pain management.,3
5,Good product.,3
4,"It's not totally easy to remove but it isn't difficult either (I use soap and warm water). I definitely like the wand - it doesn't have big clumps here and there like other products. And I agree that if you didn't tell me it wasn't black, I wouldn't notice. Pretty much lasts all day but by evening I notice little flakes around my eyes so therefore the 4 stars.",3
5,This shaving brush is great.  The bristles are so soft and plentiful.  A really nice surprise.<br />The imitation ivory stand is very attractive.,3
5,great product for the price. I feel like it makes my skin look and feel smooth with a natural glow. Definitely one of the least expensive anti-aging creams that works well. I recommend it.,3
5,"I've been using this product for many years and I'm glad because, as a construction worker, I worked outdoors in some incredibly harsh weather and yet my face does not show it at all. I've recommended it to anyone wanting to keep their skin protected and youthful. There is nothing I've tried that worked better!",3
5,"Although I don't really believe most claims that one toothpaste can whiten more than another I find this one does.<br />I will say though, its way over priced and combine that with the shipping cost, it's one expensive toothpaste. I bought three travel sized and saved some money.",3
4,"Despite the high price, this product holds my hairdo the best.  It even holds the set through high humidity.  Apply to damp hair, dry and style.",3
5,"This is the only brand my mom will use, so I got this for her. She absolutely loves it. It smells just like the ones sold at the department store, and for way cheaper too!",3
5,"I use this in my hair which tends to have a dry texture and also as a moisturizer after my shower. The price on Amazon is great as well. And by the way, it is fragrance free.",3
5,Prefer this over the gels.  You can still feel the softness of your hair unlike stiff hair sprays that I have used in the past.,3
5,"this is so gorgeous. its just the perfect highlight shade for my medium skin tone, just enough gold and peach. it is strong so you don't need much. i would use a fan brush to apply it. it is expensive but this will last well over a year. leaves a natural glowing sheen on your face, worth every penny. it does get a little messy in the pan but that can be avoided by using a lighter hand. no need to swirl your brush all around because you will pick up way to much product. like i said a light sweep of a fan brush is more than enough. arrived very quickly and was packaged well. came with a free velvet draw string bag from the seller. pleased with entire experience.",3
5,"I ordered this because I need something to cover my eyes when taking a nap during the day and I saw the reviews for this and decided to order it,Im glad i got it,it is so soothing and cooling and it feels really comfortable over the eyes,this is a great product to have!",3
5,My favorite perfume ever!!!!,3
5,Best hairspray I've found for color treated hair. Combs out easily.Holds well nd doesn;t damage hair. Very happy with it.,3
5,"This cologne is amazing. The smell is fantastic. Not only did I like the cologne, but I got the package fast. I order on Tuesday, the 10th and got it on Friday the 13th. Very pleased. I will say though, that the package was damaged a little( the box had some weird part at the corner where it was scrunched up, but Ive seen worse cologne boxes at Wal-Mart-etc.",3
5.0,I love,3
5,"I had been wanting this perfune for the longest time, don't know what took me so long to purchase it but I finally did and I love it! The scent is smooth, clean and pleasant. It would be better for winter but all year-round would work just fine as long as you remember that a little goes a long way...",3
5,"This is the best hand sanitizer on the market today, because there is no alcohol in it. I have given some to friends and they like it too. Great product Gold Bond.",3
5,Great Price and good quality.,3
5.0,This was the first product I got through Amazon Pantry (auto-delivery) because I love it so much. My husband and I both use this. Its great because it has virtually no smell. Its a face and body moisturizer that goes on very light but locks in moisture. Great for the summer!,3
4,"I love the idea of this. It's very well packaged and the five plastic 2oz bottles are perfect for travel. I am a bit less than impressed with the fragrance. I think that [[ASIN:B0066GR55K Captain's Choice Original Bay Rum 4.0 oz After Shave Pour]] is the Bay Rum standard against which others are judged IMO and this just doesn't measure up. I was particularly keen to try the peppercorn/lime - nice, but disappointing.",3
5,LOVE IT!!!!!,3
4,Although these seeming are made well the question is will they last.  They work as well as expected.  They are stamped with the Revlon name but are made in China which is the reason for the 4 star rating.,3
5,"Loved the shades and color, had many choices to choose from. Nothing was broken since it came in very good packaging with a lot of bubble wrap. Honestly I bought this so I can practice apply makeup since I'm a beginning. I also ordered a Sephora value set but I like this one a lot better! The only thing is the pigment isn't strong enough for my skin and eyes so I need to apply more to my eyelids. Other that then its worth every penny.",3
5,This flossed cleans in between teeth with no harsh pulsation.  Comes with two pics. Would recommend this to a friend.,3
5,The color is exactly the same in the gel as it is in regular polish. Gel is so much easier.,3
5.0,Use this once a month and your skin will be flawless! It has improved my complexion and reduced dark spots I had because it kicked out the dead cells and facilitated new skin cells to make my face smooth and blemish free. I wash this off with cool water and use witch hazel toner and vitamin c serum to hydrate my skin.,3
5.0,"I went to Marshall's store and found it for $5.99<br />Works great. So I think $25.99 is to much to pay.<br />look for it at TJMAX or Marshall's.<br />Works great on curly hair, I just raked it on to my<br />hair when wet and let dry natural.",3
5,good,3
4,"As described, and small.",3
5,"This has been an excellent purchase for my husband and me. My husband used to use too much pressure while brushing; this toothbrush alerts him as well as adjusts when he's overdoing it. I love the different brush heads that allow me access to difficult to reach areas and to &#34;polish&#34;, just like the dentist does after a cleaning. If you've had oral care issues in the past, this is the brush for you.",3
5,"Folds well, very lightweight, glad it's there on the days we need it.",3
5,Just as advertised. Really recomend this for somebody that has nobody to give a hand. With no shaving cream is perfect and with it is even better. Buy it. Personnally recommend it.,3
5,After two weeks I like it.  Very close shave.  Holds charge well.  Easy to clean.  Well made.  I would recommend this.,3
5,This is a great shampoo and leaves your hair squeaky clean.  This item has been discontinued from many stores and I still love it.  Happy to find it at Amazon!,3
5.0,Great item!,3

5,Great product at a great price.  Been using for over a decade and I have yet to be disappointed or switch to a new brand.,3
5,Great,3
4,"Unwaxed dental floss is very hard to find in stores these days. Unwaxed does a much better job of removing plaque on my teeth. This Reach unwaxed floss gets between my tight teeth and does the job, even though I have to use about a yard for each cleaning. It shreds a little on each tight space, but they all do. This stuff is fairly good quality.",3
4,I like it becuase it does do my back as it was described to do..the blades need to be more durable,3
5,". I use to put my concealer and primer on with my hands and a brush. These are wonderful. Easy to clean. Do take some time to dry but a little wetness actually helps smooth your makeup on. They give me an even, smooth look.",3
5,One star,3
5,This product really does make a difference on how my skin looks.  I have only used it for about 5 days and I'm very pleased with the results.,3
5,Very high quality basic back brush.  Dense bristles that clean while floating over the skin.  I'm very happy with it.,3
5,What a wonderful product made my skin feel healthy and refreshed. I love the combination of ingredients in the product. I will absolutely buy this product again either for myself or as a nice gift,3
5.0,Exactly what we needed.,3
5.0,MY FAVORITE,3
5,"I have a particular comb that I like and use daily. Even with frequent soaking, hair product collects where the teeth meet the crossbar and it just seems sticky and not clean. We had one of these little gadgets when I was growing up and I have been looking for something similar for quite a while. I was glad to find this little gadget. It works fine for getting the gunk out of my favorite comb.",3
5,"I had originally purchased this perfume in France for my wife many years ago. I had problems finding it in the US until recently, This was an excellent deal on a good size dispenser of this great perfume. It came packaged well and arrived in a timely matter.",3
5,"This is my favorite nail polish remover.  The first time I bought it, I didn't realize it contained acetone, but I was so pleased by the product that I continue to buy it as my only polish remover.  It is gentler than any other acetone-based polish remover I have ever used (the added Vitamin E is probably responsible for that), and it smells terrific.  It works wonderfully, as well.",3
5,"I've been using it morning and night for about 4 weeks now. My mind automatically stresses me out, and with the combo of bruxism, insomnia, and waking up with headaches on and off for the past 10 years... I can't remember a time of when I didn't have dark circles.<br />I'm seeing a real difference, which amazes me every morning. The puffiness is reducing, which is slowly helping with the appearance of the dark circles' starting points near my nose. Basically, I'm already noticing about a 30% improvement.<br /><br />With my sensitive skin and a liking to Burt's Bees products I bought a tube of this for half price/$7.50 at a local store. The fact that I'm still using the same tube makes a $12 price seem fair.<br /><br />BEWARE first timers. Don't force the lotion out. My first time I kept squeezing until it burst out of the tip. It probably wasted about 5 days of applications since I didn't have a way to save it. Hold it between your thumb and forefinger about a 1/2\\"" down the tube. Slowly squeeze it/increase pressure until you feel it might burst on you with anymore pressure. Keep this pressure and wait for it to come out at its own pace.<br /><br />I'll update this if it stops improving and I find an alternate product, but I don't think I can ask much more of such an affordable, all-natural product.",3
5,Feels really silky on my skin.  Have only been using it for a short time but I love how soft it makes my skin.,3
5,"This soap is very nice. It a foaming soap, so as it flows thru the dispenser it coverts itself from a liquid to a very luxurious white foam. I don't buy into the anti-bacterial soap movement as those kill good bacteria as well as bad. This is not anti-bacterial, but very moisturizing.",3
5,"Husband loves it, was a Christmas present. Very good price and will check back when this runs out. I will",3
5,"I have had and tried almost every flat iron out there and this is the best one! It does not pull your har and gives a smooth sleek look without continuous strokes and that to me is a big deal when in a hurry or just simply not wanting heat damage. I use Bedheads after party smoothing lotion (use sparingly) and it gives a great shine. You can adjust the heat setting and the flashing light indicator lets you know when it's ready (red when not blue good to go) and only takes like one minute to heat up! Feels sturdy and the plates are positioned to where it feels like a cushion so it doesn't pull your hair, hence my earlier statement. It's worth the money and the warranty stands when purchasing through here where some does not when sold through second or third party vendors. I'd highly recommend! Hope this helps. I have long hair as well and the rounded edges make it easy for hair bend styles, flips or curls.",3
5,Best product I have used. I highly recommend to any lady that wants smooth skin. Great for me. I am 75 yrs young.,3
5,"I bought this for travel because I was tired of bottles leaking or breaking and spoiling my carefully-packed clothes. It's perfect for storing and organizing your beauty care items at home as well - looks adorable on a makeup table or sink.  Would make a good gift, too.",3
5,"Excellent service and excellent product!  It is all that you would want to help with the reducing of fine lines and the appearance of aging skin.<br />I have tried many products but this one has helped in a way no other product has when applied consistently and over a short period of time,<br />In one month I began to see a difference, in two months much more, and now in my third month the improvement is such that others who know my age are complimenting my more youthful appearance. .<br />The customer service is the best that I have ever experienced.  It is because of the genuine caring customer service that I continued the second month and love the results that have followed.",3
5,"The Seche base coat and top coat are superior products with one flaw they thicken to an unspreadable gel very quickly. A few drops of the restore and you have that most perfect top coat again.<br />I believe restore is the best nail polish dilution product on the market.<br />Read the directions ..not shaken and not stirred , rotate back and forth between your hands .",3
4,"The flexball works great. So far, the shave feels great. I wonder if 100 years from they come up with &#34;Gillette laser&#34;. And you get a lightsaver instead of blades",3
5,This is a beautiful fire/pink/orange color.  Very bold!  I look forward to wearing this color this summer and using it with other brights.,3
5,"I really love this lotion! I tried many other moisturizers before and they all seemed to clog my pores, it looked terrible, however this one is perfect! my skin was kind of oily with the other lotions i tried before and it looks so good now! i recommend it!",3
5,"My husband really likes Gillette Series Cool Wave Aftershave Splash. He likes the fragrance and the way it feels on his skin.  Gillette Cool Wave Splash has a fresh, clean masculine scent that is not too overpowering. I think it smells great!     Cool Wave has been my favorite after shave scent for several years and has been difficult to find in my town. So glad Amazon sells it (pack of 6) and at a good price too.",3
4.0,"Cool, moderate pale colours! thank you. I am shopping another time more colours. I try it rouge, eye mouth pencil. Distinguished Maybelline products!",3
5,"I absolutely love this foundation, I cant get enough of it, I wear it everyday to work, being transgendered it covers my face with a smooth glow, Im hooked on this for life",3
5,"Excellent aroma, excellent presentation, is an ornament in my dresser. I smell it again and again, and delight. Always take advantage of these deals that are available and so no regrets later. Great perfume and also share some great artist such as Michael Jackson.",3
5,"Tastes great, and works good. This might be my favorite toothpaste.  Great packaging.  You won't waste any toothpaste.  I highly recommend trying this toothpaste.",3
5,Don't leave this color lying around ANYWHERE!!!  Color pops and catches the eye.  Great to use as a solid or as background for designs.,3
4,"Pros:<br />* Only need a small amount for most hair styles. On average, a pea sized amount is enough to handle short to medium-short hair. This means a jar will last quite some time.<br />* Holds even the thinnest and finest hair. With a little of the product and some styling, even stubborn baby fine hair has volume that lasts for hours.<br />* Works great on both male and female hair.<br />* Product does have a fragrance but it is not terribly offensive. It does take a little getting used to but there are far worse smelling products out there.<br />* Can handle light rain/mist without washing out, perfect if you live somewhere that gets a lot of rain.<br />* Makes dry hair feel slightly more moisturized.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Hard to find. Other than at one salon, I had no luck finding it locally. The salon charged almost $10 more per container, so buying it on Amazon is likely to be the better deal.<br />* Can be a little hard to work with. The product is very sticky/thick, so a little goes a long way. It can also clump or \\""gunk\\"" up hair if too much is applied at once. The better way to deal with this is use the smallest amount possible then apply more as needed. If you are new to this product, you may want to practice with it a few times before you add it to your normal styling routine.<br /><br />Who This Is Good For:<br />* Anyone looking for a choppy or messy style that stays put.<br />* Anyone with fine/thin hair who wants bigger volume.<br /><br />Additional Notes:<br />* As mentioned above, price varies widely depending on where you go. Amazon's price ($12 currently) is the best I've been able to find from somewhere reliable. Since it lasts a long time, it probably won't matter if you pay a bit more to buy locally.",3
5,"By far my favorite face sunscreen!<br /><br />I've tried numerous drugstore facial sunscreens and every one of them made my skin break out.<br /><br />This goes on easy. Dries quickly. Doesn't have that \\""sunscreen\\"" smell. And I'm able to put makeup over it or blend it into my foundation.<br /><br />It WORKS!",3
5,"Finally found what I needed (correct refills) after buying the wrong ones in the stores.  I guess you can find refills at some of the \\""Big Box Stores,\\"" but I got tired of running around town to find the ones I needed.  Works for me!",3
5,Lip Stick is very moist and easy to put on. I've been using the Olay moisturizer for several years and love it.,3
5,Love it!!! Just too expensive..,3
4,It does last 24 hours.  Be careful and light of hand in putting it on.  It is a very dark shade.,3
5,"I've seen these advertised with different curling irons and thought they would be handily when using my flat iron for curling my hair.  So far so good.  As the description said you can't hold it to the heat source for long but it is great for those glancing burns.  If nothing else it helps me not to be as nervous, allowing me to make better curls.  Came very quickly and with no issues.",3
5,"Love this item!<br />Wish the lip gloss was darker, it is very sheer.<br />Love the Watts Up- somewhere between a<br />concealer & a brightener for under your eyes.<br />Not really small enough to carry in your purse,<br />but maybe in a tote.",3
5,Quality product. use it for mixing and applying facial creams or masks. I'm happy with this purchase.  It's inexpensive and will to the job if you're looking for something similar.,3
5,I've been using this electric razor for years. I replace the foil and cutter about every 18 months and it always works fine.,3
4,works well,3
5,"I dyed my hair black over a full head of super blonde highlights and haven't trimmed my hair in two months! I use this twice a week. I put it on my hair, throw on a shower cap and do stuff around the house for 30 minutes. I rinse it out and my hair is so soft and shiney. My hair should look like a rats nest, thanks to cholesterol cream it looks great :) highly recommend - can't go wrong for the price - try it",3
5,I use this in the shower (last thing I do) every time and I haven't used body lotion in years.  Your skin will be so soft and moisturized.  It is addicting!,3
4,"So far, so good.  I've only used a couple of times and seems to do a pretty good job.  It doesn't shave as close as a hand razor but that is to be expected.",3
5,"The first few times I used this product I pumped out way too much and I had a tough time getting it all off; this stuff really lathers up using very little cleanser.  So now I've learned to use just a dab and it still lathers up really well.<br /><br />I like the scent and feel of my skin after using it.  I have sometimes oily, sometimes dry skin and after using this my face feels clean and soft.  I have had no adverse effects from it.  I really like that it comes in a pump instead of having to pick it up and pour out some in my hand.<br /><br />This cleanser comes in a 6.77 ounce container and for the amount that I use each time this should last me for months!  This is the first time I've tried a Biore product and I like it!",3
5,"I have been doing my own manicures for years, and I love Sally Hanson products. This is an extremely beautiful color! This is quite opaque so you need several coats, but it is well worth the time and the money!",3
5,"I have used these rollers for years!  The curls are big and beautiful, not the skinny old woman look of the old fashioned foam curlers, and if you roll them from the middle, you get ringlets! I wash, mousse, hold the hair up, hold the curler up to the middle of the strand, and wrap the hair around the curler first, tucking the end of my hair where it'll be rolled, then roll the rest of it up, twisting extra tight, and snap. It's so easy, my 6 year old can do it. It takes about 5 minutes to curl my flat hair, thick hair would be maybe ten. I have hair to my shoulders, stick straight, and the curls, after sleeping in them, (I suggest a hair net) last all day, even on rainy days running errands, with no hairspray!  These curlers are meant for sleeping in. My daughter has hair halfway down her back.  The curl lasts for two days, more if I didn't bathe her.  Not for curling dry hair. (Use hot rollers for that.) They are designed for long hair. I suggest Velcro rollers if your hair is less than 6 inches long.    I have only one complaint, they don't last forever. After about 3 years of use, the foam is starting to break down.  Too bad they aren't memory foam! I'm about to buy some more, though, because there's no other product like it!",3
5,"It bent already but it gets the job done. If you have hair you can pik, this is a good buy.",3
5,"actually, i real like it. i think price is reasonable. and then smells is so nice! In summary,i love it so much",3
5,"I like the feel, and the color is very natural.",3
5,This color is perfect for me porcelain skin tone. It's the lightest concealer I've ever been able to fine and I love it!,3
5.0,"I really liked this product. It is expensive, but I believe it's worth it.",3
5,"Great help for reaching areas beyond upper front for me.  I use a smaller brush for my face and neck, but have some limited mobility with my dominant hand that this works well for.",3
4,This hair is pretty and wish it was 22 inches I feel like I was cut a little short and this wig does not have combs its a full last so u would need glue or u will need 2 sew combs in like I did this will the hair very full beautiful when u brush the curls out and add water. I have pictures on my Instagram @famous_bryana,3
5,Good!,3
5,My granddaughter has suffered from terrible sweating.  It effected her life constantly and she was always concerned about her fashion because the tshirts always showed sweat stains.  She say sweatblock advertised.  I purchased her first box about 6 months ago and it has changed her life.  Thank you sweatblock for allowing her to stop being so concerned about stains and sweating.  She is a new kid as a result of sweatblock!!!!,3
5.0,great smell for a woman.... can't find bcbgirl star... well i can but not spending the money on it since its no longer being made. this is a &#34;GREAT&#34; replacement for it i definitely encourage lovers of bcbgirl star to purchase this.... &#34;AMAZING SMELL&#34;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,3
5,"This is perfect, does exactly what I need.  I keep in a drawer with my Mae-up and use as needed. Much better than redoing all the lighting in bathroom. Recommend!",3
5,"My husband picked this one out for me on our Honeymoon at Downtown Disney in CA. I have worn many, many perfumes, but no other scent gets the attention and compliments that this one does. I cannot tell you how many people stop me and ask what it is. One bottle lasts me about a year, no other perfume makes me feel like this one does, it actually makes me feel beautiful!",3
5,"My mother had been wearing the same perfume for 30 years - Chanel No. 5.   Every Christmas, we would buy her another bottle at her request.  But it was really getting old, and too me, perfumes are to overbearing anyway.  So I looked for something new. <br /> <br />I found Amazing Grace by philosophy.  Their frangrances are perfect - they are simply light refreshing scents, which is what a \\""fragrance\\"" should be, though surprisingly is pretty hard to find.  This was not strong and heavy like any other perfumes I've come across.  It smells \\""fresh and clean\\"" - I don't know how else to describe it.  Anyway, as picky as she is, she loved it, and asked for it again this year.  Also check out their \\""Falling in Love\\"" fragrance.  I liked it so much, I bought this one for myself, and I've never liked perfume for myself.",3
5,I love using all the Elizabeth Arden ceramide products.  My skin looks good for my age and I will continue to use these products.,3
5,"Olay sensitive soap is the only soap I can use that does not break me out or cause irritation. Unfortunately it is not sold in stores anymore, only available online.",3
5,The product shipped very quickly and the mask works like magic. It pulls out grime from your pores and you can feel it pulsating when applied. I will use this product for the rest of my life.,3
5,Works like expected. Can't have any problems with it. This blade is very sharp. I adjusted mine to get a closer shave and they are perfect,3
5,Was delivered very quickly and I would recommend anytime,3
5,"This is just what I need.  Have thinning graying brows that dissappear if not tinted. Have tried other products but they never quite did the trick. This is a great product. Have already reordered \\""just in case\\"".",3
5,"love this product...it adds so much personality to nails & toes... have to be gentle whrn using them, they roll everywhere lol! thank you",3
4,"It is picking up the area that looked like my face was sliding off.<br />I will know more later, but after 1 month, I am happy!",3
5,Amazing variety of colors really loved it for the price it's great. The color appears what it is that's a plus!,3
5,"First, mine came with a travel case and two toothbrushes. Ive used the Braun electric toothbrush with quite satisfactory results since 1990.  To a large extent, the work is being done by the brush heads, therefore one can get different results depending on which you use.  To a large extent, I find the wide array of brushes unnecessary.  Now to the Sonicare.  The first thing I did was to deactivate the 14 day ramp up system. This is good for first time electric toothbrush users.  You generally get a little bleeding when you start with an electric toothbrush.  Next I noticed how small the brush heads are.  Now on to my perceptions. The head actually moves very little compared to the Braun Oral-B system. But this does not equate to less effective cleaning.  This seems to clean much quicker to to the much more rapid vibration than the Oral-B.  At the end of the 2 minute timer, my teeth were clean.  An impressive feat.  So, I recommend this without hesitation.",3
5,My wife uses this product every day.  She loves it.,3
5,This is a great smelling body oil.,3
5,My mom was so happy with her gift,3
5,This item was not well packaged and so when I received it about half the contents were on the outside of the plastic packaging. Amazon was wonderful and refunded the purchase. My hair was in such bad shape that I decided to use the remaining product instead of pitching it. Wow. This is an unbelievable product. The jar is tiny but I have thick long hair and a little goes a long way. I have literally tried everything on my hair (even sheep placenta which gets rave reviews on here from the all natural crowd) and this is the BEST conditioner I have ever used. Will purchase again.,3
4,I love this Blush ...searched everywhere for it after seeing it on YouTube. Perfect for dark tone African American women. I'm impressed ...one of favorite daily blushes.,3
5,perfect,3
5,"Easy to use, natural color, and no mess.",3
5,"I've gotten tons of compliments on how white my teeth look since using these strips. I've gotten three other people to try them out, too, and I've heard nothing but good things. They haven't worked as well for my dad as they did for me but he drinks A LOT of coffee. :)",3
5,My razor vibrates...  what does yours do?,3
5,Good natural face wash that doesn't dry out your skin. It does not foam up that well which some might not like but it's not a problem for me since it still gets the job done without a big lather.,3
5,"After dealing with many unwanted chin hairs for years, this was heaven sent! I've been through electrolysis several times, tweezed for years and was considering laser hair removal. But I was so thrilled with this little epilator I will never have to turn to any of those again! It didn't hurt any worse than tweezing, but got ALL of the hairs in just a 2 minutes! I keep feeling and staring at my chin now (lame I know) but I haven't had a hair free chin in years! Don't think twice about getting this if you have unwanted hairs...you won't regret it!",3
5.0,"These help prevent me from grinding my teeth at night. I bring these wherever I go, it's awesome.",3
5,Love the fiber extensions! It maximizes my already beautifully long lashes and it's no need for me to use glue/stick on lashes when I have this product. Easy to apply and remove but it LASTS during the time you wear it. The eyeliner was just a bonus! Nice bang for your buck with this one!,3
5,"When I purchased the tummy honey butter, I wanted something to prevent stretch marks on my growing tummy and also to relieve the constant itching I was experiencing. Since using the tummy butter, I haven't seen any stretch marks forming and it has helped minimize itching. I love this product!",3
5,I've been looking for a crystal file for some time now and never found one that I liked. this one was amazing! It's thick enough that i dont feel like I'm going to break it by putting pressure on it and yet the tip is small enough to get to the edges of my nails. I am totally going to buy this again for friends as stocking stuffers for Christmas.,3
5,This is the best store brand mascara out there! I have tried over 40+ mascaras over the years and this is my favorite. Makes your lashes long with A LOT of volume.,3
5,"Yep, this dry fast nail coat really works. I am happy with the product and was glad that it wasn't false advertising.",3
5,"Nice cap. Bought two, one for me and for someone else. They work just fine. Feel nice on my head too. I'd buy another in the future.",3
5,How could you not love a mirror that works in the shower.  Great and haven't had a fog up yet.,3
5,"Previously bought this balm, and whenever I used it it was like applying fresh cream to my body!  The scent is so unique, I do not have to apply perfume.  I just have purchased this item again, and will continue as long as it is available.",3
5,Smells and feels wonderful. What a relaxing few minutes to escape from it all!,3
